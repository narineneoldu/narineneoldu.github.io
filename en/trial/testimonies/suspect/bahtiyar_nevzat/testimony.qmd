## Presiding Judge

Presiding Judge : Mr. Nevzat, the indictment has been served to you. You have read it. According to the indictment, it is requested that you be punished for killing Narin Güran in participation with the other defendants. What do you have to say? I am listening. Go ahead.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I am only remorseful.

Presiding Judge : Start from the beginning. Where were you on the day of the incident? How did you meet? Whom did you meet? Let's start from that. Why did you call Salim? Start from there.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had called Salim for water.

Presiding Judge : Yes, can you take the microphone? You will be more comfortable. Okay, now I am listening.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I called for water.

Presiding Judge : Why?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Our water supply had been cut off.

Presiding Judge : Your water supply had been cut off? Now... Okay, your water was cut. You called. Then?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Do I have the right to speak? Or do I also have the right to remain silent?

Presiding Judge : You have all rights. But to our questions... Tell us the incident so we can direct our questions accordingly. Do you want to tell the incident?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Very well... You have statements given to the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor's Office. Are those statements correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : They are correct.

Presiding Judge : Which is correct? There is a difference between one statement and the second statement. Is the most recent statement you gave the correct one?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The most recent statement I gave is correct.

Presiding Judge : Are you repeating that statement exactly?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Is the most recent statement you gave correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : You are repeating that statement here in court now, are you not?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : Okay. Let me briefly read your statement. I will go through these quickly. Following this, Salim Güran told me "I will call the authorities about the malfunction." Afterwards, there was no further conversation between us. Immediately after this conversation, I left my residence and, using a water hose from my neighbor mother’s residence, which is adjacent to me, I began to water the trees in front of my residence. Although my mother is our neighbor, the water lines that come to our residences are different and because there was a fault only in the water line coming to my residence, I was able to take water from my mother's residence. Approximately 15 minutes after I began watering the trees in front of my residence, from the garden of the residence belonging to Arif Güran, which is approximately 100 meters from my residence and located at a higher elevation relative to my residence, Salim Güran called out to me from there saying he had business with me, that he would come to me by vehicle and that I should prepare; upon this I stopped watering the trees and began waiting for Salim Güran in front of my residence.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I had gone up.

Presiding Judge : What do you mean?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had gone to Arif Güran's house.

Presiding Judge : Now after he said "I have business with you, come," did you go up on foot?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I went up.

Presiding Judge : Where was your car at that time?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : My car was down below.

Presiding Judge : It was down below. You were around Arif Güran's house on foot, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : Where was Salim Güran in the meantime?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He was up above.

Presiding Judge : Where do you mean by "up above"?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean above our house.

Presiding Judge : Is "above your house" the area of Arif Güran and his barn?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : Did you meet there with Salim Güran?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : When you met there, who else was present?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see anyone else.

Presiding Judge : Now Mr. Nevzat, at 15:18, at 15:08 you call Salim and you have a phone conversation. At 15:18 you are near Arif's house. When he called you while you were near Arif's house, did you see anyone else besides Salim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : No. "Approximately 15 minutes after I began watering the trees in front of my residence, from the garden of the residence belonging to Arif Güran, which is approximately 100 meters from my residence and located at a higher elevation relative to my residence, Salim Güran called out to me saying he had business with me, that he would come to me by vehicle and that I should prepare; upon this I stopped watering the trees and began waiting for Salim Güran in front of the residence." you said in your earlier statement. In your statement here in court you said you went on foot, you did not go by car. At that time you said you did not see any person or vehicle in the area. A few minutes later Salim Güran arrived in front of my residence with a Renault vehicle bearing license plate 47 XX 388, coming from the direction of the mosque within the village rather than from the school.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : Now when Salim Güran said to you "Come, I have business with you," where was he such that he later came by car — I do not understand?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He had business up above.

Presiding Judge : Okay.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was in the courtyard watering the trees. He said "I have business with you" and asked "Will you come up?" I said okay I am coming.

Presiding Judge : Okay, after that was he in his car at that time?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He was waiting outside. He did not have a car.

Presiding Judge : This leads to a contradiction here too. "He told me 'Get in the car immediately and follow me'." Did such a thing occur?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : It did not. At that time I did not see anyone or any blanket in the vehicle Salim Güran was using. When Salim Güran moved off in his vehicle I then followed him with my vehicle registered to my son but used by me, bearing license plate 23 XX 630. These places were not like that then. It is not like that. You met entirely on foot. So why did you give such a statement to the prosecutor then?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was somewhat frightened.

Presiding Judge : Of whom were you frightened?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had been frightened then because he had threatened me with a firearm and with my family, so I could not give my statement fully and comfortably then...

Presiding Judge : You did not give it fully and comfortably. Are you under any pressure, torture, or violence at present?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : You are giving these statements now of your own free will, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : Was any pressure exerted on you to make these statements or to change these statements for those listening to them after this investigation or after the lawsuit was filed?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Was anyone offering money saying "Nevzat, accept the crime, admit that you killed Narin, confess, we will look after you, we will look after your children, we will give you land"? Was such an offer made? Such an offer was not made by Salim Güran and his family, right?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see such a thing at all.

Presiding Judge : So, has anyone made such an offer to you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Not in prison. Okay. Now we will actually read this statement. After we resolve these contradictions, then I proceed to the part you described in your second statement. "Later we entered Arif Güran's house together with Salim Güran. When we entered this house there was one room. All the doors of the rooms were closed." Is that correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : "I did not see Enes Güran, Yüksel Güran, Eren Güran, Muhammed Güran or anyone else inside the house."

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : "As I did not hear any noise, I do not know whether those in the closed rooms were present inside them."

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : "When we entered the house and Salim Güran took me to one of the rooms on the left, I saw Narin Güran lying motionless on the floor."

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : Now Mr. Nevzat, what puzzles me is this. Salim told you "Come I have business." You went to Salim, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : At that time did you hear any shouting, any scream, any sound related to the killing of the child from inside the house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : So you did not hear any shouting from the house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Then you did not know why Salim had called you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : At first I did not know.

Presiding Judge : At first you did not know. When you entered the house and saw Narin's corpse you learned. I will ask this question repeatedly. Think carefully. Was there anyone else at the location in question besides Salim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Are you sure?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I am sure.

Presiding Judge : Arif's house and Salim's house are adjacent. There is not a large distance between them. They can hear each other's shouting. When you looked at Salim's house was there anyone there?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : No. Okay. "When we entered the house and Salim Güran took me to one of the rooms on the left, I saw Narin Güran lying motionless on the floor. As I recall there was a foam-like fluid coming from Narin Güran's mouth. Salim Güran told me that because Yüksel and I were together the girl saw us, that this girl killed me. I killed this girl. Now you are also my accomplice. You witnessed this event. Therefore you will eliminate this. Otherwise I will take your son from the football school he attends and shoot him in the head," threatening me and offering me money." you had stated.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : Could you tell this to us again? You entered the house.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had entered the house. I went in, I looked, he took me into a room. I looked, Narin was lying there. She was lying there. He told me such an event.

Presiding Judge : What did he mean by "such an event"?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : That she had a relationship with his mother.

Presiding Judge : So then is it like this: While Salim and Yüksel were having sexual intercourse, Narin came home and saw them; because she saw them they killed her, is that what he said?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : He said so. But now at 15:08, look, we have these HTS records. What is the brand of the phone you used?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Samsung.

Presiding Judge : Was it an A5?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : C3.

Presiding Judge : It was something like that, okay. We have looked at it. Not very important. Which SIM did you use?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Thirty-three.

Presiding Judge : Turkcell. Now look, when the HTS report is obtained you call Salim at 15:08 regarding water, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : Then about 10 minutes later, at approximately 15:18, you are near Arif's house. Salim tells you to come. Correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : According to the latest camera footage in the file, according to the latest camera footage in the file Narin appears on the path from Tavşantepe school toward the trail at 15:15. Let's add 5 minutes to Narin's arrival at home. Let's say 20 minutes. At 15:20 during this interval was Salim with you? At what time did he have intercourse with Yüksel so that Narin saw?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I did not see.

Presiding Judge : I ask again. At 15:08, at 15:18 when he said "come," did you see Salim at all before he said "come"? Until he said "I have business with you" did you see him?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see him.

Presiding Judge : But you were around the house in the meantime.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was at home.

Presiding Judge : Which house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : My own house.

Presiding Judge : Were you at your own house watering the garden?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I was watering the garden from my own house.

Presiding Judge : Approximately how many meters are there between your house and Arif's house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : There are around 50 meters.

Presiding Judge : How about Salim's house? Is that also very close?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It is also close.

Presiding Judge : So you did not see Salim outside during that time.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : When you first saw Salim did he come out of Arif's house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see him then.

Presiding Judge : You only saw Salim in the garden.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I watered in the garden. He came up and I saw him. I did not see anyone else.

Presiding Judge : You did not see from where he came up.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Did you see where Salim's car was at that time?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see his car there.

Presiding Judge : You did not see his car either. While you were watering at your home — because I repeat this repeatedly, because we are taking fragmented statements, so that our statements are clear, okay? — therefore I keep asking repeatedly. After you called Salim and while you were watering in your garden, after approximately how many minutes? After about 10–15 minutes upon Salim calling out to you you saw Salim, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : Apart from that you saw nothing else.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Okay. You entered the house. You saw Narin's corpse in the house. Then what did you discuss with Salim? Could you tell that part to us again?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Then he told me, you will take it and make it disappear.

Presiding Judge : Take it where, make it disappear?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Take it and throw it somewhere.

Presiding Judge : There is a missing part in the statement here. Mr. Nevzat. Now you entered the house. After seeing the corpse what plan did you make? Who advised you to get a sack? Who advised you to take it to the relevant stream and throw it there? How did you plan these? Who thought of it? Where did the idea come from? Or who told you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Salim told me.

Presiding Judge : Did Salim tell you to "make it disappear"? To take the corpse, to the streambank, to leave it there?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. He said put it there. Also throw it into the water in pieces. So that no one sees, let it disappear. I then took it there.

Presiding Judge : Have you ever seen another corpse in your life?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : It is the first time you have seen a corpse. Where does this composure come from? I mean, while a person who sees a corpse should be flustered, how did you manage to take the corpse, put it in a sack or whatever and carry it somewhere with such composure while doing these things?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was somewhat affected. When I first saw, my whole body, so to speak, seized up. But after he told me, I was compelled. I had to do it.

Presiding Judge : With what did he threaten you?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : He threatened me with a firearm.

Presiding Judge : What did he say?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : He said to me, “I will take your son Muhammed, who goes to school. First I will shoot him in the head, then I will shoot you.” For that reason I felt compelled and accepted.

Presiding Judge : And during this time you did not see Enes?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : You did not see Muhammed Emre, Eren, or anyone at all?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see anyone.

Presiding Judge : Okay, after you made this plan, was Narin wrapped in a blanket when you saw her?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Where did you get the blanket?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Salim went and brought the blanket; I do not know from where he brought it.

Presiding Judge : Did he go and bring it from another room?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : It was not in the room, that is, it was in the car.

Presiding Judge : So did Salim go outside the house or go to another room?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, he went out like that.

Presiding Judge : He went outside the house and brought the blanket, is that so? Narin was lying on the floor, correct?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : You did not hear any sound inside the house? You did not see anyone. Okay, after wrapping with the blanket, what did you do?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : After wrapping with the blanket, I slowly brought her home. I brought her to the barn of our house. There we put her into a sack. There I went to the car. He also came by car, he came next to our car.

Presiding Judge : One moment, did you take the body with the blanket?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I placed it inside the blanket and took it.

Presiding Judge : Where did you take it in the blanket?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I took it next to the car.

Presiding Judge : Where was your car?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : In front of the door.

Presiding Judge : In front of your door. Then did no one see this at that time?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, no one saw.

Presiding Judge : No one saw. You took the blanket in your arms. You took it to your own car. You took it to your red car with plate 23 AN, correct?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : During this time, no one in the vicinity saw?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Where was Yüksel?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : At that time, when I put Narin into the car, I lifted my head. I saw she was up above, crying.

Presiding Judge : Where was she crying?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : On the hill.

Presiding Judge : Now after you took her from the house, after you wrapped Narin in the blanket, after wrapping in the blanket, where did Salim go?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : After I went down, he also came down by car.

Presiding Judge : Now you went out with the blanket.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I went out.

Presiding Judge : After you left Arif’s house, where did you go first? Did you go to the barn?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I took her to the barn.

Presiding Judge : Whose barn is this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It was our barn.

Presiding Judge : Your barn. Why did you take her to the barn?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I put her into a sack there.

Presiding Judge : How did this come to mind?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I put her into a sack.

Presiding Judge : Why did you not take her with the blanket but thought to put her into a sack? Did this occur to you? Did you think of it? Did it occur to you? Did Salim tell you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I thought of it.

Presiding Judge : So Salim handed her to you in the blanket and told you to dispose of it.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : After that, in the planning, Salim had nothing to do with it. You planned it, is that so?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : I could not comprehend how you thought to put her into a sack, that as well.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I took her to the barn. Our sack was there. Let me put her into the sack.

Presiding Judge : At that time did the girl Narin have clothes on her? On her person? Was she naked or clothed?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : She had clothes.

Presiding Judge : Do you remember the clothes?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : There was a black T-shirt.

Presiding Judge : Do you remember her bag, etc.?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Presiding Judge : You do not remember. You put her into the sack. "When I took the corpse in my arms and left the residence, I also, upon Salim’s instruction, took the slippers belonging to Narin that were in front of the door and put them inside the blanket."

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : "And I went down toward my residence to place it in my vehicle."

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : "First I placed the corpse through the window into the barn belonging to me."

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : "Then I passed the sack over the head of the corpse in the barn. I hastily passed the sack over the head of the corpse but I had not tied the sack. Then I left the corpse on the floor mat area of the back seat of my own vehicle."

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : What did you do with the blanket?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Salim came for the blanket, he came by car. He came by car and took the blanket from me. Then they went downwards. I do not know which direction he went after that.

Presiding Judge : Now did Salim come to your barn by car?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, no. He came to the front of the door, next to the car.

Presiding Judge : Now one moment, I will start from the beginning. You went to the barn, you put her into the sack. Where did you leave the blanket?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I took the blanket next to the car.

Presiding Judge : You took the blanket together with the sack as well?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : Okay. Was the blanket wet?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Now, there is a DNA that came up in Salim’s car. There was foam at her mouth. Now if the blanket was wet, could the foam or saliva or something else coming from her mouth have contaminated the blanket, and upon taking the blanket it might have transferred to Salim? In other words, was there any wetness on the blanket?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not notice at all.

Presiding Judge : You did not pay attention; you do not know. Then you came to your own house. You came with the blanket and the sack. Who stays in your house? Your spouse?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : My spouse was staying.

Presiding Judge : Do your mother and father reside with you?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Where was your spouse at that time?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : My mother was inside the house.

Presiding Judge : Your spouse?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : My spouse was inside as well.

Presiding Judge : But they were not outside?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : Then you placed the sack in your car. We will now say sack; the corpse, Narin, is inside the sack. Where in your car did you place the sack?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had placed it on the back seats of the car.

Presiding Judge : On the back seat of the car? You placed it on the floor mat area, is that so?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : Okay. Did Salim come to you at that time?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Salim came.

Presiding Judge : What did Salim say to you?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : He told me, take it. We call it the lake.

Presiding Judge : Okay, we call it the lake. To the lake?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Take it there, throw it in pieces. Let no one see. Then I took it there. I did not interfere at all. I mean I did not interfere with the corpse; I left the corpse there.

Presiding Judge : You left the sack. Mr. Arif, could we be a bit calmer? Mr. Arif, there is a restroom on the side. We can take you there to wash your face if you like. Let us take him to the restroom. Okay. You took it there and somehow threw the sack, is that so?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I left it there.

Presiding Judge : Well, did you tell Salim the place where you left it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Then later that evening at 22:47 Salim goes to the place where the sack, the corpse, was found. How does Salim know that place?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : It is visible from above.

Presiding Judge : That is the place you call the lake, right?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, the lake.

Presiding Judge : After this incident, after you threw it into the lake, did you speak with Salim and say something like I handled it, it is done?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Then did Salim ask you whether this matter was done?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, we did not meet at all.

Presiding Judge : You did not speak afterward?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : We did not speak.

Presiding Judge : You did not tell Salim where you put it, like I put it under this tree, I put a stone, etc.? Then did Salim, on his own initiative, go at night to that stream where it was found and observe the sack?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know that. The first time I took it there, it is visible from the side of the house.

Presiding Judge : He may have seen your car. Now during this search, this incident occurred. These occurred on 21.08. Subsequently, a missing person report for Narin was made, correct?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : After the missing person report was made, did you have any conversation or meeting with Salim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : So after this incident did Salim not tell you to keep your mouth shut, keep quiet, do not tell anyone anything?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : You did not speak at all after this incident?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Only once he came to my mother’s courtyard. There was a well there, an old well. He had come there with the gendarmes. I spoke with him there. I had no other conversation.

Presiding Judge : You had no conversation. Then why did you not come and tell the truth until the body was found, and only felt the need to speak after the body was found?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was afraid.

Presiding Judge : Whom were you afraid of? You are a stranger in this village, are you not? That is, is this the Güran Family’s village, or is it your own village?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : It is their village.

Presiding Judge : You are someone who came from outside and is staying in the village, correct?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : You stated that at that moment, when I looked upward, that is toward Arif Güran’s house, I saw Yüksel Güran looking while crying with her face in her hands. So you saw from the window?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I saw by the car.

Presiding Judge : Where by the car did you see? Did you see from the rear-view mirror, did you look back from the car? Or while the car was moving did you see from the side?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : When I put it on top of the car, I closed the door. I looked up; she was crying up above.

Presiding Judge : Before the car moved, while you were in front of your own house, you saw, is that so?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : She was looking from the window, is that so? Yüksel?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. The front of our house is elevated.

Presiding Judge : So had she left the house, or was she inside the house?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : She was not; I do not know that. I saw her on the hill. I did not see her elsewhere.

Presiding Judge : You saw Yüksel not in the house, but in the place where her house’s barn is, on the hill, watching you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : That is correct.

Presiding Judge : You do not know how she got there. Did you see Enes during this time?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : You have no idea regarding Enes?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Well then, if we ask the same question again from the beginning, do you know how Narin was killed; that is, whether they killed her by strangling, by stabbing, by administering poison, or by some other possibility?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : When you arrived at the house you knew Narin was dead. In your view, how might Narin have been killed?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know, in my opinion she may have been killed by strangulation; that is what I think.

Presiding Judge : You think that, but did you encounter any bleeding, a knife, anything like that on Narin; was there blood?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : There was not. Then a case was also brought against Enes for intentional killing in participation. According to what you describe, Salim and Yüksel killed her. Where does Enes fit in this?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Presiding Judge : You have no information about Enes. You took the body toward the Eğertutmaz stream, and previously one of Narin’s feet had remained outside the sack. “Because I did it in haste and panic, I could not tie it, and I could not fix this. After leaving the body as I indicated, I left the scene.” Then why did you not dismember the body but placed it whole inside the sack?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I could not do it, I mean my conscience...

Presiding Judge : You could not do that?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I could not.

Presiding Judge : Then while placing it inside the sack, so that the sack would flow away from that lake — after all, the sack might move, the water could carry it away — did you secure it with stones so that the water would not carry it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I left only one stone.

Presiding Judge : Why did you leave that stone?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I left that stone, I did it so that it would go under the water.

Presiding Judge : But rather than making it go under the water, if you had thrown that sack directly into the water and the water had carried it away, was that not the instruction given to you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : You did this on your own initiative, correct? As for Salim — is there any possibility that he told you to put it on a stone so it would stay there?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Because at later stages, in Yüksel’s press statements or interviews given to radio or television, there are statements like “Whoever killed her, let them bring her; at least let us know the location of the body.” You must have seen these while searches were being conducted, correct? On television?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Presiding Judge : You do not remember. Then after this incident did Yüksel have any conversation with you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Did Enes have any conversation?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Then only Salim and Yüksel knew that you carried the sack there, is that so?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : And Arif Güran did not know either, is that so?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : Then let me ask these and move to other matters. Now, in Salim’s statements — in his first statements — he claims he was doing field work, then went home, that he was not at the locations in question. Later, after this incident, he again goes to the field. Do you know what Salim did after this incident?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : What did you do after you left the body in the field?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : After leaving it, I went to my sister-in-law’s house.

Presiding Judge : You went to your sister-in-law Zeynep’s house, okay.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : She had prepared cheese for us; I took the cheese and went home.

Presiding Judge : Now Nevzat, the matters you describe — to find the right phrasing... you are describing them very coolly. Now you say you saw a corpse for the first time in your life, correct? You say, “I saw the body, I did not know what to do, therefore I could not dismember it,” but after leaving the body there, you continue your life as if nothing had happened.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : These two are very difficult. Are you seeing a corpse for the first time in your life?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : You have the right not to answer this question — have you ever killed someone before in your life?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : You saw a corpse for the first time in your life, you disposed of that corpse, and then, as if nothing had happened, you went to get cheese from your sister-in-law, is that so?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : I am asking repeatedly because we are extracting words with tweezers; since we are extracting words with tweezers, so that they are properly recorded in the minutes. Friends, pay attention to the questions I ask so that you too may ask the same questions — it is your right — but as far as possible when asking the same question, please be mindful of this. Apart from “throw it into the stream, dismember it,” did you have any other meeting or conversation with Salim, did you provide him with any information at all?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Until you yourself sought effective remorse — rather, let us not call this effective remorse — until you confessed, you did not speak with anyone on this matter, is that so?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : That is so.

Presiding Judge : You decided by yourself to confess as well, is that so? Why did you confess?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : My conscience.

Presiding Judge : In any case, let us say your conscience did not accept. We do not know what Salim did with the blanket. No message came to you in prison; like “accept the murder, change your statements,” there was no such message, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : Your brother said on this matter, “A message was sent to my elder brother by Ali Rıza; let Nevzat accept all the blame, we will give him a car and a field.” Did such a request come to you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It did.

Presiding Judge : You said no.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, now an offer came — my brother said there is such an offer — but they did not come and tell me.

Presiding Judge : I see, so no one came and made such an offer to you, but your brother came and said “Brother, there is such an offer.” Then did any message come to you from your spouse?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : None came.

Presiding Judge : You have the right not to answer this question; Arif Güran alleges that Salim had a relationship with your spouse. There is such a press statement. There are also some reports that you are slandering. Is such a thing true?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not say such a thing; I did not see it with my own eyes.

Presiding Judge : You do not know. Are you slandering the Arif Güran family, Salim, or the Güran family?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Is there any enmity between you?
  
Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : They say this: In the objection to detention by Salim Güran’s attorney, there is the following claim: “Nevzat was giving money; again on the day of the incident he gave money to Narin; he accustomed Narin to himself and on the day of the incident he killed Narin; he had been planning this 3–4 days in advance. For this reason he was giving money to the children.” What do you say about this allegation?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Were you giving money to the child?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not.

Presiding Judge : Again, the defense attorneys of the defendants say that after leaving school, for Narin to go to her own house she had to pass in front of your house or in front of your barn; is that correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It is a bit farther; there is a distance of 30–40 meters.

Presiding Judge : So after passing that path, in order for her to reach her own house, does she need to pass in front of your house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Even if she passed from another place, then it would be very far. The nearest — that is, the distance is there; she passed from there.

Presiding Judge : Well then, were you under any plan at that time; now, let me say this — I am speaking of the objections in the objection petition of the defendants’ counsel; this is not the court’s acceptance. Let there be no misunderstanding on this matter; I am reading the objection petition in the detention objection of the defendants’ counsel, okay? Now they claim this: that your mother heard that all the men of the Güran family were out of the village to distribute invitations, that your mother heard this and told you, and upon this you made a plan to kill Narin; on the day of the incident you waited for Narin in front of the house, when Narin arrived you took her and killed her.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It is not true.

Presiding Judge : Do you have any enmity with the Güran family?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Are you their worker?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Are you someone engaged in plastering work in the village; do you do it in the village or in the city?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do it in villages.

Presiding Judge : Do you work in the Güran family’s field?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Then there are contradictions among your statements. Is the statement you have given here in court of your own free will to our court correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : These are the clearest statements you have given, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Presiding Judge : In the statements you gave to the prosecutor’s office you told different things because you were afraid, is that so? Salim gave you the slippers, is that so?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Presiding Judge : Did he say anything while giving the slippers?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, he did not say anything.

Presiding Judge : In the sense of “Take these, conceal the evidence,” is that so?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I took them and put them in the sack.

Presiding Judge : Is there anything else we did not ask or forgot? Let us look at our notes; Mr. Prosecutor, do you have anything to ask?


## Trial Prosecutor

Trial Prosecutor : We have questions to ask. Nevzat Bahtiyar, just now in your statement before the court you said that Salim frightened you with a firearm.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Trial Prosecutor : Between 15:27 and 15:35 on the day of the incident, the four of you are in the same place; I am referring to our own base station data. Was it during this period that he threatened you? Did he have a firearm with him? Where did this threat with the firearm occur?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He had a firearm with him; he drew it.

Trial Prosecutor : What did he do after drawing it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He threatened me with the firearm: “You will dispose of this corpse; otherwise I will take your son and then call you, and in front of your eyes I will shoot him in the head. Then I will shoot you in the head.” He made such a threat to me; I was compelled.

Trial Prosecutor : So he did this with the firearm he had with him?

Presiding Judge : Mr. Prosecutor, my apologies. Then according to your allegation Salim sees Enes during a sexual intercourse; therefore, what was Salim’s attire at that time?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Presiding Judge : Was it clothing hastily put on?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Presiding Judge : Was there any sweat due to the incident or anything that caught your attention?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not pay any attention.

Presiding Judge : Was he as composed as you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Trial Prosecutor : In the WhatsApp logs retrieved for Salim Güran there is a 41-second call from you at 17:46; 9779 is your number, is it not? There is a 41-second call from this number; I am speaking of 17:46. You took her to the stream and handled the matter, did you not? What did you discuss in this call?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not speak at all.

Presiding Judge : There is a 41-second call.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not speak at all.

Trial Prosecutor : Okay, at 22:44 in the evening Salim goes to the place where our girl Narin’s lifeless body was found, by giving some information and from the camera footage. You mention a single stone or 2–3 stones, correct? There are additional twigs and brush left on the body; could Salim Güran have done this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no idea; I did not see.

Presiding Judge : Why did you call on WhatsApp? I am missing that.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not call anyone.

Presiding Judge : You use the number the prosecutor mentioned, do you not?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Normally I called him once.

Presiding Judge : In the information provided, in the WhatsApp history it has been determined that you called Salim at 17:46 at the time in question.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I never called; I do not know.

Presiding Judge : At that time had you gone to your sister-in-law for cheese?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was in Çarıklı at 17:30.

Trial Prosecutor : On the day of the incident, you say again that you carried Narin in your arms to the stream, correct? Into a sack, you put her into the sack, you did not tie the mouth of the sack with a rope. You walked toward the stream. In August, in the heat of August, you walked toward the stream. A 25-kilogram girl — were you alone?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was alone.

Trial Prosecutor : Salim was not with you; you walked. You looked for a rope; where did you find a rope there?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had cut the strap of the bag; I tied it with that.

Trial Prosecutor : How did you trust going without taking a rope? Where would you find a rope there among the stones and gravel?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : At that moment a rope did not cross my mind at all.

Presiding Judge : Yes, Mr. Nahit, please.


## Diyarbakır Bar Association

### Law. Nahit Eren

Law. Nahit Eren : If we could have silence...

Presiding Judge : Yes, silence please. Could everyone be seated?

Law. Nahit Eren : Your Honor, before moving to the question, of course we are discussing evidence here. I will say only one sentence. First of all, your decision to accept the Diyarbakır Bar Association’s request to join was meaningful and valuable for this case file. We have been following the case file since the first day. And today, all of us have taken our place in this trial to bring out the material truth. I will begin asking my questions to Nevzat. Nevzat, how long have you known Salim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Well... 30 years, there are 30 years. It may be more because we have been together since childhood.

Law. Nahit Eren : You were very close friends.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, correct.

Law. Nahit Eren : You meet constantly.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Constantly — that is, not constantly. I mean... when we had time he would call me, I would call him. We would go to the coffeehouse.

Law. Nahit Eren : For example, where would you meet?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Mostly — that is, we would meet at the coffeehouse. I mean we would also meet in the village.

Law. Nahit Eren : Would you come together in the village and walk on those paths?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. I mean we would make tea and drink it. That is, we would sit.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you ever go to his house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have gone.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you enter the house and be a guest?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have been a guest.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you go any time close to the incident?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : You did not.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : We went once. There... Not on the second day of the incident. I went up. The Gendarmerie was there. Like... I stayed for 15–20 minutes and went down.

Law. Nahit Eren : Alright, let us come to the day of the incident. You said you called Salim at eight past three (15:08) on the day of the incident.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you remember the sentences you spoke when you called Salim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you remember what you discussed?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : What we discussed — I told him to check the water. He said, “Alright, I will call the team. Let the team come and check.”

Law. Nahit Eren : Was it your house’s water that was not running?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. Water was not running in our house.

Law. Nahit Eren : Well, did you make any request to the municipality about this in any way?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no knowledge.

Law. Nahit Eren : In the municipality’s determination reflected in the file there is a minute stating there was no water malfunction at your house. Are you aware of this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no knowledge.

Law. Nahit Eren : Alright, you spoke at 15:08. After you spoke, can you fully describe the direction for us? Your direction of going. You said you went to water the trees.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : Where did you water the trees?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : In the courtyard.

Law. Nahit Eren : You watered in the courtyard in front of where your house is located?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : How many minutes did the watering take?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : From where did you bring the water?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : From my mother’s.

Law. Nahit Eren : Was the hose attached?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The hose was attached.

Law. Nahit Eren : What distance? Between your house and your mother’s?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : About 20 meters.

Law. Nahit Eren : From there to your house there is a hose connected.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. I had connected it. I... As I was coming I connected it. I thought I would water the trees a bit.

Law. Nahit Eren : Could you tell again how many minutes you watered?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : You do not remember. In her statement to the prosecutor, your spouse Gazal says that you called Nevzat — pardon, that you called Salim. Then she says you left the house. He was actually going to water the trees but he did not water the trees.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, there are no trees. I was in the backyard at that time. I had really gone there to the backyard a bit. I was there.

Law. Nahit Eren : The trees in front of the house, or the ones behind the house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The back. The ones at the back. I was there. She did not see me.

Law. Nahit Eren : Alright. You called Nevzat — pardon, you called Salim. Salim told you these things. After you talked with Salim, did you go toward Arif’s house or toward Salim’s house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I went toward Arif’s house.

Law. Nahit Eren : You went toward Arif’s house. The HTS records say you went toward between Arif’s and Salim’s houses.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. I did not go that way.

Law. Nahit Eren : You did not go toward Salim’s house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : Well, the first time you went, how long did Salim have contact with you outside?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Since you spoke with Salim on the phone that day, did you have any intention to come together as usual in the friendship you had, knowing he was at home?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did he come to the garden and call you from above?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : Can you tell us how many minutes after the minute you spoke?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : You do not remember.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : For example, can you say this? I watered such-and-such number of trees or such-and-such an area of vegetables, I changed the water this many times. This would take 2–3 minutes; then Salim called me — can you say that?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I cannot.

Law. Nahit Eren : You cannot. Then did you head directly to the house? Did you head directly to Salim’s house? What did he say to you outside such that you headed to Salim’s house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He...

Law. Nahit Eren : I am asking about the first contact. You say he called out to you. You went. Salim is standing in front of Arif’s house. You made contact with Salim. What did Salim say to you at the first moment? The first moment. Did you greet each other, for example?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : What did he say to you? Well, you are talking about a 30-year friendship. Regarding entering inside, entering together with Salim — because Arif has a statement: he said Nevzat had never in his life entered Arif’s house. Have you ever previously entered Arif’s house in your life? Unrelated to this incident.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have gone once.

Law. Nahit Eren : When?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you not remember why you went? For example, the year.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember. I went once but I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : You went; Salim is there. You made contact. Without saying what he said, you headed toward the house.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : After I went there I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : I am not asking about Narin. From the moment you made contact with Salim, I am talking about the time until you entered the house. You did not speak; he said “Let us enter the house.” You entered together without questioning anything?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : You entered the house. Were there shoes in front of the door?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Were there old shoes? I will ask shortly so let me ask now. You took the slippers from in front of the door and put them into the blanket — when you took them, were there other shoes?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Were there old ones? That is, in front of the door was there an arrangement of shoes that would show us a crowd inside the house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. It did not catch my attention.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you not remember? Think, think. Bring that moment to your mind’s eye.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I am thinking.

Law. Nahit Eren : What is the distance between Salim’s house and Arif’s house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know that much.

Law. Nahit Eren : But we can see Salim’s house quite easily from Arif’s house, right?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : Was there a vehicle in front of the house? Was there a vehicle?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not look that way at all. That is, it did not catch my attention.

Law. Nahit Eren : But when you walk, when you go to Salim’s door area, when you go toward Arif’s house, you see Salim’s house. A vehicle is a big thing. Something all of us would see. You did not see a vehicle there. A white vehicle belonging to Fuat.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see. I did not see at all.

Law. Nahit Eren : You did not see.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see.

Law. Nahit Eren : Well, did you see any of Salim’s children, his daughters, at that time?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. I did not see. There was no one at that time.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Even if there was, I did not see.

Law. Nahit Eren : You entered inside.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : How many minutes did you stay inside?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : For example, you say “We entered inside”; you tell me all the doors were closed. He took us to a room. You said Narin’s lifeless body was on the floor in the room. Yes. When you saw Narin’s lifeless body, what was your reaction?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : A bit — I saw it. Then I was afraid. I hesitated a bit.

Law. Nahit Eren : What did you say to Salim at that moment? The first thing you said. From the moment you saw Narin. The first sentence you said to Salim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : You spoke, but you do not remember. You spoke, you do not remember. Was there any problem? Did you ask why this girl was on the floor?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not ask.

Law. Nahit Eren : Well, in normal life, if such a thing happened, would you not ask?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : You do not know. Was it because of the friendship between you that you did not ask?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : If Salim did it or whoever did it, if Salim brought you, did you say there must be a truth here? Did you not think anything?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : At that time I did not think anything.

Law. Nahit Eren : You did not think anything?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not think.

Law. Nahit Eren : Alright, you saw. On the floor. Just now when the presiding judge asked, you said he brought the blanket from outside.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He brought it from outside, but I do not know from where he brought it.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did he call anyone?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, he did not call anyone.

Law. Nahit Eren : His children?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see at all.

Law. Nahit Eren : His daughters?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see.

Law. Nahit Eren : His spouse?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see.

Law. Nahit Eren : Enes?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see.

Law. Nahit Eren : How long did it take for the blanket to arrive?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : I will tell you the time you stayed inside the house. That time for us — you enter the house at 15:26. You are inside the house until 15:35. A 9-minute period is normal, is it not? Remember the period you stayed?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Because four minutes later your vehicle appears on the cameras after leaving the house. This is concrete evidence. The moment the red car is captured on camera at :41. From the farm camera. You enter the house at :26. From :26 to :41 you are in that house and around that house. I am talking about the process in that sequence of events you just told the presiding judge. That is, 15 minutes. Did all these happen within those 15 minutes? I will say it again. From inside your house, taking Narin; the blanket arriving; wrapping in the blanket; taking the slippers from the door; and after leaving the house we add the time to hand over the blanket as well. Because you came toward your house. Is it 15 minutes?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember, I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you not remember the time, or do you not want to remember?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember the time.

Law. Nahit Eren : You do not remember the time. Alright, you are inside the house. You took Narin. While Narin was lying on the floor, where was the bag?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The bag was on her neck.

Law. Nahit Eren : The bag was on her neck like that?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It was on her neck.

Law. Nahit Eren : Well, do you remember whether the bag was open or closed?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It was closed.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you then feel the need to look?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : But when you took the slippers when you went outside, did you keep the bag on Narin’s neck in the same way?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I threw the slippers into it.

Law. Nahit Eren : For example, how did you throw them into it? Did you open the blanket again?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : Tell us, for example, show us — you say, for example, the blanket; you say you wrapped it with Salim, right? You wrapped it with Salim; the blanket came from outside. Did you spread the blanket on the floor or did you hold the blanket in your arms?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I held the blanket in my arms.

Law. Nahit Eren : How did Salim assist you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He only took it out of the house.

Law. Nahit Eren : No, no — while wrapping in the blanket, how did Salim assist you? Tell us how you wrapped it.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I held this side of the blanket once.

Law. Nahit Eren : You held it.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He saw me there as well. He turned, turned from the stairs, turned to me.

Law. Nahit Eren : Yes. You two held from one end and placed into the blanket. Did you wrap inside?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : We had not fully wrapped; we had just folded it normally with the slippers.

Law. Nahit Eren : Are the two of you going out together holding it, or are you alone?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The two of us — alone — we went out together.

Law. Nahit Eren : When did he tell you to put the slippers inside as well?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He told me at the door to put the slippers inside.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you think he saw them at that moment or earlier? Did he tell you to put the slippers inside before seeing them at the door, or did he also see the slippers?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He saw them.

Law. Nahit Eren : You looked there. Other than those slippers, did you not see anything else, shoes?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : There were, there were, old ones.

Law. Nahit Eren : How many, for example?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : For small children or big ones? Pardon, for adults? For a girl or a boy? Were the shoes standing in front of the door like that, sports shoes?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : You do not remember. Alright. You took Narin from there — did Salim then come outside or did he go back inside again?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : While I was walking there, I do not know, truly, I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : But let me remind you of one of your statements. You say, “As I was going toward the vehicle, he came behind me by car.” Is this information correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, after I went down and went next to the car, he came.

Law. Nahit Eren : You took Narin, you are going with her in your arms, you are going toward the house. Because your vehicle is there, your vehicle is there, you are going.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : In your statement you say: “Salim came behind me with his vehicle.” In your earlier statements.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : How did he come? Did he come on foot? That is, did he walk behind you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He came by car.

Law. Nahit Eren : That is what I am asking. With which car? The white car standing in front of the house. It was standing in front of the house. You saw it when you went out. Then if the vehicle in front of Salim’s house moved, by which way would it come next to your car?

Law. Nahit Eren : There are two roads. There is one road.

Law. Nahit Eren : You saw him coming from behind by car. By which road did he come?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He came through the village interior.

Law. Nahit Eren : So not the one toward the school?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The one inside the village.

Law. Nahit Eren : The village, from the back. You exited the house at thirty-six past (15:36).

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Then how long would it take for him to come to you from there?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I truly do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : Normally, for example, how many years have you lived in that village?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I am 52 years old. I have lived in that village for 52 years.

Law. Nahit Eren : Have you ever ridden in Salim’s car before? Not this Renault. In his car that had an accident, for example. Or in earlier years, in his car. How long would it take for him to come from in front of his house to the house you mentioned?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I do not know approximately.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you not have an estimate? Three minutes, five minutes?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I cannot say it definitively.

Law. Nahit Eren : But he came there by car. He came there by car. Why did he turn and come to the front of your house? How did he turn his direction toward your vehicle?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He did not turn. He came and stopped there.

Law. Nahit Eren : Then would the camera in front of the school not see him?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It would not.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did he enter from the turnoff to your house before reaching the place where Narin was last seen?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. He came from the mosque side.

Law. Nahit Eren : On which side is the road to your house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It is on the upper side.

Law. Nahit Eren : The left. When we face the school, it is on the left.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, the left.

Law. Nahit Eren : He came — before reaching the school, did Salim’s vehicle turn toward your house? Not on the school side.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He came from the mosque side.

Law. Nahit Eren : No, no. He is not going toward the school either. Did he turn from the mosque and come toward your house? Did he come from the back?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He came from the back.

Law. Nahit Eren : Alright. And you handed the blanket over to him there.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : Was Ramazan Atasoy there?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : Was Mehmet Selim Atasoy there?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, no one saw.

Law. Nahit Eren : They did not get in the car with you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : When you took Narin?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I was alone.

Law. Nahit Eren : You handed the blanket to Salim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : You handled the blanket for a long time, did you not? For example, tell us about the blanket. What was its color? What was its shape? Did it have a pattern on it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : At that time, I mean, I do not remember much.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you remember the clothes Salim was wearing?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : There was a T-shirt.

Law. Nahit Eren : What color was it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember the color.

Law. Nahit Eren : The blanket is larger than that T-shirt. Do you not remember the color?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember the color at the moment.

Law. Nahit Eren : You looked at it at length, you placed Narin inside it, you folded it. You came and, from the ceiling of your house above, you lowered it down, from the window. You still have the blanket. That is your assertion. You still have the blanket.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had left the blanket next to the car. After he came, I took it to him.

Law. Nahit Eren : No, no — you took Narin upstairs, you took her into your house, as you told the Presiding Judge, you said you passed the sack down over her head. You lowered her from above. What did you do with the blanket?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I took the blanket next to the car.

Law. Nahit Eren : No, no — upstairs, upstairs. You did not take Narin in front of your house without the blanket. You did not take her to the barn. You have the blanket, Narin is inside. You lowered Narin into the barn from the window. What did you do with the blanket? Let me state that moment. But where is the blanket?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I took the blanket, together with the body, next to the car.

Law. Nahit Eren : No, you lowered the body down from upstairs — because as far as I understand, there is a sort of chute in your barn upstairs.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : You threw Narin down through that chute.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I lowered her slowly.

Law. Nahit Eren : So you lowered her slowly. Then did you lower her down together with the blanket?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : That is what I am asking. You lowered her down together with the blanket. You went down, went to the barn, put her into the sack. You did not tie the mouth of the sack. How did you carry the sack? On your shoulder, on your back, in your arms, under your arm?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The blanket. I carried her with the blanket.

Law. Nahit Eren : With the blanket in your hand. You came to the vehicle. You saw Salim coming from behind with the vehicle.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I threw the body into the car. Salim had just arrived then.

Law. Nahit Eren : You placed Narin into the vehicle.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : At that moment you did not leave the blanket inside the vehicle?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not leave it.

Law. Nahit Eren : You are still holding it in your arms.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I had left it next to the car.

Law. Nahit Eren : Well then, did you know Salim would come such that you left it outside? If you did not know, for example, you had taken on a responsibility to dispose of Narin, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Law. Nahit Eren : That is how you state it. If you put Narin inside the vehicle, if you did not know Salim would come, would a person leave a piece of criminal evidence like a blanket next to the vehicle?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : They would not, but I knew he would come.

Law. Nahit Eren : How did you know? Did he tell you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He did not tell me; I mean, I assumed. I knew he would come for the blanket.

Law. Nahit Eren : While you were there, in the house, did he tell you he would take the blanket from you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He did not say so. I knew he would come.

Law. Nahit Eren : Then did you think he would come at that moment, or that he would come to the location, that is, to Eğertutmaz Stream where you went?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not think of that.

Law. Nahit Eren : You had a feeling that he would come directly to the front of the house. Where did you get this feeling? For example, I am asking this with a comment — with a comment together with a question, Your Honor. After I hand over a body to someone, I would not make contact anymore thinking I have rid myself of that body. Could it not be that Salim had such a feeling when he handed it to you? Or if not, then in some way, directly or indirectly, he must have made you feel that he would come to you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : He came, you put it down at that moment. Salim came; Narin is in the sack, in the car, on the floor mat area of the back seat. Did Salim ask you where you put it? Did he ask what you put it into?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, he did not. We did not have such a conversation.

Law. Nahit Eren : At that moment did he not ask where in the car it was?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He did not ask. I had already put it into the car.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you think he saw it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He did not see that I put it into the car at that time.

Law. Nahit Eren : He did not see?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He did not see. That is, he took the blanket next to the car, he took the blanket from me and took it away. I do not know anything else.

Law. Nahit Eren : In your opinion — he is your friend of 30 years — what might Salim have done with that blanket?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you think he gave it to someone, like you did?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : Could he have given it to Ramazan?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : Could he have given it to Mehmet Selim Atasoy?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : You have no information on this.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.

Law. Nahit Eren : You went, you took, you went to the stream. At that moment at the stream — I also watched your videos. That is, together with our prosecutors, I watched the video at the scene where you placed Narin into that puddle of water. I will ask you something. At that moment what was the level of the water down below? I am asking about the water flowing from Eğertutmaz stream. Was the water of Eğertutmaz overflowing toward the place where you buried her, or was there no water there? Because I am not speaking of the water here. Because you — let me explain to you — when you went for evidence determination, pardon, for site inspection, when Narin was found there was water in the pit where Narin was found. But when you went, apart from that water, you know there is an earthen part between that small area and the stream bed where the water flows. Was that under water?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : That part was not under water.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did your foot, did your foot touch any water?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : There was water there.

Law. Nahit Eren : That is what I am asking. You hid Narin in a small place, in a small hollow. I am saying you placed her there outside, while you are outside. Were your feet in the water at that moment? I am speaking of the water outside that puddle.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : They were in the water.

Law. Nahit Eren : What was the level? From your legs — that is, up to where from your feet?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It was about 50 centimeters. I mean about 40 centimeters.

Law. Nahit Eren : I will ask something. You left the village at 15:41. When we subtract the time you arrived in the neighborhood, I may be mistaken, it is a period of 5–6 minutes. In terms of that period my colleagues can also remind us. I am asking this. We are talking about a period of 38 minutes in this neighborhood. Let us accept each of them as a maximum of 4 minutes — from where you parked the vehicle to where you left Narin. Four there, four back — 8 minutes. What did you do there for 30 minutes? For example, 30 minutes — there is a ready pit there. There is water. You placed her into the water. According to your statements — I say this in quotation marks — you have no effort at camouflage to conceal. Because you said so. For example, you said, “I did not place those branches.”

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not place them.

Law. Nahit Eren : You said, “I placed one stone.” For example, three stones came up. Then at that moment, during that period, because of the height of the water, did you dive into the water, did you take off your clothes and leave them outside? Did you go with shoes and trousers?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, the water was not that high.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you take off your clothes? You did not?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not take them off.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you take off your shoes?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you take off your trousers?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : After how many minutes did you arrive at Zeynep’s house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember that.

Law. Nahit Eren : You left there and directly — cheese. Your spouse tells you, you spoke at 15:08. You are leaving from the house, from the vehicle. She says “Bring cheese from Zeynep’s” when you come in the evening.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : You went to Zeynep’s to get cheese in the evening. After you buried Narin. Where are their house? In Uzunbahçe, right? What is the distance between Uzunbahçe and Eğertutmaz?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : How many kilometers?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know the distance.

Law. Nahit Eren : Have you never gone before?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had gone before but I do not know the distance.

Law. Nahit Eren : How many minutes did it take when you went before?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know, I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : But you went there directly.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, from there — as soon as I left it, from there we said.

Law. Nahit Eren : You went to Zeynep’s house, sat, drank tea; they were eating. They wanted to offer you a meal; you did not accept; you drank tea.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Meal and so on.

Law. Nahit Eren : But you drank tea.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I drank tea.

Law. Nahit Eren : Well, you entered the water. At most half an hour.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not enter the water.

Law. Nahit Eren : You just said that when you placed Narin into that pit the water level was high?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I said it was not high.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did I misunderstand? You seemed to say it was high.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : That is what I said.

Law. Nahit Eren : You said forty–fifty centimeters. Show us forty–fifty centimeters. In your view, how much is forty–fifty centimeters? You went into the water up to your knees.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not go in. I did not enter the water at all.

Law. Nahit Eren : You took off your trousers.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not take off my trousers either; there was a stone there. I said I did not enter the water.

Presiding Judge : He said he did not enter the water. He said he did not remove any clothing. Ask again so we can confirm.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not enter the water at all.

Law. Nahit Eren : The 40–50 centimeter water level — where is that water level? You mentioned a 40–50 centimeter water level. You said it was high.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, that is how I put it.

Law. Nahit Eren : Then did you build a bridge so as not to touch that water? Did you leave her like this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : There was a stone, a stone. There was a stone there.

Law. Nahit Eren : Let us understand each other well, Nevzat. Let us understand well. I will explain again. You went down that slope. You have Narin under your arm. You went down. In your mind, where did you plan to bury her earlier?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Because I deemed that place suitable, I left her there.

Law. Nahit Eren : Where did you think this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I went — there.

Law. Nahit Eren : You left the house. Did you plan a place in your mind after leaving the house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. I did not plan at all.

Law. Nahit Eren : You are a fisherman as well, I think? Am I remembering wrong?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I am not a good fisherman.

Law. Nahit Eren : But you fish there.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. I have never gone there.

Law. Nahit Eren : But you know that stream well.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I know it. I had gone to fish further down.

Law. Nahit Eren : Had you ever gone before to the place where you buried — rather, where you hid — her?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, I had passed by there.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you know there was that pit there? Because it is enclosed. Like a...

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not know before. I went — as there was a pit — I left her there.

Presiding Judge : Now I watched that video as well. When you go to that stream, that is the only place where one can put something, the only place one can descend. Correct? Is that why you descended there?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I deemed that place suitable. I left her there.

Presiding Judge : What was the reason you deemed that place suitable?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I left her there. I mean... I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : I will ask again. Between the place of the pit and the place where the water of Eğertutmaz stream flows — the stream bed — there is an earthen distance. It is green, grassy.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, it is grassy.

Law. Nahit Eren : Weedy. When you went there, were those grasses in the water?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : In the water... I mean no, they were not much in the water.

Law. Nahit Eren : So when you buried — pardon, hid — Narin, you did not get wet at all?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. Only — I mean... I had slippers on my feet.

Law. Nahit Eren : Slippers? Or shoes?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had slippers. Not shoes. Summer slippers.

Law. Nahit Eren : Summer slippers. Were they on your feet all day?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean not all day. When it is hot, I...

Law. Nahit Eren : So you generally walk outside in slippers. That is, you did not put on slippers because you were going to Eğertutmaz in this incident.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : Alright. But your trousers did not get wet. You pulled them up.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. They did not get wet at all. Yes. I did not enter the water.

Law. Nahit Eren : You waited there for thirty-eight minutes.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : In 38 minutes — again I am speaking based on your statements — let me tell you the time you lost with the leg of Narin. Second, the allegations in that sense are correct — you tried to tie the mouth of the sack with the lace of Narin’s red bag. I know you were there for 38 minutes. The court knows too. Because there is undisputed digital material. Your vehicle comes, stops, you go, you get in. These are ascertained. 38 minutes. Know it as well. 38 minutes. In 38 minutes, while you were hiding Narin there, you left her even though you saw that her leg remained outside.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I left it.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you not say — it will remain outside, a living creature will come, pull it, catch the scent, bring it out. My apologies, Mr. Arif. Did such a feeling not develop in you? You live in a village, you are a farmer, you know there are many animals in your village, there are dogs. There are many, are there not, stray dogs?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not think at all.

Law. Nahit Eren : Let me ask something. Do you think later someone went there and might have opened the bag you tied properly — the sack you tied properly?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you think Ramazan might have gone there?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.

Law. Nahit Eren : Mehmet Selim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : Salim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : They did not go?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I mean, they may have gone. I did not see.

Law. Nahit Eren : Why are there three stones, in your opinion?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : You placed one stone, right?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had placed one stone.

Law. Nahit Eren : You placed one stone?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had placed one stone.

Law. Nahit Eren : You did not place brushwood?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : When it was found, there were three stones, there was brushwood. Who knows of that place other than you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : What do you mean?

Law. Nahit Eren : Other than you — who knows that you hid Narin there, other than you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, I...

Law. Nahit Eren : Salim knows?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, Salim knows.

Law. Nahit Eren : But he does not know the exact spot, right?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He does not know the exact spot.

Law. Nahit Eren : He does not know the exact spot. Now let us come — I will ask more explicitly what Madam Prosecutor asked you. The whole Güran family — pardon, not the whole — 6–7 people, I will not list names. After Narin’s disappearance, some on the 22nd, some on the 23rd, deleted all call records on their phones. Do you know what this is?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.

Law. Nahit Eren : No, no — you know what it is, do you not? You know what it is to delete records. Whoever you called, you delete like this.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, I do not know that — I have no information.

Law. Nahit Eren : No, no — you know this technical matter, do you not?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : You do. On Salim’s phone — I am opening it now — all the records he deleted have been restored.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.

Law. Nahit Eren : Those he did not delete are already on his phone; those he deleted have been restored. Especially WhatsApp.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.

Law. Nahit Eren : WhatsApp. It has been restored — this is evidence, concrete evidence, a finding. In the file before us, I am not speaking of the narrowed base station data signed by the experts. Concrete — on Salim’s phone, on his device, they restored all the records, the records he deleted.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.

Law. Nahit Eren : You have no information on this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.

Law. Nahit Eren : At 15:46 you called him — pardon, at 17:46 you called him?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know — I mean I do not know that I called. I only called at 15:08.

Law. Nahit Eren : There is no issue with that — that is a normal call; that has not been deleted. It is on the record, it is on the phone. At 17:46 — look, this is recent; this matter is also in the indictment. At 17 — let me not tell you wrong again. At 17:46 and 32 seconds, you have a 41-second phone call.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : What did he say to you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did he say “Do not call me again”?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I do not know, I mean.

Law. Nahit Eren : Technical, technical — you do not remember.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember, that is.

Law. Nahit Eren : What is Vecdi to you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Vecdi — Vecdi is my brother.

Law. Nahit Eren : Older than you or younger?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Younger than me.

Law. Nahit Eren : Does he have another name among the public? That is, for example, do you have a name you use for Vecdi, other than Vecdi Bahtiyar, within the family, within the village?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Truly — I mean, no. No, it is Vecdi — he has no other name.

Law. Nahit Eren : Then let me give you one more piece of information. Why would Vecdi, your brother, be saved as Vehbi on Salim’s phone? Do you know? Do you know such a name? Pardon me — pardon — as Vedat. As Vedat. Mr. Salim, you also said here that he has another name. Is it Vedat? Is there a name known among everyone as Vedat?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : His name — in the identity — is Vecdi. Normally we say Vedat.

Law. Nahit Eren : That is what I am asking you — Vedat. Vedat was in Hatay that day, you know that, right? For construction work.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : How many times did you speak with Vedat?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : You spoke.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean speaking — I do not know, that is. There may have been a conversation — I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : What did you talk about? You took a child. Let us show a bit of conscience. You took a child to the stream bed. You took an eight-year-old child to the stream bed. You hid her in that pit. What could you talk about with your elder brother? The Presiding Judge asked you. You have not killed anyone in your life.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I spoke with no one. I have not spoken with anyone about this.

Law. Nahit Eren : What did you talk about with Vecdi? I am asking. Vecdi — you called Vecdi.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know — I mean even if I spoke with him, I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Vecdi called you at 06:34 on the morning Narin was found.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did he call or not?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : At 06:34 in the morning. After Vecdi returned from Hatay — his house is in Çarıklı, in Çarıklı, right?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : He stays at his house in Çarıklı. From his house in Çarıklı is Eğertutmaz stream visible? Think — I do not know either.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It is not visible.

Law. Nahit Eren : But he called you at 06:34.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know, I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Did you ever hear what time the search for Narin started there?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : When you looked from your own house did you see it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see at all.

Law. Nahit Eren : Vecdi did not call you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not call.

Law. Nahit Eren : Vecdi did not call you at 06:34?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : I am asking for the last time.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He may have called, I mean, maybe — I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : How is the relationship between Vecdi and Salim?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Their relationship — I mean it was normal.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do they have a relationship like the one you have with him? Are they friends? Companions?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Friends — I mean normal, they grew up together in the village, like two people, like that.

Law. Nahit Eren : I will tell you one more concrete piece of evidence. You call Salim at 17:46. You call him — I am speaking according to the records, according to base station records you call him. And then, setting aside Narin’s matter, according to your friendship you never call Salim again in any way. Salim does not call you either. Let me ask you a question. Salim denies all your claims, does he not? You must have heard.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He denies them.

Law. Nahit Eren : I will ask you a question. I will ask this to Salim as well. Someone you are this close with, someone who is your friend. If truly what you say is “not true,” as Salim says — in quotation marks — how many times would he call you saying “Narin is missing”? He would call and say “Let us search together,” right?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : Suppose someone really abducted Narin that day. That white vehicle they mention, spinning its wheels. Abducts her from the village.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : We already searched in the village.

Law. Nahit Eren : No, no, I am not talking about searching for Narin. For example, I came and abducted Narin. I took her from the village, I abducted Narin. Under normal circumstances would Salim not say to you, “Hey Nevzat, they abducted my niece in the village, come on”? He would call you, would he not?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, he would call.

Law. Nahit Eren : You would search together. You would call every day.

Presiding Judge : One moment, I think there is an objection to the question. Go ahead.

Defense Counsel : We think there is insistent leading in this question. It was asked twice — “he would call, right?”

Presiding Judge : Then let us ask whether he would call in the ordinary course of your daily life.

Law. Nahit Eren : Of course, that is what I asked.

Presiding Judge : Would he call in the ordinary course of your daily life?

Law. Nahit Eren : I abducted her. Under normal circumstances, if someone from outside had abducted Narin, your 30-year friend, someone at whose house you stayed — because of this abduction, aside from family members with whom he would be most in contact, you would be the person. That is what I am asking, right?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, it is not only me he knows — everything in the village is the same.

Law. Nahit Eren : But you have that relationship.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean everyone in the village is the same way. I am not the only one.

Law. Nahit Eren : Is it normal that he never called you even once? In your opinion?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : No, not “I do not remember.” I am asking another opinion question. Under normal circumstances, for missing Narin to be found, Salim should be calling you constantly, right? Because you are his close friend — that is what I am asking.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He should be calling constantly.

Presiding Judge : Let us not ask opinion questions.

Law. Nahit Eren : Not an opinion — because now I will ask about a piece of evidence.

Presiding Judge : Alright, let us ask about evidence.

Law. Nahit Eren : He never called you. He never made contact with you. Do you think he would make contact with Vecdi?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not think so.

Law. Nahit Eren : You do not think so. On 22.08.2024, the day after Narin was found — 10:21; 22.08.2024, 17:02; 22.08.2024, 22:41; 23.08.2024, 12:32 — Vecdi spoke with Salim 4 times, and what a coincidence, in all calls it was Vecdi who called. Do you think they have a relationship?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean he may have called him because of the girl. After she went missing.

Law. Nahit Eren : In all of them he calls you beforehand as well.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : The information he got from you — the information he got from you — are you communicating through Vecdi? There is sequential calling.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : Do you know what sequential calling is? I call you. Ten minutes later, an hour later, I call Mr. Aydın. Was Vecdi your bridge communication?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, nothing like that.

Law. Nahit Eren : He was not.

Law. Nahit Eren : Is Fadile your daughter?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Nahit Eren : Have you ever talked about this incident with Fadile?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have never talked.

Law. Nahit Eren : Have you ever heard the statements given by Fadile?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have never heard.

Law. Nahit Eren : Have you read the statements in this file?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Nahit Eren : Who said what?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have never read. I have no information.

Law. Nahit Eren : For example, Enes says about you: “He is a very insignificant person, very quiet, very open to being led. If Salim tells him to do something, he will do it,” a sentence like that.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : We were friends.

Law. Nahit Eren : So this information is true. Everyone in the village knows you like this.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, in the village we loved each other. I mean Salim.

Law. Nahit Eren : After confirming this, I will tell you your daughter’s statement. You have never heard your daughter’s statement.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I have never heard.

Law. Nahit Eren : Yüksel, Narin’s mother — from the moment she “learned” Narin had gone missing, in her own statement, she heads toward your house and says the following: “Wherever you left my daughter, whoever took my daughter, bring her and leave her in a corner. At least let there be a grave.” In those 19 days — since you were out during those 19 days — did she say anything like this to you on the day Narin went missing?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : She did not. But there were constant conversations in the village. Going to your house — I do not know that.

Law. Nahit Eren : You do not know this information; your daughter did not tell you this in any way within those 19 days?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember, I do not know. All the villages were talking about this matter. Whoever took her, let them bring and leave her somewhere. There was such talk, but I do not know.

Law. Nahit Eren : Your Honor, let me check, one moment.

Presiding Judge : Of course. This is turning into repetitive questioning, but there is nothing to do. We struggle while taking statements; therefore we will at least continue with repetitive questions regarding Nevzat. But let us be careful about repetitive questions regarding Salim or the others — I asked half of them too but we are getting nothing, or “I remember,” “I do not remember.” Look at your notes, Mr. President; otherwise let us give the floor to the next colleagues.

Law. Nahit Eren : Your Honor, that is all my questions to Nevzat for now.

Presiding Judge : Alright, is there anyone who wishes to ask questions from you?

Law. Nahit Eren : Pardon, Your Honor — on this matter, I apologize, I am very sorry, because I was present at the autopsy, I will ask something. I apologize, my colleagues perhaps cannot describe it — before we began the autopsy procedure, during evidence determination, a hook was found inside the sack. Jet-black with a metal-wood appearance, and since it remained in the stream bed, its nature was also reflected in the forensic medicine report. Do you have such a hook — because that sack is yours. From the serial numbers it is clear it matched the fertilizer sacks in your other barn. We are certain on this. In that sack, when you took that sack, were the sacks stacked or was there something inside at some place?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I — something inside — I do not know, I do not remember.

Law. Nahit Eren : Because there was a piece of metal that did not belong to Narin either?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

### Law. Aydın Özdemir

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Mr. Nevzat, did you strangle Narin?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Then who strangled her?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Salim.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Salim — how do you know?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He told me himself.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Did he say he strangled her himself, or did he say someone strangled her — take and hide her?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He said: “I strangled her.”

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Did he ever explain how he strangled her? Did you ask?

Presiding Judge : We asked these, but everything is from scratch.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : It will not be from scratch.

Presiding Judge : You will bring it to a point, tie it together; I understand, but at least refer to our statements — “Look, you said such and such, alright?” Please introduce the topic.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Who threatened you with a gun? In the first section when the presiding judge asked you a question, you said, “They threatened me with a gun.”

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Salim.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : No, I am asking this: “I was afraid, they threatened me with a gun, so I did not give a statement.” At that point you did not give a name.

Trial Prosecutor : Counsel, I asked that. He said he threatened him with a gun at the house.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Again Salim, alright. Who offered money to your brother? Your brother came to the prison and told you, “They offered me money and land.” Who offered this to your brother?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I do not know from whom my brother learned it.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Did he not tell you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He told me. When he came to visit me. He said such a phrase to me, but—

Law. Aydın Özdemir : What did they offer?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He said — let him come and talk to — there was Hacı Hasan. Probably Salim’s uncle — he had said to him.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Which uncle?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Hacı Rıza Güran.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : What did he say?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know what they said.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Of course, of course.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He told Hacı Hasan: “Go tell him — if he wants, let us give such an amount of money, a piece of land; then let us make his house good.” They said something like that — I do not know.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Your brother told this to you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, our brother.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : And Rıza Güran offered it to him through intermediaries?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : I am asking what he told you. Alright. Do you have any enmity with Arif Güran?

Presiding Judge : We asked this question, Counsel. Please, please. Bring it directly to that point — there was no enmity between you.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : I will state it immediately.

Presiding Judge : Look, let us do this — in your earlier statement you said “There was no enmity between us,” ask your question.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Alright, Your Honor.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : So, the family has a claim about Nevzat as follows: “Previously we called Nevzat a stutterer; because he is a stutterer we made fun of him over his stutter, and therefore he killed our daughter,” a claim like that. Did anyone make fun of you like this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Well, before this incident — that is, before Narin’s incident, before the day of the incident — did Salim ever say to you, “I will kill Narin”?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : On the day Salim was arrested — do you know Süveyla Özkan?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I know.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Did Süveyla Özkan say to your spouse and your family, “Salim has been arrested; they will arrest Nevzat as well”?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Was there such a statement with your spouse?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Did you talk with your spouse about this incident? Did you give no information after the incident?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Did you take the body there alone? Well, it has been determined that one leg of the body was severed, or that it was torn by animals.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : In your first statement you said, “At first Salim told me to cut up the body.” Did you ever cut up the body?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not touch it at all.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : Was the leg severed?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember — I mean the leg was not severed or anything.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : You do not remember.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean the leg was not severed.

Law. Aydın Özdemir : It was not severed.

[It was heard that the Complainant Arif Güran spoke loudly and said certain words.]

Presiding Judge : Mr. Arif, please. Let someone take you to the restroom. Give him water. Mr. Arif, can you hear me? Alright. Please be a bit calmer. What is this man saying to me? I understand — please, I say. Get some water and splash your face.

### Law. Erdem Kaya

Law. Erdem Kaya : Do you know Ramazan Ayla?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Ramazan Ayla — Ramazan Ayla is our son-in-law.

Law. Erdem Kaya : Yes, he lives in Istanbul.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Ramazan Ayla — no, he lives in Diyarbakır.

Law. Erdem Kaya : Now, the day after the incident, on August 22, you called three times. On August 23, you called twice. Do you speak this frequently every day?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Truly, I mean on this matter he was calling me. Has the girl been found, I mean what happened?

Law. Erdem Kaya : When you called, was he in Istanbul? Or in Diyarbakır?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : In Istanbul. I do not remember in Diyarbakır. He called me — he called regarding Narin. I mean, did you find her, what happened? I mean, is there news or not? He called me on that matter.

### Law. Asya Cemre Işık

Law. Asya Cemre Işık : In one of your earlier statements, Nevzat, you said, “When I first saw Narin there was blood behind her ear.” Can you tell us this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It was not blood. There was a bruise or something. It was either on the left or the right. There was a bruise — there was no blood.

Law. Asya Cemre Işık : Why did you say blood then?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It had turned red.

Presiding Judge : If the Diyarbakır Bar Association is finished, I give the floor to the counsel for Arif Güran.


## Counsel for the complainant Arif Güran

### Law. Berat Kocakaya

Law. Berat Kocakaya : Did you have any business dealings with Arif Güran?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : Did you ever engage in a car trade?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not buy, that is.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : Was there any talk of money between you regarding a car? Or were you offered money by someone else due to a vehicle transaction? Did you experience any problem in a business dealing?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No problem. We only had an issue with one car.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : So that means you did business before.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : At that time I did not do any.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : Can you explain that vehicle? The one with the issue?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The Antakya car. I bought it. It stayed with me for 1–2 months. A problem arose with the registration. Because of the registration I took it back and said I would return the car there. They returned it to the man; there, together with Arif, they sold the car. They sold the car, but we did not know the car was in parts. The chassis number was different, the panels all different. Because of that the man bought it— a friend had bought that car. He had an accident, the man had an accident. Due to the accident the police came. After the inspection they found the car was in pieces.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : Yes, there was a problem with the car. Well then, did the people you sold it to make any demand of you? From you or from Mr. Arif?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know— they said they issued us an 80,000 lira fine.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : The people to whom you sold it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I paid 50,000 lira.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : You paid 50,000 lira.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I paid 50,000 lira; I was going to pay 20,000 lira more.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : Yes. Because of this 50,000 lira, do you bear any grudge or hostility toward Mr. Arif?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I only spoke with him. He said this phrase to me: he had filed a lawsuit; if he won the case, I would pay the 50,000 lira.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : That is all? You have no other business dealings? And no grudge because of this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Berat Kocakaya : Alright, thank you.


## Ministry of Family and Social Services

### Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : You say you were close friends with Salim Güran. Did you previously know about the relationship between Yüksel Güran and Salim Güran?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : So you learned it that day?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, I learned it that day. I know nothing else.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : But you were very close friends.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, but I know nothing about him.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Well, did Narin see this as a sexual relationship? How did Mr. Salim describe it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know; I have no information about that.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : But he said she saw them while they were having relations, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : He himself said so, but I did not see.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Alright, now you said the last statements taken at the prosecutor’s office are true; however, in the statement dated 21.09.2024 you said, “Her feet did not fit in the sack; I could not tie the mouth of the sack.” Now you say, “I tied the mouth of the sack with the strap of her bag.” Which statement is true?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : While tying the strap, one foot remained outside.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : How could it remain outside?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : After closing it, one foot remained outside. I did not put the foot into the sack. I left it like that.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : So you did not dismember the leg?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : There was no lack of limbs?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : There was a body being carried in the house, talk, threats. Yet according to HTS records Enes and the mother were at home. Did you not hear any noise, argument, conversation in the house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I heard nothing.

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : And you did not see anyone. Well then, had you told Mr. Salim beforehand where you would place the body at Eğertutmaz stream?

Presiding Judge : We asked this too. Anything else?

Law. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Nothing further.

### Law. Abdullah Yılmaz

Law. Abdullah Yılmaz : First, I would like to state this sincerely: it may have been asked, but questions are to reach a final goal, because, sir, everyone can see it— the statements are fragmentary; they change. He constantly fails to remember where he ought to remember.

Presiding Judge : Please proceed quickly.

Law. Abdullah Yılmaz : I wish to say this, sir. I consider this very important: according to HTS base records, Yüksel Güran is at home between 14:28 and 15:38, sir. Nevzat Bahtiyar at 15:41— Mr. Nevzat calls Mr. Salim at 15:08; at 15:27 he is at home.

Presiding Judge : Conclusion? Direct question, Counsel.

Presiding Judge : May I have the question?

Law. Abdullah Yılmaz : The question is this, sir. Because the statements constantly change, we could not draw a conclusion from the HTS records and the statements. The Prosecutor also asked; the President of the Diyarbakır Bar Association also asked, but Salim Güran is at home between 14:52 and 15:19. He goes to the barn, comes and goes constantly; he is at home until 16:10.

Presiding Judge : Counsel, a question— not a defense.

Law. Abdullah Yılmaz : At 17:40 he calls him; at 17:46 he calls Salim back via WhatsApp. It has not been clearly explained, sir.

Presiding Judge : He said “I do not remember; I did not call on WhatsApp.”

Law. Abdullah Yılmaz : And, sir, finally he says “I saw no one at home.” When leaving the house, he says “Ms. Yüksel was crying,” sir; there is a contradiction.

Presiding Judge : Now how can I ask “What did you talk about on WhatsApp?” to a man who says, “I do not remember calling on WhatsApp”?

Law. Abdullah Yılmaz : But sir, the statements keep changing; we will insistently ask.

Presiding Judge : I asked 33 times; he asked 33 times as well. He says he did not call on WhatsApp. To a man who says “I did not call,” I cannot say “What did you talk about on WhatsApp?”

Law. Abdullah Yılmaz : He says there was only Salim Güran at home.

Presiding Judge : I asked— “I do not know where Yüksel came from; I saw her up on the slope.”


## Defense Counsel for Enes Güran

### Law. Mahir Akbilek

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Nevzat Bahtiyar. Although you did not mention Yüksel Güran in your initial knowledge-giving statements and statements given in the capacity of suspect, is the reason you later spoke of Yüksel Güran that you remembered this very important detail on the date you mentioned it? Or is there some other matter you have not shared with the honorable court, with the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, and with law enforcement?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I have no information.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : I will narrow it and repeat. Despite not mentioning Yüksel Güran in your earlier sequential statements, is the reason you mentioned Yüksel Güran in your most recent statement— stating you saw her and describing that she was crying— solely because you remembered it at that time? Is it due to that? Within this framework, is there any other matter you have not related?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, there is no other matter.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Alright. You stated that you spoke with no one regarding Narin until the date of your apprehension, including your family.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Alright. Why then, after you were apprehended, did your family members make statements to include alibi evidence concerning you? For example, your first-degree blood relatives gave statements including testimony that on the date of the incident you were doing plaster work at the villa of a person named Derviş in Pirinçlik. Did you direct them in this regard?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : If you did not speak with your family members, why did they feel the need to protect you by creating such a chain of false evidence?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I never spoke with my family— I did not speak with my family at all.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Very well. On 15.08 (2024) you are the one who initiated the phone call. You called.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I called.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Yes. On 21 August 2024, at exactly what time did you leave your residence? Or leave the Tavşantepe neighborhood? State the time, or as far as you remember.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember the time, that is.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Did you leave in the morning hours?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : In the morning, yes. I had gone to the construction site there. Our— our house construction. I had called the electrician to pull the wiring.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : To your son’s construction?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. I had called the electrician.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Was anyone else with you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, no one else.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : With which vehicle did you go? By what means did you go? A red vehicle with 23 plates.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The red vehicle.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Was this vehicle with you the whole day? Did it change hands? At 11, at 12, and so on.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, it never changed.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : It was with you continuously?

Law. Mahir Akbilek : As you stated in your earlier testimony, was it parked on the side of your house facing Süveyla Özkan’s house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Around fifteen or sixteen o’clock?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Alright. You also said, in response to the presiding judge’s question, that after being called you climbed the slope using the path between the school and the far end of your barn.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : From there, I mean, they go back and forth like that.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : You also went up from there, did you not? You said when Salim called you.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : You went up on foot?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I went a bit from that side of it, that is— alright.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : You make the call at 15:08. A 42-second call— it nears 15:09. There is a 3.5–4 minute discrepancy in the school camera— it is not current. So in fact, around 15:11, Narin is climbing the slope— she climbed or finished. How is it that you did not encounter her? You would also have to be climbing that slope around 15:10.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I— I did not see her.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : At the okra field by Arif’s house-barn annex, in front of the balcony, between Salim’s and Arif’s houses— did you see or hear Narin and a child with Narin, or another person’s voices or movements?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Did you go straight? That is, you climbed the slope, straight ahead?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Straight.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : You did not see any other person?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I saw no one else.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Yes. Then, while visits were being conducted— I mean during the time you were in prison— especially your brothers, your brother Mehmet Bahtiyar and your brother known as Vecdi/Vedat— did they convey to you only information they had learned from outside?

Law. Mahir Akbilek : No.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : For example, did they tell you why they made false statements about you in the early stages and later changed their statements step by step toward the truth? Or did you speak in a reciprocal dialogue?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : They only came and— asked after my well-being. On this matter— I mean, we talked together about no other matter. I mean, only— how are you, are you well— my family— I especially wanted— let me see my family, let me see my family. I mean, for no other reason— I did not come there.

Presiding Judge : One moment, let us take this part again. It was a bit fragmented. Would you repeat?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : How, Your Honor?

Presiding Judge : That is, none of the family members had ordinary routine conversations with you, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, they came there to visit— to visit me.

Presiding Judge : They came to visit you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. I mean, about any other matter— I do not know— only that offer— only that, they said— and nothing else, that is.

Presiding Judge : They made a money offer?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, nothing else, alright.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Mr. Nevzat, why then did your spouse, Ms. Gazal, say that you left the house by car immediately after the 15:08 call?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : She had no knowledge of it. I mean, at the back, in the backyard— she did not know I was there. I was there.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : During your law enforcement statement, did you encounter any unusual pressure or ill-treatment?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Then we may assume that your statements at that time— and your behaviors reflected in the scene reconstruction report and its footage— were made of your free will as here.

Presiding Judge : We will not assume; we asked— and he said yes.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : You asked very well.

Presiding Judge : He said yes.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Mr. Nevzat, how afraid are you of Salim? How much would you fear him?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean— because of that— I was a bit hesitant, I was afraid. Otherwise, we have no other fear.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Why has your fear of Salim now passed? You are now able to make more detailed statements.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : After everything came to light, the fear is gone.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : You said you were under the effect of fear when giving your initial statements.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : That is correct.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Then despite your fear, why did you speak about Salim? You said Salim killed the child.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : At that moment as well— at that moment, were you not afraid that Salim could do you harm or have harm done to you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not think of it.

Law. Mahir Akbilek : Your Honor, thank you.

Presiding Judge : Thank you, Counsel.

### Law. Mustafa Demir

Law. Mustafa Demir : Now first, in his statement he says there was no one there other than the family. Does Nevzat have any kinship with the former mukhtar?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Mustafa Demir : None at all, near or distant—any kinship on your mother’s side, any connection?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Now he says he went to the house in the incident. So should we understand it like this? Salim killed her. The body is in the house. He goes outside. Is he going out to look for you? Why did he go out? Did you talk about this on the phone?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. We did not talk at all.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Alright, you took the body. In your earlier statement you said this: At home, my mother was at home. My children were at home. My wife was at home. The place you called the barn window of your house is actually the roof. You threw the child from the roof. Naturally there should be a sound. Was there no sound? Did no one hear?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Mustafa Demir : No one hears. So there was no sound.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Mustafa Demir : I see. Alright, you took the sack. Then how did you enter from the house to the barn?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : From there— from that place I entered. In our garden we planted eggplants and so on. From there, from there to the barn.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Is there an entrance to the barn from there? When we looked from there, we did not see any entrance door to the barn.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : From there, from above, I went down into the garden. I went to the vegetable garden. Eggplants and so on. From there I went through the door.

Law. Mustafa Demir : From the back side— from there, did you not enter the barn through the door?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, not through the door. I entered through the window at the back.

Law. Mustafa Demir : You also entered through the window.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Through the window.

Law. Mustafa Demir : There is a window there and you entered through that window?

Presiding Judge : Why did you enter through the window then? Why through the window?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Through the window— I mean I entered from there. I said if I go from the front perhaps someone will see. Because of that I went from the back and through the window there.

Presiding Judge : Did Salim tell you to do this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. No, Your Honor.

Presiding Judge : Why were you afraid someone would see you? I mean, why did you make such a plan saying someone might see?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean someone from my family might see, because my wife was at home.

Presiding Judge : I asked that. Your mother was at home as well?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : My mother was down below.

Presiding Judge : Alright. You did this so they would not see.

Law. Mustafa Demir : How high is the window from the ground? A window you can pass through comfortably?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Mustafa Demir : I see. Alright, you called at 15:08. You talked about water, correct? You called Salim at 15:08.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Mustafa Demir : What were you doing at that time? Why did you feel the need to call? How did the water issue come up? You never explained this. Was there no water at home? So what exactly were you doing at that moment?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : At that moment— there was no other water. I told my wife our water was coming, our water is not coming. Then I called Salim. Let them come, let the crew come and check. What is the reason, that is?

Law. Mustafa Demir : I think I was not understood; I will ask again. Now, you went to your son’s house in Tavşantepe to work. You came home for lunch. It is written like this in your statement.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. I had come for lunch.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Did you eat?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I ate.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Did you call Salim after lunch?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : After lunch.

Law. Mustafa Demir : So did you need water to wash your hands? Why was there a need for water? I do not understand— why?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : To water the garden, the trees.

Law. Mustafa Demir : But the hose was already attached to water the trees, right?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had drawn that water from my mother’s.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Was there water in the house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : There was water in the house.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Then your water at home was not cut off?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was taking from my mother’s. Because there was water.

Law. Mustafa Demir : I do not understand.

Presiding Judge : The counsel is asking this. In the taps in the house, was water flowing? That is the question.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, it was not flowing.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Alright. So you called at 15:08. Lunch and such were over. You called. You have no water. Then did you go out immediately afterward? Or did you sit?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Mustafa Demir : So did you not go out to water the garden immediately?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did go out.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Let us also clarify the garden.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I went out to water.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Let us clarify the garden, so there is no question mark. In front of your house there is a place with a mulberry tree.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Mustafa Demir : And there is also a place at the back with eggplants. Yes. Which did you water?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Uh, the mulberry tree one.

Law. Mustafa Demir : A moment ago you said eggplants. When first asked by the panel you said the place with the eggplants.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Eggplants first— not first. I mean from there— I had gone into the eggplants. There— watering— not watering the eggplants. When there were eggplants I had gone there. I mean I did not see my wife.

Law. Mustafa Demir : So let me ask clearly as I understand it. After you spoke at 15:08, did you go to the eggplants or to the place with the mulberries? You need to remember.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember that. I mean as far as I know, finally— I had gone out into the courtyard.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Now since in your house we do not know the courtyard, we do not know where you went— when you pull the hose, from where is the hose turned on? You also need to turn it on. Is the hose in the back? In the front? I mean on the side with the eggplants.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. I mean the hose was on the side of the mulberry trees.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Then where was the end— the end with which you would water? I am asking this for the following reason. If you went out at 15:08 and you were at the eggplants, there is no possibility you would not see Narin.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Well— I did not see Narin. Now if I had seen, I would say I saw.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Alright, we will not accept it. We will in any case explain this narrowed HTS shortly. According to the HTS, after you spoke at 15:08, at 15:10 it says you were in the area between Arif’s and Salim’s. By which route did you go up?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I— from that side— I went up. The eggplants.

Law. Mustafa Demir : So you went up the footpath? I understand. Alright, that sack, the thing— you walked with it in your hand in an open area. Where was your car parked?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : My car was down below.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Where? Where in relation to your house? I mean how far from your door? Was it flush? So when you enter your barn, as we understand, from above there is a flue. There is a window. What else is there? A door?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : There is a door on the inside.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Where does it open to? Where is the place you call the courtyard? Your house? Your mother’s house? The place with the mulberry tree?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Alright, very good. Then the place with the mulberry tree— is it visible from inside your house? Can you see the place you call the courtyard from inside your house? From the window, from the door?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : We can see.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Alright. You took the body, put it into a sack. How did you go out with it? From where did you exit? I mean did you exit through the door? Did you exit through the door of the courtyard?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I exited through the courtyard door.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Then did you turn back and take the blanket?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I went out together with the blanket.

Law. Mustafa Demir : You went out together. No one in the house saw you at that moment. Was there no sound while looking for the sack? You had thrown the child. You yourself entered through that narrow space. There was no sound at all during this? Here you say “my wife not like that,” but in her statement taken on 10.08.2024 your wife says: “After Nevzat called, he said he would water the trees and went out. He got into the car. I also went out after him. I saw him descend to the lower road.”

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Mustafa Demir : Is your wife lying?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I— such a thing— did I not go?

Presiding Judge : You have the right not to answer this question. The spouse who is a witness may face an investigation. One does not ask “Is she lying?”

Presiding Judge : No, you will not answer this question. No, no, no— this would put Gazal in the status of suspect, Counsel; this cannot be.

Presiding Judge : Anyone else among Enes’s counsel who wishes to ask? Alright. I have finished with Enes’s counsel. Thank you. We may take questions from Yüksel’s counsel. Please.


## Defense Counsels for Yüksel Güran

### Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Thanks to our colleagues and to you, virtually all possible questions were asked. We only want you to explain one point very clearly. Nevzat Bahtiyar, the patience of all Turkey has run out.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : True.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Please answer truthfully. When departing from your house, does Salim Güran’s house come first or Arif Güran’s house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not fully understand, that is.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When you leave your house and want to go to Salim Güran’s house, does Arif Güran’s house come first or Salim Güran’s house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Arif Güran’s house comes first.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : According to the narrowed base report, which we will later object to, you passed Arif Güran’s house at 15:10 and you are seen on the footpath between Salim Güran’s and Arif Güran’s houses. According to this record, and as determined by the school camera as well, Narin Güran was last seen at 15:11. That is, according to this record, while Narin had not yet reached the house, you are on the footpath. Did you take Narin from that footpath and go to the barn?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : You do not accept this record. Not accepting it, correct? You are asking notwithstanding that narrowed report?

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : We are asking notwithstanding acceptance.

Presiding Judge : Alright. Let us begin the sentence that way.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : We are only asking this. Now according to this narrowed base report, based on your movements, you should have seen Narin while she was going on that footpath. Did you not see her at all?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see at all.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You did not see at all. Did you love Narin?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Everyone loves Narin.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : I love her too.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : My child is the same. She is the same. Everyone’s is the same.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : So you loved Narin.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : She was an ordinary child to me. I love her.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Did Narin have a friendship with your grandchild?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You do not know?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When you bought things for your grandchild, would you ever buy for Narin?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : If she were there, I would buy for her too.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Did you ever give her chips or such?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I never did.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Did you ever say, “Narin, here, this pocket money is yours”?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Alright. My colleague asked a moment ago; we ask again. On the day of the incident, your wife says, “I asked Nevzat to pick up cheese from my sister Zeynep while going.”

Nevzat Bahtiyar : That is correct.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When Nevzat left the house, I was also on the balcony.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : She may have gone out to the balcony— I mean, I—

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : She says she saw you go by car. What do you say to this?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not go. I did not go by car.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Alright. In your earlier questioning you said: “When I went, I saw Narin lying on the floor inside the house. We wrapped her in a blanket and she was handed over to me that way. I went home,” correct? She was handed over to you inside the house.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You say you brought her out together with Salim.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You say you brought her out together with Salim. Then Salim came to take the blanket?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : He came down by car, correct? By car? When you left the house— we have now clearly seen Arif Güran’s house from maps— when coming from the barn side it is like a platter— the village square. Correct? It can be seen from everywhere.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : That slope can be seen from everywhere in the village, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean that— I mean, the whole village—

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When going to your barn— when going to the barn from Arif Güran’s house— would no one in the village see that place?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : But there was no one.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : They could see; there was no one. Well then, while Salim had a car, why did you feel the need to carry with a blanket? Would it not have been more practical to put it in the car?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : How do you not know? Better— at least no one would see. What did he refer to when he said it?

Presiding Judge : He did not see Salim’s car.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Salim comes down by car for the blanket to the barn.

Presiding Judge : No, no— I asked in the first statement. Did you see Salim’s car? He had not seen his car.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : No, I am asking this: If indeed— he takes the lifeless body. Instead of carrying it in his arms all the way to the barn—

Presiding Judge : I understand what you mean.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Why did you feel the need to carry it in your arms when there was a car?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I had not seen the car.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Where exactly did Salim, by car, take the blanket from you? Exactly where.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Exactly next to the car he took it.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Where was your car?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : My car was in front of the gate— that is, on the lower side of the courtyard.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : On the lower side of the courtyard, on the school side. Yes.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The road leading to the school.

Law. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : On the side of the road leading to the school. Alright, sir. Thank you.

### Law. Tuncay Erkuş

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : Did you enter the house where Narin Güran was together with Salim Güran? Did you enter Arif Güran’s house?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, we entered together.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : Did you enter the room together? Narin Güran was on the floor.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : She was on the floor.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : You entered the room.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember which room it was.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : What was in the room? Can you describe the room?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember much. I mean anything— I already do not remember that matter.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : You say an empty room. Let’s describe that.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : From the entrance of the house, which direction did you turn? You do not remember at all.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Presiding Judge : One moment, counsel. Now, you entered the house. After you entered, which direction did you head? To the left side or the right side? Did you go straight? Narin’s left side, right? Where was Narin’s body? Which room did you enter?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Honestly I do not clearly remember that. Which room it was.

Presiding Judge : Now I am saying this according to what is stated in the indictment. I am expressly stating the allegation. When Salim Güran entered the house at 15:22, between 15:22 and 15:26 it was in the empty room opposite the kitchen.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Presiding Judge : Alright. Amen.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : Sir, we would also like to ask this. There was a vehicle transaction. You had a vehicle transaction with Arif Güran. After a problem arose with the vehicle, it was returned and money was demanded from you. This was asked at the outset. When money was first demanded from you, did you immediately take the money and pay it? Or was some kind of “assembly” formed about this? In colloquial speech, a gathering— who was present in that gathering?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Rükbettin Kaya was there, Cahit Kaya was there.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : Yes. How much did they say you had to pay?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : There— at first he said 50,000 lira. Then “You will give 40,000 lira.” Salim said, “I will give 10,000–20,000 lira.” He said, “I will give 20,000 and bees.” Eighty thousand lira. Then Salim said, “I am not giving.”

Nevzat Bahtiyar : And I said, if he does not give, I mean I will give— I will give 50.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : When Salim did not pay that, you had to pay 50.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I paid the 50.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : How did you pay the money? Where did you obtain it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The landlord first gave 40,000. I got up and sent it. I sent it to Arif. Then for the 10,000 lira I called him. He said, “I’m at a condolence.” I said, “Send me the account number. I’ll transfer 10,000 lira to your account.”

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : Did your brother pay the 10,000 lira? Or did you pay it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I sent my brother. Mehmet sent it.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : Yes. You did not say that earlier. You said it afterward. Now, in all phases of the investigation you said you were afraid, that you were afraid of Salim Güran— which has been asked here repeatedly.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : You said you could not make any statement regarding reaching Narin Güran’s lifeless body. Since Salim Güran was detained on 02.09.2024, the threat was then removed. You were under no threat.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : For 6 days, over 3,000 personnel, helicopters, 80 drones continued the search. That is, you were in a more secure position. The threat was gone. Why did you not state the location? You still allowed the searches to continue. Or if she had not been found, would you still have stated the location?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean I did not have the opportunity. I could not find the opportunity. To remove her from there.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : Yes— if you had found the opportunity on the 8th, you would have removed her. So did you remove her? Did you confess, or did law enforcement find her as a result of their investigation?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : So consequently, you are not the confessor.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I came home. I knew— I knew they would take me. I sat at home, I did not run away. I could have fled. I did not flee.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : So whenever little Narin was found, you would be taken.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I knew this.

Law. Tuncay Erkuş : So despite that you did not say it. There was no threat either. Alright sir, thank you.

Presiding Judge : Why did you think of taking the body from there, Nevzat? You said you would hide it. I mean why did you feel the need to hide it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Uh— I thought that— then— I mean I thought to myself. I said why did I leave it there? I mean I would have taken her out of there.

Presiding Judge : You would have taken her out, but there was no opportunity, is that it?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : There was no opportunity.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was going to leave her on a roadway. Someone would come and take her.

Presiding Judge : So you thought she would be found by coincidence, but you could not do it.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I could not.

Presiding Judge : You thought of this yourself. You did not plan it with Salim or anything. Then why did you say “I never thought of fleeing”? I mean why? What was the motive that drove this? Why did you enter such a thought— when thinking “Shall I flee? Shall I not flee?”

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, honestly I never thought of fleeing. I also wanted her to be found— I already knew— why?

Presiding Judge : You knew you would be caught?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I knew.

Presiding Judge : So you said there was no need to run?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No need to run. How would I be caught then.

### Law. Furkan Çakır

Law. Furkan Çakır : Before I proceed to my questions, my condolences to our nation for this heinous incident. Our sole aim is for the full material truth to be revealed transparently in this trial. Everyone is here for that purpose. Now, Mr. Nevzat, in all the statements you have given, you specifically and systematically declare that you were afraid of Salim Güran. But Mr. Salim was detained on 02.09.2024. You also say that after he was detained you felt genuine remorse. Why did you not go and confess during that six-day period?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I never thought of it.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Then there is not, in a real sense, anything— I mean you have no moral unease?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I did not think of it. I only— I was going to leave her on a street, in a road. So they could find her.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Very well. Now, in your statements you said, “I entered the house. I entered Yüksel Güran’s house. After entering the house, I said Narin Güran’s body, her dead body, was in a room on the left.” Now do you remember how many rooms there were on the left?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Alright, you entered the house. Do you remember which room on the left you entered?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Alright. Then, were there any furnishings in the room? Or let us assume there were no furnishings. Did any item in the room that could not be moved catch your attention? Alright then. Now, Your Honor, while reserving our objections to the cell-site records, especially the expert report— yes, we will say it— but let us assume the cell-site records are correct. According to your statement, you took the body and put it in the car. My apologies for saying “body.” You took Narin’s lifeless body and put it in the car. You say when you looked back you saw Yüksel Güran. But in the cell-site records— if they are indeed accurate— at those times and on that date, Yüksel Güran appears to be at home. So how did the situation of seeing her on the slope occur?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I saw her there. I only saw her there. I did not see her inside the house.

Law. Furkan Çakır : So you clearly remember seeing her on the slope. But that conflicts with the cell-site records. Very well. Now, Your Honor, this will be an external question, but one of the points that drew our attention is this: In some statements by your son İbrahim Bahtiyar and your brother, there is an expression like “Stay away from the Gürans.” But in most of your statements you say “The Gürans are our friends, Salim Güran is my thirty-year friend.” Did you ever make such a statement?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Furkan Çakır : You did not. Alright, my last question then. Can you tell us about the moment and manner of your arrest? How were you arrested? Where were you arrested? And describe the manner of arrest. Chronologically. Where?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Uh— I was inside the house.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Whose house were you in?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was in my son’s house.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Your son?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : In his house, inside the room.

Law. Furkan Çakır : About what time was it, do you remember?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Alright— for example, law enforcement came. Gendarmerie personnel came. Did the gendarmerie personnel knock and enter, or had you already heard some noise?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : If I described it wrong, the door was open, that is.

Law. Furkan Çakır : It was open, the gendarmerie personnel entered directly?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Already from down below how they came— alright. I already knew they were gendarmerie.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Alright, when you saw the gendarmerie personnel, how did you react? Or did you go straight before them, or did you feel the need to hide?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was sitting in the room. They took my son. He said today too— “Dad,” he said— “you come as well.” He said, “Who are you?” I said, “I’m Nevzat.” They took me upstairs.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Alright, I will have one last follow-up. Until that moment, had you considered becoming a confessor, or telling the situation you have described— as we see it? Had you thought of telling it? Or did you decide this after seeing the gendarmerie?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : After seeing the gendarmerie.

Law. Furkan Çakır : You decided this the moment you saw the gendarmerie?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Furkan Çakır : Alright, thank you.

### Law. Doğuş Can Kurucu

Law. Doğuş Can Kurucu : Mr. Nevzat, I have a question for you as well. You know that Mr. Salim’s and Mr. Arif’s houses face each other.

Presiding Judge : Let us take the microphone, counsel. If you take the other microphone, everyone can hear. Hm.

Law. Doğuş Can Kurucu : You said that Mr. Salim’s and Mr. Arif’s houses face each other. This is clear in the file anyway. As can be clearly seen in the PTS record at 14:33, Mr. Salim arrives home with the children. Given that his house faces Mr. Arif’s, does it make sense to you— as alleged— that after having relations with Yüksel Güran, Mr. Salim killed Narin and handed her to you? Did you ever question this within yourself? Did you not find it odd? Does it not seem odd to you? Did you never question it? No further questions, Your Honor.

Presiding Judge : He said, “I never questioned it; it does not seem odd.” Alright. I am saying it so that it is properly recorded in the minutes.


## Defense Counsel for Salim Güran

### Law. Onur Akdağ

Law. Onur Akdağ : When did you last see Narin alive?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Onur Akdağ : So you did not see her alive on the day of the incident?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Had you ever seen her alive before the incident?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know— if I had been at home, maybe I might have seen her, I do not know.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Did you gather at Salim’s house because of the money matter?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : How?

Law. Onur Akdağ : Did you gather at Salim’s house because of the money matter?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Onur Akdağ : The meeting was held there, correct?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Onur Akdağ : When did you gather then? When did you pay the last installment over the stolen car matter? Regarding the car that was returned because of the car issue— the final owner filed a lawsuit. Money was sent because of this matter. When did you pay Arif the last 10,000 TL, that last installment?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Was it recently? Very soon after the child was killed, or months earlier?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Law. Onur Akdağ : The money matter— when did the meeting occur?

Law. Onur Akdağ : Was it in 2024? Was it summer, winter, spring? When?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : In 2024. Was it summer? I mean I do not remember whether it was summer. Was it summer?

Law. Onur Akdağ : During the incident, at the time of the incident, did you think at all about Arif? Did Arif ever cross your mind? “I am carrying his child, I cannot bear this burden.”

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. I did not think at all.

Law. Onur Akdağ : At the time of the incident, were you angry with Arif?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. I was not angry.

Presiding Judge : When he said he would get your money back, did you trust Arif? That you could get your money?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I trusted him. He was with his wife then.

Presiding Judge : So you believed him.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : If he got it, he would give the money; if not, you had already paid your money.

Presiding Judge : And you believed this. Very well.

Law. Onur Akdağ : So, Salim asked you for the blanket. Did you not find that odd? I mean, he gave you the child, he gave you the entire body. Did he then come after the blanket?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Did you ever go to, or later visit, the place where the child was found— Eğertutmaz stream?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I never went.

Law. Onur Akdağ : You never went?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I never went.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Not even for a crime-scene indication?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Not at all. I mean for the crime-scene indication, with the gendarmerie— I went at the very end.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Then why, in the nights following the incident, did you not sleep in your own home but slept at your son’s house in Çarıklı? Were you afraid of being taken into custody?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I never slept there. I was always in the village. On the first day, the day I was caught, the roads were already closed. They told us the entrances and exits were closed. Because of that I came to the house in Çarıklı. Otherwise I would have gone to the village. If I had gone to the village, I would have been caught there anyway.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Sir, how was your relationship with Salim before the incident?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It was good.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Then why did Salim not call you on the phone for about two or three months?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Did you call him?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I may have called.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Did you ever go to the coffeehouse, to play okey, and so on? Did you meet in the village in the context of a closeness, a friendship?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : From time to time he would go to the coffeehouse to play okey, he would go to play okey.

Law. Onur Akdağ : When did you last go?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.

Presiding Judge : The sense here is— did you go to play okey after this incident?

Law. Onur Akdağ : No, no. In the three months before the incident.

Presiding Judge : Alright, I understand that— and did you ever meet at the coffeehouse after the incident?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Presiding Judge : Alright.

Law. Onur Akdağ : So you do not think your relationship with Salim was damaged because of the money matter?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. We were talking.

Law. Onur Akdağ : When the gathering was held, did Salim make you an offer regarding this plaster work?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The offer— I mean there was a house. Yes. His brother had a house. We did not agree. We did not agree on money between us. I did not do it.

Law. Onur Akdağ : So afterward, did Salim and his brother not give you the plaster work for the house they would have built?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The plaster, he did not give me the plaster work.

Law. Onur Akdağ : So did you not talk at all about the plaster? You set a price for the plaster. After that, after quoting a very high price—

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I quoted 150,000 lira.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Ah, so you talked about it because of the plaster matter, right? Was this because of the car matter, then?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No. It was not about the car matter. I said, if you like, speak to Salim. If he wants, I will still do it. I said it was not a matter about the money. I used that phrase.

Law. Onur Akdağ : On the day of the incident, when you called Salim at 15:08 about the water matter, did you ever ask where Salim was?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, I never asked.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Did you ask what Salim was doing?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No, no.

Law. Onur Akdağ : In her statement, your wife Gazal Bahtiyar said Salim was eating at that time and that he would look into the water matter after eating.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Is your water line the same as your mother’s water line, or separate?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : It is the same. The same. But since theirs is lower, theirs comes, ours does not.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Is your water line the same as the village’s water line, or separate?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : The same.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Now, that day no one’s water was cut. Why was your water cut? Why did you call Salim for water?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Our water was not coming anyway. That is why I called. I mean, for the network personnel to come and take a look. I mean, was it clogged or what? Why is it not coming? Because of that I called him.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Now why are you afraid of Salim? Had you ever seen Salim commit any offense before? Beating someone, resisting someone, exercising dominance, or did he ever threaten you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not want to speak on that matter.

Law. Onur Akdağ : You do not want to speak. Is your family and the family of Gazal Bahtiyar a large family? That is, is your family in Çarıklı a large family, or a small nuclear family?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Ordinary, I mean. We are eight siblings.

Law. Onur Akdağ : You are eight siblings. All adults, right? Yes. And where does Gazal Bahtiyar’s family live? Her brothers, those who are village guards? Are they a large family?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : A large family.

Law. Onur Akdağ : A large family. When you are in trouble, when someone threatens you, when someone wants to make you do something you do not want to do, would your brothers not come to your aid? Or would Gazal Bahtiyar’s family not come to your aid?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : My brothers would come, but my brothers-in-law— I do not think so.

Law. Onur Akdağ : How would your brothers come?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : One of the brothers would come, the uncles would come.

Presiding Judge : Whose brothers would come?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I mean if I had a— I mean if something happened in the city— my brothers would come.

Presiding Judge : Ah, your brothers would come, yes?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Alright. My uncle would come. I mean who else would come.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Alright. I ask again to confirm. How many years have you, as a family, been in the village?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : If not idle, 50— 56— 56.

Presiding Judge : He said since he was born.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Two hours ago it sounded as if you were living in the village like a dependent.

Presiding Judge : No, no, he said since he was born.

Law. Onur Akdağ : You were not living as a dependent, were you?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I was not living as a dependent, that is.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Let me ask something. Is the Güran family larger, or the Kaya family?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Are there more members of the Güran family or the Kaya family? Now, on the day of the incident you said you borrowed 5,000 lira from someone. From whom did you borrow that money?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : I borrowed it from my brother Mehmet. I mean that.

Law. Onur Akdağ : You said you took it from Mehmet’s wife.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.

Law. Onur Akdağ : What is the name of Mehmet’s wife?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : Ayşe Batu. I took it from her, I mean— I paid the electrician’s fee.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Why, for example, did you not borrow from someone else in the village? Did you need to borrow from Ayşe?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Do you have a romantic relationship with Şeyma Kaya?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Have you ever wanted to strangle someone before? Have you ever tried to strangle someone before?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Onur Akdağ : I will raise this in my defense. I will mention it over a matter from 4–5 years ago. Again— recall it if you wish. We will address this with our witnesses.

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Onur Akdağ : Mr. Nevzat, did any public official, the JASAT team, or your wife Gazal Bahtiyar prompt you in any way that led you to frequently change your statements?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : No.

Law. Onur Akdağ : That is, you already said what you needed to say. You said you were afraid of Salim, that Salim killed her. Why then did you change some embellishments in your statements? Did you polish some details?

Nevzat Bahtiyar : At that time I was afraid. Mm-hm.
