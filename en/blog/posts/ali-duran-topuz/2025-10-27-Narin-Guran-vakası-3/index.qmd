In today’s section there is no theory, no wordiness, there are “incidents.”

Perhaps the most critical day in the Narin case was 31 August. On that day, uncle Salim Güran, who was also the headman of the village, was taken into custody; the news reported that “suspicious DNA,” or DNA belonging to Narin, had been found in his vehicle. It was an extremely critical day, especially because of a post that a Facebook user named _Murat Çınar Çatalca_ made that same day. That post would set the direction of both the media and social media and, it seems, of the case file itself. A month later it turned out to be _fake_, and afterward almost no one cared about it anymore, but it had two important features: First, it used some information that at that time was not known to the public but was known to those conducting the investigation (and to the lawyers, journalists, and politicians in contact with them); second, it laid the foundation for the “the family is terribly guilty” theory that would survive all the way to the judgment stage.

## The Father’s Complaint: Don’t Hurt Us on Social Media

Before getting to that critical day and that critical post, we need a few more notes in order to understand the atmosphere between 27 and 31 August 2024; some of these may sound repetitive, but their importance will become clearer as we proceed. That day, Arif Güran (the father) would say he would file a <a href="https://www.yenisafak.com/hayat/kayip-narin-guranin-babasi-gozalti-ve-ifadelere-iliskin-konustu-bu-karalama-niye-4641991" target="_blank">complaint</a><sup>[1]</sup> about humiliating news and posts:

> "They call in the headman (that is, Salim Güran) for a statement, they call me in, they call her mother in. Why this slander? If my son is guilty, if I am guilty, that’s something for the state to know. We’re waiting. They said the same about my son. They said the teeth marks were Narin’s, that’s a lie."
>
> "He is the village headman; can’t he go and give a statement, or go in for someone else, or go for his own statement? We are waiting just like you. We can’t sleep anyway, we can’t drink. Our minds aren’t even with us. Don’t hurt us on social media."

Why was Arif Güran complaining? A theory was slowly taking shape on social media (under the effect of statements given, leaked information, and the highly flawed reporting of those statements and leaks), and posts accompanied by harsh accusations against the family were starting to circulate. As early as 27 August, even if not yet in newspapers, social media had already begun to fill up with heavy accusations against Enes Güran and thus against the family. The number of users who were sure that Enes Güran and two of his friends “smoked weed” and even more sure that they had harmed a dog (at first it was mistreatment, then it became torture, and finally it was said to be rape) was increasing at a steady pace. The door had been opened to direct insults against the family.

## She Saw Something She Shouldn’t Have Seen

The argument “Narin saw something she shouldn’t have seen” was also first voiced on social media: the oldest trace of that phrase on social media goes back to 28 August; an account with not many followers and apparently choosing to remain “anonymous” wrote the following:

> “A journalist on NTV identified the person. Someone very close. I think Narin saw something she shouldn’t have seen. I hope I’m wrong and Narin is found.”

The leaked procedures and information about Enes and the theories of these zealous champions of conscience were simmering day by day, moving toward becoming the “general public perception” on 31 August and afterward. The false claim that Enes and his friends “hurt/raped a dog” was showing signs of being merged with the campaign against government proposals about stray animals, and people were being called to the rally to be held in Yenikapı on 1 September 2024. The formula “Narin saw something she shouldn’t have seen” spread rapidly especially after Salim Güran’s arrest on 2 September, and would become virtually _the essence and summary_ of the whole affair. Now, in order to approach 31 August day by day, it is useful to look closely at some critical posts:

## Social Media Posts

### 1. The Geography Will Sell Out Anything to Save Its Own Skin

27 August, from an account with _respectable followers_: 

> “Narin must have seen them raping the dog. These types are extremely dangerous, mark my words. The geography will sell anything, abandon anything, just to save its own skin.”

The post was dropping the first hint of the arguments that would later, in September, be deployed by _orientalist_ and _colonialist_ masterminds, with the word _geography_.

### 2. Who Did the Mother Fear So Much That...

27 August, from a _respectable_ account with 11,000 followers, which would receive `2.3 million` views:

> And the mother… She spoke on air about a detail that may change the course of the investigation: “I’m saying this for the first time, I didn’t say it because I thought they’d suspect us. At the hour when #Narin disappeared, her older brother and two of his friends were behind the house smoking tobacco and they harmed a #dog. I said son, that’s a sin, have mercy..." After these words, in the interest of the integrity of the investigation — which is how it should be — the mother’s voice was cut from the broadcast and it was announced that the gendarmerie had called her in again to give another statement.
>
> Is the ‘tobacco’ she mentioned marijuana?
>
> From her lament “Son, have mercy,” what are we supposed to understand? That they ra**d the dog?
>
> Who/what was the mother afraid of that she didn’t include this detail in her statement?! Time is running out, and when the pieces come together, the picture that emerges tears my heart apart! A village of 20 households! 7 days, just 7 days!! But don’t look at me, child… Still we keep hope alive. I’m saying, just come back! #FindNarin #WhereIsNarin #Apocalypse #WhereAreYouNarinGüran

### 3. A Person Who Kills an Animal Kills a Human

28 August 2024, a post:

> #1EylüldeYenikapıdayız #narin This fiend (referring to the person who assaulted and killed the child named Eylül Yağlıkara) raped an animal; if he had been jailed for that, he wouldn’t have preyed on Eylül. A person who kills an animal will kill a human. A person who rapes an animal will rape a human. Know this, shape the law accordingly, and protect our children… Don’t release perverts and killers...

This was a low-follower account with little engagement, but the post it quoted from 27 August had received `6,000` likes, `1,000` reposts, and more than `400,000` views.

### 4. What They Did to the Dog Cannot Be Ignored

> Recall that the killer of little Eylül (referring to a victim in another case) had previously ra**d a dog! Don’t forget! What the brother and his two friends did to the dog, which the mother said she kept silent about because “they’d suspect us,” also cannot be ignored. #Narin #WhereIsNarinGüran

### 5. Those Who Encourage Killing Dogs... Are Instigators

Post dated 28 August, one of the attempts to link animal rights activism to the case:

> If the killer of Narin turns out to be the BROTHER who TORTURED and RAPED a dog,
> Those who CAUSED this torture and rape,
> Those who say the streets will be safe only if there are no stray dogs,
> Those who ENCOURAGE KILLING dogs and thus pave the way for killing people,
> THEY ARE THE INSTIGATORS OF THIS MURDER!!!
>
> #SokakHayvanlariSahipsizDegildir #1EylüldeYenikapıdayız

### 6. A 9-Million-Follower Account: “THE FAMILY AND THE UNCLE, IT’S ALL A BIT MESSY”

That same day, from a very famous and philanthropic musician’s account with more than `9 million` followers — which, compared to others, was “relatively” mild:

> Ahbaplar investigated.
>
> #narin
>
> Bite marks were found on her brother’s arm.
>
> He said “I bit myself.”
>
> The matter has been referred to forensics.
>
> We’re waiting for the result.
>
> The family and the uncle, it’s all a bit messy.
>
> The authorities are also looking into this special situation.
>
> There are inconsistencies in family members’ statements.

As one would expect, it got `8 million` views, `52,000` likes, `5,000` reposts, and over `2,000` replies, mentions, etc.

One feature of the post was that it showed not only journalists and lawyers but also _volunteers involved in social aid efforts_ had access to certain information; “the family’s relations are a bit messy,” coupled with “the authorities are also looking into this special situation,” tells us this. Let us note immediately that _in the Murat Çınar Çatalca post_ there are insinuations of problematic relationships between Uncle-Brother and Uncle-Mother; this shows that the _fake account holder_ and certain people around the case were feeding from the same pool of information.

In the comments below, the _dog theory_ was voiced, the Minister of the Interior was mentioned, and people were saying things like “poor girl born into the wrong family.”

### 7. Poor Little Girl Born into the Wrong Family

Another deep-conscience post from 28 August:

> I wish you were alive, beautiful child, I wish they could just take you from that family and protect you, I wish! – Yesterday, her father, a Hüda-Par sympathizer, said “I turned my phone off”! That struck me as odd… And both the mother and the father have always been chillingly cold-blooded! – Today it’s been announced that the brother was detained to collect DNA, and that there were bite marks on his arm. So, despite tırnak marks on his arms from torturing and raping the dog, the brother was detained and then released! And afterwards he says in his statement “I did those marks myself”! The part about the brother hurting the dog, that’s sexual abuse, and of course maybe they killed it afterward! Unfortunately Narin was killed, the most innocent one in the family is gone… What they’re looking for isn’t Narin, it’s her body! In the first hours, if a missing child isn’t found, the chance of finding them alive is next to zero. The moment she disappeared they should have taken the entire family in! Her father, her mother, her brother, all of them! Poor missing little girl born into the wrong family! As for everyone left behind — including the crying wailing mother — may you all rot in hell! #WeAreLookingForNarinGueran #WhereAreYouNarinGüran

One million views, seven thousand likes, and more than 650 reposts.

### 8. Educate Your Sons First, Not Your Daughters

> So it all starts not with sending them to Quran courses, but with teaching morals to your child within the family. Educate your sons first, not your daughters. That bastard of a brother — even if he didn’t do anything to Narin — should still be prosecuted for that disgusting thing he did to the dog.

### 9. The Whole Family Knows the Truth and Is Hiding It

Post dated 29 August:

> Narin’s brother Enes raped a dog that day,
> Smoked weed,
> There are Narin’s teeth marks on his arm.
>
> Most likely Narin is dead and her killer is her brother. The whole family knows the truth and is hiding it..
>
> From the very first moment they gave only partial information. Their facial expressions were more shock and panic than sadness.

The idea of trying to build a theory by reading the emotional state of the family members — “their facial expressions were more shock and panic than sadness” — was perhaps the most important issue caused by the _leaks_. Later, both in the publicly available documents of the main case and in the “aiding in concealing the perpetrator” case, we would see that this method was adopted by the investigation/prosecution units themselves.

### 10. A Post

On 31 August, a representative of an organization doing work in the public interest issued a warning to comply with the broadcast ban:

> Regarding the ongoing speculative posts about Narin, apart from UCİM Chair Saadet Özkan, Deputy Chair Yücel Ceylan, and the association’s National Legal Coordinators and Legal Counsel, we kindly request that no unverified information be published in the name of UCİM by any of our other units; we also state that we bear no legal responsibility in the event of a violation of the broadcast ban.

But the same person did not see any need to correct or remove their 27 August post “in line with the request not to publish unverified information”:

> The mother has started talking!! The brother who’s about to go to the army and his two friends were behind the house at the time Narin disappeared, smoking cigarettes and harming a dog. The mother said “I’m saying this for the first time, I didn’t say it because I thought they’d suspect us.” The mother also knows that people who harm animals can’t be trusted. The truth will come out, even if late; just a little longer.
>
> #WhereIsNarinGüran

In response to that post, someone with 23,000 followers and respected followers wrote:

> To them, raping a dog is such a normal thing that the woman tells it calmly, and she didn’t even intervene. We’ve been saying this all along, but we couldn’t get it across: I hope you’ve now understood that the thing you stayed silent about today, chalking it up to “just a dog,” will not remain limited to the dog. 

Note the emphasis on “them,” which, like the word “geography,” carries the markers of veiled hate speech.

In short, at that point the “harm to the dog” lie still seemed “relatively” plausible, but the broadcaster of the program had already issued a correction on 28 August — although who cares, really? Moreover, “the brother who’s going to the army” wasn’t Enes anyway, but does that matter? No one felt like deleting a post that had gotten `4.6 million` views.

## The Detention of Salim Güran and the Accompanying Reports

When Salim Güran was detained on 31 August and arrested on 2 September, one of the claims accompanying this was that “DNA was found in the vehicle.” Nearly all newspapers and online outlets naturally shared the related reports; some (like TRT Haber or DW Türkçe) presented it as their own reporting, some quoted according to their style, some simply went with _copy-paste_. The “most editorially careful” versions included the following:

> DNA found on the driver’s seat of S.G.’s vehicle matched the DNA taken from Narin Güran’s clothes and blanket. This development made the uncle a suspect.
>
> It was also determined that the uncle, S.G., left the village quickly 15 minutes after Narin Güran was last seen with her friends.
>
> Gendarmerie teams also examined the uncle’s phone. As a result of this examination, it was determined that S.G. had deleted WhatsApp messages and call logs from his phone.

Clearly these were gendarmerie-sourced details. The statement “it was determined that he left the village quickly 15 minutes after Narin Güran was last seen with her friends” was rather striking; even more striking was the “interaction” between the post from the fake Facebook account and this information.

## A Fake News Bomb: Murat Çınar Çatalca

One of the incidents whose impact was later forgotten — the way it steered the process overshadowed — was the _Murat Çınar Çatalca_ incident. On 31 August 2024, a certain MÇÇ left striking allegations in a comment under a Facebook post that Salim Güran had made on 15 August. That same day, an account with 300 followers took a screenshot of the FB comment and shared it on X without comment:

> #FindNarinGüran #FindNarinNow
>
> #WeAreLookingForNarinGüran
>
> The message written by a man named Murat Çınar Çatalca on the social media account of Narin’s uncle..

Despite the limited follower count, it received 80,000 views, but it took another day or two for the matter to become _publicly mainstream_. The fact that content shared from _anonymous_ or _fake_ accounts could become mainstream within one or two days is of course partly a result of the catastrophic condition of the media, but on the other hand it raises suspicion that there were people acting with full awareness of that _condition_. This particular case is the most typical example of that.

The public only learned that MÇÇ was a fake account on 2 October 2024, from a report by _Mustafa Şekeroğlu_ at Habertürk. Until then, hundreds of articles and thousands of posts treated what was written under that name as “the absolute truth,” and the content became, for millions of people, the greatest proof of reality. To this post, the lie “blood and vomit samples were found in Salim Güran’s car” was also added.

## A Flood of Reports

An <a href="https://www.sabah.com.tr/galeri/yasam/son-dakika-gelismesi-narin-guranin-amcasi-salim-guran-hakkinda-sok-iddia-aracindan-kan-kusmuk-ve-idrar-ornegi-alinmis" target="_blank">example report</a><sup>[2]</sup> using all of these elements together came out in the newspaper Sabah on 04.09.2024; I mention it only as an example, because A Haber, Gerçek Gündem, Halk TV, Takvim, CNN Türk, Karar, T24, and Türkiye, among others, all produced similar reports, and smaller news portals kept multiplying the same reports with slight variations.

![](20240904-sabah.png){fig-align="center" width="50%" fig-alt="Screenshot of Sabah’s 04.09.2024 report. Headline: BREAKING | Shocking allegation about missing Narin Güran’s uncle, Salim Güran: Blood, vomit, and urine samples were taken from his vehicle!"}

In that report, another _false piece of information_ pointing to the uncle was used:

> A Haber correspondent Sinan Yılmaz gave details on Salim Güran’s statement in the case Turkey is talking about. The allegation was raised that Salim Güran had said to Narin’s father, “I will make you suffer such a pain that you will never forget it for the rest of your life.”

It was raised — but whether it was true or not was apparently not seen as important. MÇÇ’s statements were also included in the report, of course not forgetting to add the phrase “it was learned that he gave a statement to the gendarmerie.”

## A Highly Assertive Report That Contains Its Own Contradiction

On the same 4 September, the halktv.com.tr site published a signed, “exclusive”-tagged report titled “This is how the first clue in the Narin case was caught”<a href="https://halktv.com.tr/gundem/narin-olayinda-ilk-ipucu-boyle-yakalandi-867385h" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. The sub-headline stated that Salim Güran had been arrested and said, “Uncle Güran was taken into custody because of a post he made on Facebook.”

I chose the Halk TV report partly because it was signed — relying both on institutional and personal trust — and partly because it was one of the earliest and most widely cited. Here too, as with the outlets that either quoted or produced their own versions, editorial work was highly limited.

The article stated, “First Çatalca’s statement was taken, then Uncle Güran was detained”; it did not say “it was claimed,” “it was alleged,” “it was said,” “it was reported,” “it was asserted,” etc. The writer and the publisher were sure. The situation was definite. But that certainty flipped in the last sentence of the article: “On the other hand, it was learned that the gendarmerie investigating the incident did not take the statement of any person named Murat Çınar Çatalca who commented on social media.”

In short, it seems that neither the two outlets I cited nor any outlet that quoted them or produced their own reports had actually opened and looked at the _social media post_ — that is, the FB comment. Nothing about the user had been checked, the oddities in the content had not been scrutinized, it had simply been accepted _as true_. Until 2 October, when it was “definitively learned” that the account was _fake_ and operating from abroad, there had been a downpour of news, video packages, TV programs, and posts. In another outlet (koza24), the sentence “it was learned that Çatalca went to the gendarmerie and gave a statement” was used confidently. On 4 September, A Haber, in its extensive <a href="https://www.ahaber.com.tr/galeri/yasam/kayip-narin-bulundu-mu-cesetsiz-cinayet-tartismasi-iste-detaylar/24" target="_blank">report</a><sup>[4]</sup>, featured snippets from the uncle’s interrogation, repeated Çatalca’s allegations without criticism, but did label them as “allegations.”

Yeni Şafak, for example, repeated the “he went and gave a statement” claim on 5 September and turned what he had written into news without any critical filter. Another site (TRHaber) repeated the same things on 9 September; it did not include the detail about “giving a statement.”

A “brand” like Milliyet, in a 10 September report that also included expert opinions, saw no problem in using the following phrasing: “DNA samples belonging to Narin Güran were found on the front seat of the car belonging to her uncle, who was arrested, Salim Güran. For Salim Güran, a gas station attendant named Murat Çınar Çatalca gave a statement to the gendarmerie saying ‘Either Narin was unconscious or Salim had strangled her with his own hands and she was lying on the front seat, and there was a dark brown blanket on top of her,’ and afterward the uncle was arrested.”

After Nevzat Bahtiyar was caught, on 11 September there was inevitably a report titled “The gas station worker’s statements confirmed what Bahtiyar said”<a href="https://www.takvim.com.tr/guncel/2024/09/11/narin-guran-cinayeti-cozuldu-mu-cesedin-sarildigi-battaniye-kime-ait-dugumu-anne-guranin-itiraflari-cozecek/5" target="_blank"><sup>[5]</sup></a>: “The words of a gas station employee who commented on Uncle Salim Güran’s social media account” had, it said, confirmed Bahtiyar’s statement.

By now not only the brother but also the uncle and the mother had been included almost definitively in the “guilty” lineup. Now we can look more closely at the _content and form_ of the MÇÇ post; but this is already so long that I will leave that for the next section. In my next section, titled “The content, language, and tone of the information bomb,” (perhaps the most critical part), we will meet again.
