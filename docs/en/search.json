    "text": "Presiding Judge ​\n\nPresiding Judge : Muhammed Kaya. Muhammed, you’re wearing red again.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I had no other coat. I had no other coat, sir.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Very well. You are detained, I believe. In another investigation. First of all, you have the right to refrain from testifying. On one side is your uncle, on another your uncle’s son. On another your aunt-in-law. You have the right to refrain from testifying. Do not let it be misunderstood by us that refraining from testifying means you answered questions and ran away. It is your legal right. Do you wish to testify?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : Okay.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then we will hear you without oath. There is an investigation concerning you. Because of that investigation I will intervene in some questions. You also have the right not to answer questions that impute a crime to you, that allege you are an offender. Let me also explain this to the press so it is not misunderstood. Friends, here is the situation. The witness is a suspect in another investigation. Therefore, they have the right not to answer questions here that would affect their status in that investigation. This is a right granted by the CMK. Do you understand? The presiding judge’s intervention is an intervention in this direction. Such a question would constitute an accusation of crime against him. For example: Did you help Salim kill the body? That question is one that imputes an offense to him. That is why I intervene. This is the reason for my intervention. Do you understand? Do not let it be misunderstood. Everything you put out is being taken to other meanings. Let me explain this to you as well.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes. Muhammed. Let us start from the day Narin went missing. Where were you that day? What were you doing? Do you remember?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I woke up at eight. We were distributing invitations. My cousin Uğurcan had a wedding. Around two, two-thirty, the four of us headed toward Mardin Derik. We were going to distribute invitations there. Around two, two-thirty we took the village roads toward Derik. At seven-thirty we took a meal break at the house of my uncle Barış Güran’s mother-in-law. At eight-thirty-five my cousin Devran Güran got word that Narin had gone missing. At eight-thirty we set off from there toward the village. We arrived from Derik to the village in about forty-five minutes to an hour.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And you began search activities?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I searched the village. Then at night there was someone called Uncle Emir. He said he had jinn and so on.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Soldiers, move to that side please. Do not stand around our witness. You as well, come. Come here. We have no issue. Let our witness be comfortable. You are comfortable, right? You are giving your statement of your own free will. Okay. Our duty as the court is to ensure you can give your statement comfortably. Yes. We continue.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I started searching the village. I looked into wells. I opened the closed well and looked. I looked into empty wells. I checked the canal side. I, Uğurcan Güran.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now can you come to the day you found the slipper?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : The day I found the slipper was the second day. The 22nd of the month. We were on the canal bridge. My aunt-in-law called me and said the children were out of milk. I have two nieces/nephews. “Can you buy milk? Do you have a car?” I said yes. I was going to buy milk. I saw the slipper. On the village road. I passed over the slipper from about two and a half kilometers away. There were Gypsies’ tents on the side. I thought it belonged to them. I bought the milk and so on. On the way back I saw the slipper again. I thought, maybe it’s theirs, maybe it isn’t, so I should take it. I showed it to my aunt-in-law.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you drove over the slipper. At first.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : It was in the middle of the road.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Well Muhammed, here is the key point. Here is the matter of debate. Perhaps thousands of people, maybe hundreds, passed along that road. They did not see that slipper but you did. The allegation is this. You have the right not to answer this question. Did you, at the prompting or direction of one of the defendants, place that slipper there and make such a move in order to derail the investigation? Did anyone tell you to place that slipper there, find it, and draw the gendarmerie in that direction?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did Salim, or the others—Nevzat, Yüksel, Enes—give such an instruction?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then what is the reason that you found that slipper there while, as I said, the other defendants and other family members could not?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : Well, it could simply be a coincidence. For example, a car could have passed and a child could have thrown the slipper out of the car. Or it could belong to the Gypsies.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You’re saying, how would I know? I passed and I saw it.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I passed and I saw the slipper. At first I said it must belong to the Gypsies. I passed it by. Then on the way back it was still there. It was in the same place on the way back. I drove over it again. Then I thought, just in case, let me show it to my aunt-in-law. If the slipper is hers, we already know the place. If it is not hers, it is trash anyway. I went to the village. There was a commotion at my uncle’s house. It was very crowded. New cars and so on. The gendarmerie were shouting. Thinking something had happened there, I jumped out of the car and ran straight to the house. “Has something happened?” They said no. They were going to hold a meeting. They were clearing everyone out of the house. A gendarme was shouting. There was a commander shouting. My mother and so on were there. I am against that sort of thing. I said, “Commander, don’t shout, I will clear everyone out.” He said okay. I cleared everyone out of the house. My mother’s maternal aunt is diabetic and cannot walk on her own.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What is your mother’s name?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : İlhan.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : İlhan.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : My aunt Azize helped my great-aunt. They brought her to the stairs. I took her by the legs and carried her down the stairs. Then I said, let me take you to Uncle Salim’s. She said no, take me to Hüseyin Güran’s house, his brother’s. I said okay. “Is there a car?” “Yes, right across.” I put her in the car. I gave the bag to my aunt. My phone was on charge, I asked for it. Then I went to Hüseyin Güran’s house. I took her out of the car; at that moment Osman Güran arrived. “I’m out of cigarettes. Let’s go to the petrol station.” I said okay. We went to the petrol station and bought cigarettes. Then my cousin Uğurcan called. “We’re up on the hill. Come sit for five or ten minutes.” Okay. We went up. Then Osman said, I’m going to the village. Osman said, I’m going to the village. You’ll come. We had two cars by then. I said okay. He got into that car. At that moment, his legs are longer than mine. He adjusted the seat. He noticed the slipper.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : He noticed the slipper. He said, whose slipper is this? Only then did it come to my mind. I said, I found it on the road. “Bring it right away to your aunt-in-law—let’s send it to Baran. Let her show it.” If it is the slipper, we already know the place. If not, it’s trash.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So the reason you forgot the slipper was because they were going to hold that meeting, due to the commotion.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : After that I was never alone. And I had been without sleep for 36 hours.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I had been without sleep for 36 hours. But Muhammed, what do you do for a living?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I am a civil servant. At Trakya University.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : This is a very serious piece of evidence.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I came on Saturday. I came for the wedding. My cousin’s happiness—we were going to celebrate it. Now such a thing happened to us.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What I mean is this: finding the slipper was a big deal that day. If a slipper was found, the search would be directed that way. In this regard, you are a civil servant and also a bright young man. From your answers I understand as much. You can express yourself quite well. The fact that you could forget this came across as a bit odd to us. Perhaps it is because this struck us as odd that you are detained. I am not concerned with why you are detained, but as a court this is the aspect that seems odd to us. When you found the slipper, shouldn’t you have shown it to everyone first?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : Because of the commotion there, I forgot the slipper.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That is the matter.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : Afterwards, since there were always people with me, I couldn’t remember the slipper.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Afterward you found the slipper. Whom did you inform to ask whose slipper it was?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I called Baran; her brother didn’t answer. I called my own brother, Berat Kaya. I said I found a slipper on the road. I’ll send you a photo; show it to my aunt-in-law. If it’s hers, it’s hers; if not, it isn’t. I hung up; Baran called. Narin’s brother. Narin’s brother called. Yes. Baran called; I told him the same thing I had told my brother. Then I sent the photo. Two or three minutes later Baran called. There were screams in the background. He said the slipper is hers. “Where are you? Come to the place by the woods.” Okay. We went there. The commander came. We hadn’t given any statement yet. “Who found it?” “I did.” “Give your number and don’t go anywhere.” Okay. My uncle Arif came over the slipper. He said, “I will take the slipper.” Meaning it is her slipper. We then went to the station, in order to give statements anyway.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So how was it understood that the slipper did not belong to Baran’s sister? Were you at the station at that time?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I was at the station. I went to the station around 10:00–10:30. They released me at 6 p.m. the next day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : During that time, that the slipper was not the girl’s slipper—that it was not Narin’s slipper. You don’t know who said that and so on?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : There was a Petty Officer Bayram.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Not Baran. That it was not Narin’s slipper.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : There was Petty Officer Bayram. He came into the room and said, “Didn’t you notice at all? Would an eight-year-old girl wear size 25 slippers?” I told that commander, “I don’t have a daughter. I have never bought slippers for a little girl. How would I know whether the size is 25 or 31?”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So it was understood in that way that the slipper in question did not belong to the girl, by the size, is that right?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : That is what he said. That is what he told me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The commander said so. The commander said it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes. Let us avoid repetition. Do not go into it. I believe I asked quite detailed questions, but if you did not like my questions, of course you may ask yours. Counsel for Mr. Arif—no questions. Any questions from our Diyarbakır Bar Association attorneys? No. Any from the Ministry of Family? No. From the defendants—Ms. Yüksel, what will you say?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : (Repeats Yüksel’s question) I will summarize. Very well. When the slipper came to me and they said it was a red slipper, I said, yes, it could be my daughter’s slipper. I screamed about this. However, at first nothing about the size of the slipper occurred to us. Then we checked, she said, and that’s the situation. Please, Mr. Prosecutor. Our Prosecutor has a question.​",

    "text": "Trial Prosecutor ​\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I will ask it in a different way without repetition. Let me start from a different angle, then. Around what time did you return from Derik?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : My cousin got a call at 08:30–08:45. I mean, we came from Derik at 180–220.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : The distance is about an hour anyway.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : We reached the village in about forty-five minutes to an hour. That is… Half past… It was around nine-thirty or ten when we were in the village.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Around ten you are recorded as being in the area of Dicle University.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : Correct. I was talking. Another question came up there. It interrupted. It interrupted. Someone called Uncle Emir—our worker. A watchman. Ali Rıza Güran. A worker of my mother’s uncle. A watchman. He has a wire. He says he has jinn. Believing him, he whispers to the wire. He moves the wire. We asked if he could find her. He said he could. He said he was getting a signal. He directed the wire toward the Dicle University faculty side. We went in three cars that way.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Is there a tea garden operated by someone from the Güran family there?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : At… Beylerbeyi Garden. Upstream of the new bridge. Uncle Emir the watchman is already there.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I understand. You do not have to answer this question, but did Salim Güran come there that evening?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : No.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : He did not come.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : No.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : In your statement you have such a sentence about Salim Güran: that he sent Devran and someone to a village with a white Egea, sent his son.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : That was with the commanders, at the bridge.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You say on August 22 he sent Devran and an unknown person to an unknown village.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : On August 22, together with the commanders, together with the commander, someone was sent. My uncle also sent his son. That person next to him was either someone from intelligence or a commander. I do not know who it was. He was sent in that manner. He also gave me the key. Of my uncle Arif’s car. That way I became the driver as well.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Madam President, to you: if that slipper had been there as first visible, everyone would have seen it. On the contrary, I think that slipper was never placed there. That slipper was always with you. Since you found this out—you do not have to answer this—why didn’t you go to the gendarmerie? There is gendarmerie at every step there anyway. Showing this to Yüksel, getting an opinion on whether the slipper belonged to her, and throwing it away—was that within your or your brother’s remit?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : No, not at all. I found the slipper. The gendarmerie are on the road anyway. There was no gendarmerie there, you would throw it away directly. Right there—when I went there, there was no gendarmerie on the road. Everyone was at the house. As I said, there was a very big commotion there. They had all cars moved from there as well. By showing it to my aunt-in-law—anyway the gendarmes were there. It is forensic.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Very well. Thank you, Mr. Muhammed. We move to questions from defense counsel.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Enes Güran ​\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir ​\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : You said, “After the slipper was found, they took me away,” but you did not fully describe that part. We are curious about that as well. What did you experience? What happened?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I found the slipper. They took me to the station at around half past ten. Me, Osman Güran, Uğurcan Güran, Hüseyin Güran, Barış Güran’s son. They put each of us in a separate room. A man from intelligence came in and called me a murderer.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I am intervening at this point. The addressee of these questions is a criminal complaint to the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office. As it will add nothing to the file, I am skipping this question. Explain it, but I have skipped this question.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : The indictment starts with this, you know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We have obtained what we needed. We have heard our witness.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Shall I explain what I asked anyway?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Briefly, of course.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : The indictment starts with the slipper. After the slipper, was the family targeted, was there suspicion, and here he himself alleges he was called a murderer. There are also allegations that, for example, although the girl was missing, the family thought she was dead. These allegations are connected with this. That is why I asked.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : File a criminal complaint regarding this alleged torture. If you have such an allegation.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : They beat me for nine hours. Twenty intelligence officers constantly. Every hour they came and I was beaten.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You may file a criminal complaint on this matter, friends. Do you understand? It is your legal right. You have the right to file a criminal complaint with the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office. Very well.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : What was said was left incomplete. If he could continue explaining.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : They dragged me and called me murderer. “How did you kill? Did you strangle her? Did you crush her head with a stone?” They used such words. Then a commander came. “You are not the murderer. I’ll cut off my member and make myself a woman.” Things like that were said. I said I was in Derik. “No, you were not in Derik. You are the murderer.” They used sentences like that.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Until what time did the night searches continue? On the first night, that is on the 21st, until what time did the searches continue? Until what time were you awake?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I did not stop until the time I found the slipper. Let me put it that way.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : You had not slept at all?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I had slept four hours the previous day. In total I had about 36 hours awake.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : And the scuffle part was, I think, left incomplete, not fully understood. You said there was a commotion. What exactly happened in that commotion? You found the slipper, came back, forgot it. What happened that you forgot?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He explained that well. Go on, explain it once more. I understood it quite well.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : I found the slipper. I came to the village. There was a commotion there. As I said, it was quite crowded. New cars had arrived. Intelligence—I did not know at the time, of course. At that moment I ran straight from the car to the house. The commander was shouting at my mother and so on. “Commander, what happened?” “There is a meeting.” I said, “Do not shout at anyone. I will get whoever is in the house out.” He said okay. Together with my mother we got everyone out. My mother’s sister has diabetes. She cannot walk on her own. My aunt Azize and my mother helped her. She reached the stairs. I held her legs and carried her down. Then I said, let me take you to Hüseyin Güran’s house. The guests were going there as well. “No, take me to Hüseyin’s house,” she said. Okay, I said. I put her in the car. We went to Hüseyin’s house. I took her out of the car. Osman Güran came. “I have no cigarettes. Let’s go to Çarıklı.” Okay, I said. We went to Çarıklı. He bought his cigarettes and so on. My cousin Uğurcan called. “I’m on the hill at the livestock market. Come get some air.” Osman and Hüseyin were with me. “No problem, let them go,” he said. Okay. We went there. We sat for 15–20 minutes. Then Osman said, I will go to the village. There were already two cars. Okay, I said. He got into the car and noticed the slipper. He noticed the slipper. He said, whose slipper is this? I said, I found it on the road. I forgot it. I brought it to the village to show it. I forgot. Since you showed it, it came to mind. I immediately sent a photo to Baran. Then to the bridge area. Intelligence—I don’t know them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, alright. You told the rest. In fact you omitted one thing. You omitted one thing. You told the commander, “I don’t like such things, I’ll handle it.” You forgot to mention that. I meant it in a good way. I said something favorable to you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, okay, I understand.​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : He immediately attacked those clustered houses there. He shouted at the Gypsies, “Where is the girl?” That.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, okay, that’s not what we mean.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Which vehicle was with you?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : The Egea. It was my uncle Arif’s car.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : And you were taken into custody regarding this vehicle. Was the first examination made then?​\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : I understand. Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you. Any other questions? Go ahead, Mr. Onur, counsel for Salim.​",

    "text": "Presiding Judge ​\n\nPresiding Judge : You have the right to refrain from testifying. First of all, this is not a wrong thing. “I wish to refrain from testifying.” You have the right to testify or not to testify. In our view, this does not make you guilty. Alright? Because on one side is your uncle, on the other side your first cousin. You have this right. Do you wish to testify?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I do.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then we will hear you without oath.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Should I tell about the day of the incident?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We will start from the day of the incident and then continue. Mr. Osman, let me remind you again of this point. You have the right not to answer questions that are self-incriminating. I will also intervene on this matter. Because some questions may lead to allegations of praising a criminal, concealing criminal evidence, or harboring a criminal. I also expect sensitivity from our colleagues on this matter. Yes, Mr. Osman, I am listening to you. What are these conversations? Did you meet or speak with Enes? Tell us about the day of the incident.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I only met Enes that day. I met him after she went missing. I realized around seven, seven-thirty in the evening that she was missing. My aunt called out from the path, saying she was missing. At that moment, everyone was there along with Enes. Together with Enes and the villagers, we went out to search. I had not seen Enes earlier that day. Only that day around six, six-thirty in the evening I went in front of my grandfather’s house. I live in the city center. I do not have a house in the village; when I go to the village with my grandfather, I go to my grandfather. I only met Enes that day when we realized she was missing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, you only met Enes that day, when she went missing.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I mean, by “met,” we did not have any conversation. We were only in the same environment.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You were in the same environment. Osman, then you started searching the next day.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : A slipper was found, a red slipper.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Yes, correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : This matter— could you tell us about it as well? I mean, could you describe this incident?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Yes. I was in front of my grandfather’s house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, Osman. What is this slipper matter?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Yes. I was in front of my grandfather’s house. There were guests. It was evening. My cousin Muhammed Kaya drove down in my uncle Arif Güran’s car. Our elderly great-aunt, Fatma Ünsal, got out of the car. He had brought her down from above, from my uncle Arif’s house. Law enforcement had said only the family should remain at Arif Güran’s house. At that time, Fatma Ünsal and the guests were also at my uncle Arif’s house. Seeing that the elderly were standing, in that commotion he brought the elderly down. When he brought them down, I said there was a guest’s car behind my own car. Since you are here, I said, let’s go as far as the Kadoil petrol station. At the entrance to Çarıklı. We went together to the Kadoil petrol station. We bought some things there. Then Muhammed called our cousin Uğurcan. He asked, “Where are you?” He said, “I’m sitting in an open area near the livestock market.” “Alright,” he said. “We’ll come there too. We’ll sit with you for a bit.” When we went there, of course Hüseyin Güran was also in the car. Hüseyin Güran, my uncle Barış’s son.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Then we went there, Your Honor. When I got out of the car, I said to Muhammed: Uğurcan already has a car. There are guests at home. There is no young man to serve them. Let Hüseyin and me return to the village with my uncle Arif’s car. After you two sit for a while, you can come back again. Then he said okay. We got into my uncle Arif’s car. I sat in the driver’s seat. Hüseyin sat next to me. While adjusting the seat to myself, I saw a red slipper in the floor mat tray. I picked it up. I asked, “Whose is this?” Muhammed said, “I went to the market for my nephews and nieces to shop. I picked it up when I came across it along the way. But in that commotion I forgot to mention it when I brought the elderly down.” I then said, “Let’s send it to older brother Baran. It might be Narin’s.” Then to older brother Baran—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I did not understand. Where did Muhammed say he took the slipper from?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : On the way. He picked it up while going along the way.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Well, that day everyone was already looking for a slipper or something. How did he forget this?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Law enforcement had said, while the elderly were up there, to leave my uncle Arif’s house. Only the family should remain. Perhaps they were going to have a talk with the family. He came there after leaving the market, after buying items. When he saw the elderly outside standing, he said, “Come, I’ll take you down.” He put the elderly into the car. He said he forgot it at that moment.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But isn’t it very interesting that he forgot? Did it make sense to you?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : That is what he said.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then did you report this slipper to law enforcement?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Yes. We sent it to older brother Baran via WhatsApp. Baran called us back a minute later. He said it could be Narin’s. Then we said we would go to where Muhammed saw the slipper. We said you can come there as well. We handed the slipper over to law enforcement.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You handed the slipper over to law enforcement.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Muhammed remembered where he found it, right? He took you there. Where he found it. Was it a pair or two pairs?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : It was a single slipper.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He found it there and forgot to mention it. You got into the car and went there. These are the questions we will ask. The Lady Judge has a point that is on her mind. While you were searching, you say “we went to sit,” “Uğurcan,” etc. What is meant by “to sit” or “I was sitting there”? While the whole village is in a mobilized state searching for the girl, what does “to sit” mean?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Not during the sitting. Before the slipper was found, Uğurcan was already sitting in an open area by the livestock market, without us knowing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Which day are you talking about? 21.08 or 22.08?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : It was 3–4 days after the incident, Your Honor. 3–4 days later.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Actually the next day is 22.08. The day you found the slipper is the next day, right?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : It was the third day of the incident exactly. I do not remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That is normal. There is nothing odd about not remembering.​",

But he thought it might belong to Narin. You have such a sentence in your statement. You said you used that road 6 times.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I did not see this slipper.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You have that sentence, right? I remember you gave times— morning, noon, evening— for a road you passed 6 times. Exactly. That neither you in those 6 passes, nor the gendarmerie, nor AFAD saw it. Muhammed says he took it without even getting out of the vehicle— bending from the driver’s door without getting out of the vehicle. Do you remember if he gave you his statement like this? How did he take the slipper?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : He told me this: “I went to the market. It caught my eye when I went. I did not take it. I bought the items. Then on the way back I even drove over the slipper. In fact, I stopped again. When I backed up, I took the slipper. I opened my door and put it on the floor mat.”​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So he says it was in a visible place, and you said you passed there 6 times and the whole village passed there like that.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : If I had seen it, I would have picked it up.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Your Honor, I have another question. Nesrin Güran is your mother, isn’t she? There is a women’s quarrel in which your mother was present. You know that, right? Do you have anything your mother said on this matter? Did you hear anything? Do you have any information about it?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : No.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Was there an insult directed at Yüksel?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : No, my mother was in front of Süveyla Özkan’s house that day. She was not even up there during the quarrel. That is what is said. I did not see it with my own eyes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : No, I was only asking if you had any knowledge.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I— my mother— such a thing— Okay.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Thank you.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : When you spoke with Muhammed, at what time did Muhammed find that slipper?​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : How many hours had passed?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : When he told me, he said half an hour to forty minutes earlier. “I went to the market.”​",

It is toward her house. In other words, there is manipulation here.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Possibly. I would call it not manipulation but interpretation. Yes, as the prosecution it is very fine that you look for faults, but it is not manipulation— it is interpretation. Maybe it was said to Yüksel. Maybe it was said to another woman behind Yüksel. Maybe it was said to Arif. Maybe it was said to Nevzat behind Arif’s house.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When a house is described, generally the man—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Possibly. Possibly. That is yours— your interpretation. The interpretation recorded in the minutes by the prosecution and the Diyarbakır Bar Association— none of it binds us.

    "text": "Defense Counsels for Enes Güran ​\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek ​\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Mr. Osman, how many days were you in custody with law enforcement?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I was with law enforcement for about one day. I was in the lockup for about six or seven days.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Did you encounter ill-treatment, rough beating, behavior that would offend you, discourtesy, severe insult, or any other similar treatment?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Yes, I did. On the day Narin’s body was found, they took all of my family and brought us to the station. At law enforcement, they attempted to put pincers to my teeth and pull out my toenails. Until nighttime, they held us against a bare wall and beat us. We experienced things like that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You experienced torture.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Despite this, why did you not file a complaint?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : As a family, we wanted the culprit to be found. We kept quiet, wondering whether the culprit was truly within our family.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : This would not have contributed to the file anyway— but it’s finished now. Alright. Had it not been, it would not have contributed to the file.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir ​\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : The slipper issue was asked, but let me ask again. Who later determined that the slipper did not belong to Narin?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Law enforcement asked for the size of the slipper. I think they asked the family what size she wore. That is how I remember it. I cannot be precise, but they said it was not her slipper.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That it was not her slipper because the size did not match.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Was it understood in a short time? Or did it take long?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I think it was understood the next day.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Your father’s statement about who determined it was different. Now I will ask this. There is a vehicle with plate number 56.​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : 56 XX 763. It appears on the school’s camera records. It arrives at 18:32. Who was driving this vehicle?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I was.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : It was you. Where did you come from at that time?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I plant all of my grandfather’s fields. At that time, I was in the cotton field to check on the workers. I came from the cotton field to my grandfather’s house.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So you arrived exactly at this time. Then after this time— it says 18:56, but I think it says 59— it was 4 minutes fast. At 18:55, Salim Güran’s car departs from here. Were you there at that time?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Correct. I was in front of the house. My uncle Salim came to our house. He sat. He greeted my aunt Fatma. He greeted my grandfather. He greeted me. We sat. We even talked about cotton. We talked about pesticides and pests. We had our normal conversation. He said he was calling his worker. And he went to the corn field.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So before 18:55, in front of your house— that is, your grandfather’s house— you sat and spoke with Salim. Afterwards, because Ms. Yüksel did not see Narin at home, I think she calls out in your direction. First, rather, toward your grandfather’s house, to Ms. Maşallah. Did you see any of that?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : On the path above, my aunt Yüksel only called out, asking whether Narin was there. We said, “She is not here, we have not seen her.” Then we understood that she was missing.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Then Ms. Yüksel and Enes go down into the village to search. At those moments, were you still there? Did you see them?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : We only encountered my aunt Yüksel once in the village.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : With Enes?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : We encountered Enes up above.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Did Enes have any bruising around his eye?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : I did not see bruising.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So you saw him and did not see any bruising, correct?​\n\n\nOsman Güran : Correct.​",

    "section": "Presiding Judge ​",
    "text": "Presiding Judge ​\n\nPresiding Judge : We are starting the hearing. First, Yüksel is your mother. Enes is your brother, and Salim is your uncle. Because of this, you have the right to refrain from testifying. That is, you have the right not to testify.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I can.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you wish to testify?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You wish to testify. We will hear you without oath under the CMK. Yes, Baran. First, in general, what would you like to say about these events? What did you witness? Let’s hear you.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I don’t know either. How did things happen like this? How did it get here? How did it unfold like this? I have no idea about that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, where are you? What do you do?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I am a heavy machinery operator.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where do you work? You work in Erzurum. In Erzurum.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Başkale, yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where were you on the day of the incident?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I was in Diyarbakır.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You were in Diyarbakır. One moment. When did you learn that our girl Narin was missing?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : It was around 7–8 p.m., I think. My brother Muhammed called me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Muhammed called. Did you notify the gendarmerie as soon as you found out?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I went to the village first.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You went to the village first.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I first went by the mosque. There was a large crowd. From there, without stopping, I went up. To the house area. I asked where Narin was, and so on. Then—I don’t remember exactly—was it 112, what was it, I called. I called to report a missing person, even was it 105?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I called, then we learned about the canal. I mean the canal came to mind because it had cooled down.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s it. Now, after these events, the family allegedly held secret meetings among themselves. That is, meetings among family members. Your uncles—cameras were installed in houses. These are the allegations. What do you say about this?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Your Honor, if there had been a secret meeting, would it have been held in this village? In a way everyone could see? Otherwise, in a hidden place—Diyarbakır is a very big place. And during these events sometimes ministers were coming, visiting the village. When a minister came, they would say empty the house. We would send out all the guests coming from Batman, from Diyarbakır. They would say a minister is coming, they will speak, empty the house. Besides that, we didn’t tell anyone there was a private meeting, nor was there one.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There was no such thing.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I personally did not witness it. If there had been a very private meeting, our house—indeed all the family members’ houses—are not blind spots. If such a highly secret meeting had been held in a way the villagers could see, it wouldn’t have been held in the village.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It wouldn’t have been held in the village. Now, there was also a fight among the women.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I wasn’t there at that moment because they first took me for identification that day. I wasn’t there when the fight happened.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You weren’t there. Alright. Do you have any information about why these women fought, that your uncles tried to silence them?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Your Honor, because there was estrangement and such, everyone was very angry. Everyone was burning inside. At the slightest word, everyone would explode. I myself argued with my family members many times as well. Not about this matter, but because the subject was Narin, at the slightest thing a person would immediately explode. Because of that anger.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So these statements like “You know everything. Don’t make us speak. What did we do anyway, as if the men did it”—are these because of an outburst rather than because they knew something?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I think because of the outburst. I mean I don’t think—pardon me for interrupting, Your Honor—if they had known, I believe they would have told. Because there is an innocent girl at the center.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, for approximately 15–20 days you too were searching. If they had known, would you have gained an impression of that? I tried to ask that yesterday. You know how rumors are heard in a village. Your father received thousands of calls from countless people for hours—“Your daughter is with me” and so on. Did you hear anything like this in the village as well—this girl was killed, buried there; this girl was abducted; so-and-so abducted her; Bahtiyar killed her; Nevzat killed her—before she was found? Did you hear such a thing?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : No, Your Honor. There was no such thing, but this did happen: on the day of the incident, some people in the village said a Syrian—what we call “mırtıp”—a car came to the village that day. When, after she came from the Qur’an course and went up, we said, was she abducted perhaps? Because no thought at all occurred to us that she had died. Since we had nothing of that sort, we said maybe she was abducted by someone. And this wasn’t on the very first day. After three or four days had passed—and, for example, they say there are “sheikhs” and such. There are people with such beliefs. Out of desperation they even consulted them. And 80% of them were saying this: if she had passed away, I would sense it, and so on. They kept giving hope—she is alive; she is being hidden by someone and is alive.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So this red car talk, the Syrians talk, the Gypsies talk—especially what Salim alleges—these are things heard in the village; that is, you hear such things in the village and tell the gendarmerie.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is that so?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Yes, yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Otherwise you did not personally see anything.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : We did not personally witness it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Since you conveyed every piece of information to the gendarmerie, these also came out.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Indeed after I returned, I also said—why don’t we go and surround their area? Why don’t we search their cars? I said it repeatedly. Because, I mean, when one says “Syrian” today, people think…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Not people’s thoughts now. When your sister is missing. On the first day, you had not yet concluded she was dead.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It is quite natural and your human duty to look under every stone. But later these matters were considered suspicious, so we are asking you about this—how did you receive these reports?​",

    "section": "Diyarbakır Bar Association ​",
    "text": "Diyarbakır Bar Association ​\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren ​\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Good morning. I would like to wish everyone in the courtroom a good morning as well. Your Honor, I mentioned something yesterday before the hearing. I will make a brief introduction.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : We couldn’t take the floor before the hearing. Because I want to begin by saying these to Baran. Just like to his mother. Now, while we were questioning yesterday, you were outside. You were outside. You were waiting as a witness at the door. While Salim Güran’s questioning was being conducted, I asked some things. They may be wrong, they may be incomplete. Of course we also respect the right to defense. Our colleagues are there. He said to me, “What are you after?” He asked such a question. More precisely, he reacted to my question like that. First I would like to explain what we are after. Because Baran and I were together in front of the Forensic Medicine Institute. I will come to that as well. Because I felt—and thought—that Baran too was after what I was after. That was my feeling. What am I after? Mr. Arif, please, please, I am also a father. But if I do not say this, if I do not explain this in this courtroom, it seems the dried-up consciences here will not open, will not speak. What am I after? We are people who, with three prosecutors, fourteen staff, and all the prosecutors conducting this investigation, witnessed with three masks a smell we will never forget in our lives—the state to which a child, who has the most beautiful scent in life, was brought. On the fourth day, while I was at this courthouse, do you know what one of the law enforcement officers there said to me? “That smell is still on you,” he said, Your Honor. I will never forget this in my life. That day—do you know what we are after? Today we are fighting against the state to which a child who has the most beautiful scent in life was brought; we are fighting for justice. We will fight no matter what it costs. Even if it costs us our lives, we will fight. I say this here today in this courtroom because yesterday there were those who shouted in this courtroom as well. I state once again: I am the father of three children. I am the father of three girls. I know so well what girls are. May God preserve them—you have five or six boys, you wish for a son. When my wife had her third childbirth, I did not go with her. I didn’t go, thinking it might be because of me. When she went to the doctor’s appointment—now that this one was also a girl—I am so happy. You know, we have that feeling—maybe it’s because of me; we thought the third would be a boy. We have such a sentiment. Look, we say let us also have a son. Why am I telling this, Baran? We were in front of the Forensic Medicine Institute, our prosecutors—three prosecutors—are conducting this investigation; they prepared an indictment, in one way or another, with shortcomings, good or bad. They were going to have you make an identification. I did not allow that identification. I said an elder brother should not see this child in this condition. He should not inhale this smell. Let him remain with the scent of Narin as he knew when she was small, the scent he kissed and smelled every day. You were very insistent on being shown. I came to you outside. I said, Baran, do not see—it’s better. But I am sure you too smelled the scent coming out to the outside, Baran. You smelled it, didn’t you, Baran? You did. That is why—what am I after? I am after those who caused this. The lawyers of the Diyarbakır Bar Association are after this. Sixteen lawyers, alright.​\n\n\nComplainant Arif Güran : He is saying things that are not understood.​\n\n\nDue to raised voices from defense attorneys, representatives of the complainant, relatives of the accused, and audience members, the dialogue could not be transcribed.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Once again, I apologize to the family, believing that the emotional reaction we had regarding Narin stemmed from a human response. If that was the case, I apologize. Now, moving to my question. When we were in front of the Forensic Medicine Institute, we spoke with you about the burial of the body—about Narin’s burial and the need to decide where she would be buried. There was a law enforcement officer present. While sitting there, I asked you: Baran, in general, there is a widespread objection to bringing Narin back to the village for burial. Could she be buried somewhere else? What would you say to such a request? At that point, you were the only family member who was not in custody. I asked what your answer was, Baran. I’d like to hear that answer once again.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : From the beginning, I was going to take Narin to be buried in her own village. That was a fact. Of course, there was public reaction there. I didn’t care about that. Whatever happened, we were going to take her to her own village. But there, the prosecutor said to me, “Where?” He asked me that once or twice. “Where, where,” he said. And at that moment, I said, it’s already decided, but if you like, speak with my father. And they sent me to my father.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m asking you to recall the exact answer you gave me to my question.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Where exactly? Didn’t we discuss this topic with you? You don’t remember?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : No. We had already said we would take Narin to the village.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’d like to remind you of something you said to me.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Maybe you’ll remember. I said, you have uncles outside, elder family members. If you want, consult them. The respected elders of the village are here. I use the term “village” to mean family. After that, you gave me an answer.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : What did I say?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Shall I remind you if you’d like?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Yes, remind me, but I think my answer was about my father and me on this matter…​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said, “No family member other than my father and me will have the right to speak.”​\n\n\nBaran Güran : That’s true. It’s the way it is, brother.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’d like to know what you meant by that.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I’ll tell you, brother. You’re taking this completely out of context.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, no. Not at all.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Brother, let me finish. You’re misunderstanding it. There, I was left completely alone. Even though my family was right outside the door, none of them were allowed inside to support me. You left a brother waiting in front of his sister for maybe more than seven hours and let no one in. I waited alone in front of the Forensic Medicine Institute. I asked for ten family members to be allowed in. You didn’t allow them even though they were at the door. At that point, as a wounded brother—and my mother, as far as I knew, had already been taken in that morning. I knew she wouldn’t be coming there. So I said, my father and I will decide on this matter. It doesn’t concern the other family members.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So in that sense, you meant that as the heads of the family, only you two could decide?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : We didn’t say we are the family elders. We already have elders in the family. What I meant was only this: if you had brought even one of my uncles to stand with me after you left me there for six or seven hours alone…​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said that earlier. When I said go outside to consult, you said that.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : You didn’t let me, brother.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I said we could arrange that. I even said I’d speak to the prosecutors—if you wanted to meet with family outside, I said okay. Now I’ll ask one more thing, Baran, for the sake of revealing the material truth. You came to meet with us at the Bar Association twice. In the first meeting, you said you wanted the whole truth to come out. Whoever did this should be punished. You said even if it’s Nevzat or someone from our family in the village, they should be punished. And, as it wasn’t just the two of us—the board members were there too—I asked you this question, remembering those moments. The power of attorney you give us means that, at the hearing, we’ll sit side by side as complainants, but if this turns into an indictment, since your mother and brother are currently detained, they’ll be across from us. We’ll be questioning them. I asked, do you accept that, Baran? Can you repeat your answer here in the courtroom? I apologize for asking again.​\n\n\nIt was observed that the defense counsel objected to the question without speaking into the microphone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I accept your objection to this question. I’m skipping it, on the grounds that it pertains to a matter between two power-of-attorney relationships.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : There are video recordings included in the case file. We watched them. There are also recordings that were made public. There are conversations between you and your brother in prison. We listened to all of them. In those conversations, you encouraged your brother, told him to stand firm, to stay strong. I respect that. But one thing caught my attention, and I want to ask about it. Your brother keeps asking you about the camera. You say, “Yes, it was found, it’s out.” He says, “There are two people,” and you say, “Yes.” But I didn’t see any such camera footage in the file. Did you actually see this footage somewhere? Because we were working together to uncover the truth. If such footage exists, where did you see it? And how did you come into contact with this evidence that you could bring it before the court?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : First of all, there were tons of false reports circulating on social media. Later, an explanation was made. I saw it on social media. They said there were two dark figures seen on the Kartal Eye camera at the military base area. We thought maybe there were two people. Second, my brother is eighteen years old. He’s never been inside a police station in his life. Same for my mother. They’re not in a position to defend themselves. If you had listened to all of my brother’s conversations, you would understand what I meant. Most likely not all of them were included.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I listened to all of them.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Oh. Then you’d know—I repeatedly said, Enes meant that once the footage came out, everything would be revealed. “We’re happy,” he said. “Hopefully,”—may I finish, brother?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m not asking about your comment. I’m asking whether you had access to such evidence. Did you?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : No, they were false reports on social media.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You saw it on social media.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Yes, and there were also those other videos of me and my father that spread widely. We don’t even know who shared them. After all, we were talking on the phone. Besides, he’s an eighteen-year-old boy and in prison.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That’s not what I’m asking.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : We were just trying to comfort him.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You’re right about that. I’m not criticizing that. I said that already.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : He was told to stand tall, and the reason was this: “Stand tall. God is great.” Because a slander had been thrown upon him. Sooner or later the truth will come out. Just because he’s imprisoned, should we abandon our brother?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That’s not what I asked.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, alright. He gave more than enough of an answer. That’s fine.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Your Honor, that was all I wanted to ask. Thank you. Once again, if I have hurt anyone emotionally or spiritually, I apologize again. Truly, I apologize.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Everyone calm down now. From this point on, we go straight to questions. Otherwise, I’ll do what I mentioned before. It’s something I hate to do, but don’t force me to do it. Let’s continue properly. And let me remind you again, Baran — for self-incriminating questions, I will intervene. You may also say, “I do not wish to answer.” Saying that does not mean you are lying or anything else. Since the entire family has suspect status, I will intervene—but there might be moments I miss something. You have the right not to answer any question, especially self-incriminating ones. That is a clear legal right.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir ​\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Mr. Baran, as far as you remember, on the day of the incident when did you first realize your sister was missing? When did you start searching? Do you remember?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I learned what time she went missing a day or two later. Because—according to the school camera in the village, she was last seen at 3:15. After that, no one saw her. So I only learned this later by relying on the camera footage. It was around the third day of the incident.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Around what time did you start searching? As far as you remember?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : The first day?​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : The first day, yes.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : As soon as I arrived in the village.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : About what time? Can you give an hour, or not?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Toward the evening, I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You don’t remember.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : If I said now, it would be a lie.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Well, at 20:43 on the day of the incident you made a report. You called and said, “We’ve been searching for five hours and can’t find her.” By the time you made the report, had about five hours passed—as far as you recall?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : By the time I learned of it, that much time hadn’t passed. The reason I said that is that in such cases they usually arrive late. I said it on purpose—said she’d been missing for a long time, for many hours—so the necessary personnel would come sooner. Otherwise, if I’m not mistaken, my uncle Kurtuluş was having dinner when my brother called me. From the time I made that call, either an hour had passed or it hadn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : About an hour had passed.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Either it had or it hadn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : But your statement clearly says, “We’ve been searching for five hours and can’t find her.”​\n\n\nBaran Güran : The only reason I said that was just to get them there as soon as possible—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, alright.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Again—have him explain once more.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He explained; I heard it.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Have him explain again.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, no, he already explained it a moment ago.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : If I had said she’d been missing for an hour, they might have said, “Maybe she’s around here somewhere.” With that in mind, I said she’d been missing a long time. That was the purpose.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, you already said that—twice. Counsel may not have heard.​",

    "text": "Ministry of Family and Social Services ​\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz ​\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Baran, what do you think happened to your sister? I was going to connect it to something, but let me ask directly first. What do you think happened? I mean, life is going on as usual—she’s going to Qur’an course, coming back. What do you think could have happened?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : My own view is only this: I think my sister was abducted by this despicable person before she went up the hill—taken away.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Why do you think that, for example? There were many searches.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : He says he was at home at that time, right?​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Okay, but your uncle also says he was at home at that time. And your mother says she was at home at that time.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have the right not to answer this question. It is incriminating.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : I won’t prolong it, as I said, but during the search efforts—your sister was searched for 19 days—strange things happened. There were fires, the power went out, women fought each other, there were inconsistencies. There are gendarmerie records stating they were misdirected during the search. What do you think about this? For example, the gendarmerie says the villagers, led by your uncle, misdirected us. This was recorded and is in the file. Your Honor also asked Salim Güran about it. What do you think? Did you witness anything like that? After 19 days she was found, and the place she was found—a stream—had been searched many times before. There are inconsistencies in the file. For example, Melike changes her statement; Birsen changes her statement; Maşallah changes his statement; Hediye Güran—Hediye changes her statement.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Counsel wants to ask this: were these inconsistent statements made as part of a plan, or were they spontaneous statements?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Your Honor, as I said, my family are not people who have spent their lives giving statements before the police, prosecutors, or judges. It’s quite normal for them to mix things up. They weren’t raised in an urban environment. They all grew up in the village. Why does no one take that into account?​\n\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun ​\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : There is a prison visit with Enes. He tells you, “Narin used my toothbrush.” He asks if anything would come out. What was he afraid would be found?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : From this we see that the boy doesn’t really understand. DNA might truly be on Enes’s toothbrush. Why? When you say DNA—since I’m not very knowledgeable about this—I would also think of that. Did she last use my toothbrush in her mouth, or—for example, I even asked, I last kissed Narin. Is that what they mean as DNA? That’s the idea.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s the idea.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : He keeps asking whether the report has arrived.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Because he was curious. He wanted it to come as soon as possible. You probably didn’t fully read that conversation. You didn’t listen.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Did Enes have a tendency toward violence or substance use? Have you ever witnessed anger control problems?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : In no way. I can say this plainly. You can tell the entire village: Enes is the one who never fights with anyone in the village.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : He was biting his own arm. He punched himself in the face.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : He lost his sister. Isn’t that normal?​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : But you didn’t do that.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I banged my head against the wall. Did you see me? I smashed my phone against the wall—did you see that? They generally don’t take reports for those kinds of things.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Emine Akçalı ​\n\nLaw. Emine Akçalı : We heard your mother yesterday. She didn’t give very enlightening information. My question is this: do you think your mother is protecting your uncle, or is she protecting Enes?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You also have the right not to answer this question. It implies harboring a criminal and tampering with evidence.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : My mother doesn’t protect anyone.​\n\n\nLaw. Emine Akçalı : Did you decide to do this on your own?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : On my own judgment.​\n\n\nLaw. Emine Akçalı : Yes, you’re 20 anyway.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : 21.​\n\n\nLaw. Emine Akçalı : Had you ever asked before—why they didn’t report it, or whether you knew they hadn’t reported it?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I don’t know about the incident itself—whether they searched or not—but in the panic of such a situation, it’s normal for a person not to think of that. You get flustered and just start searching.​\n\n\nLaw. Emine Akçalı : Yes. We asked family members yesterday about Nevzat. What do you think? He didn’t leave a very good impression on us, in the eyes of the family. Because Nevzat and his wife said they were friends with your uncle. But your family members and your uncle said there was absolutely no such thing. I wanted to ask about Nevzat.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : A long time.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Watch your words. Don’t use insulting or offensive language, alright?​\n\n\nLaw. Emine Akçalı : Were they only friends? Eating and drinking together…​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I knew they hadn’t spoken for a long time. Before that, it was normal—they were neighbors after all, it’s a village. You see each other at weddings and such. Just normal village relations. As for Nevzat’s family members—you said so. As for why Nevzat mostly says, “I don’t know, I don’t remember,” why do people react so strongly…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We’ll evaluate that, Baran. That’s our job. It’s my job. Alright. That’s for the court panel to assess. Alright.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Baran, is Narin the same age as Nevzat’s grandchild? Do you know anything about that?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : His granddaughter—Fadile’s daughter—they’re about the same age, I think.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsels for Yüksel Güran ​\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu ​\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Right before the incident, did you hear that Nevzat gave Narin some allowance money?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I heard it a few times in the village. Even villagers were swearing about it. I don’t remember exactly who, but they said despite having four or five kids, he only gave money to Narin.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Only to Narin.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Only to Narin.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You heard this from villagers. Yes. Like when you said you heard about the Gypsies—from villagers, right?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : But I think it was my uncle Barış’s daughter who said it, as far as I remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Your uncle Barış’s daughter said that?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : She’s young too, one of Narin’s close friends. Alright, I don’t remember exactly though.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I’m just asking out of curiosity, by name.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : So, among that group of kids, he gave money only to Narin, right? Yes. Thank you. Now, was there any tension or argument between your father and Nevzat over a vehicle transaction? Did you witness anything?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Yes, I did. I was there.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : What happened?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : There was some damage. My father explained it calmly to Nevzat at first, saying there’s this issue. He supposedly said he was afraid of us—people say that. Then in my uncle’s house, he raised his voice and said, “I won’t pay, I don’t accept it.” Then my father said, “You’re saying that?” He called two older men from the village—said, “Come, you’re elders, you decide.” Nevzat began stammering there, saying, “I don’t know.” Then my father got angry. He said, “I won’t hit you, but you will pay this money.” They argued there. I was going to step in, but my father stopped me.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Did you say anything to him?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : No, I didn’t. But I was about to react, because he was speaking disrespectfully to my father. When my father reacted, I stayed silent and left.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Do you think Nevzat could have done this to Narin because of that argument?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : He could have. Because, let me put it this way: he is so cold-blooded, so calm—as if he’s committed fifty murders—acting as though nothing happened.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Alright, thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you. Alright, next please.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş ​\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Mr. Baran, the day after little Narin disappeared, your aunt’s son Muhammed Kaya found a slipper. A photo of this slipper was sent to you. He asked you to show it to your family. Can you tell us what you know about this slipper incident?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : We were at home, sitting on the balcony. Around that time, it was either Muhammed or Osman—I’m pretty sure it was Muhammed—he sent me a picture. He said, “Look at this slipper, we found it on the road. Show it to your mother to see if it’s hers or not. Could it belong to Narin or not?” I showed it to my mother. My mother said, “That’s Narin’s slipper.” We immediately jumped up. We went straight to where the Gypsies were. The military personnel had surrounded the whole area. We started searching there.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Yes. Also, we want to ask this: you said you hurt yourself when you learned about the incident, and your brother Enes hurt himself by biting his arm and hitting his face. Did any of your other siblings hurt themselves too? I mean, did any of them throw things, or break down emotionally—so upset they didn’t know what they were doing? Anyone?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Osman broke his phone. I broke glasses several times. Honestly, I even hit my head against the wall more than once.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Of course, because of the shock of the event.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Because of the shock. I broke my own phone too. Just so my mother wouldn’t be upset. Even before this man was handed over, I would get up at night, go to the roof, and cry alone—so no one would hear, so my mother and father wouldn’t be upset. They’re very attached to us. That’s why I hurt myself during those times.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Baran, you said Nevzat gave money. You said Nevzat is very cold-blooded, could commit a murder, and go on with life as if nothing happened. Why didn’t you suspect him when he gave that money then?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Because, Your Honor, it’s a village environment. For example, even now, if someone in the village gave some money to my younger sibling, I wouldn’t be surprised.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Right. You wouldn’t be surprised. Quite normal.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Everyone is like an uncle in the village. Our village has a large population.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And I wasn’t surprised either. That’s why I didn’t focus on it much—until you said he’s very cold-blooded, could commit murder, and act like nothing happened. That’s why I’m asking you now. Normally, I wouldn’t find the money thing strange. Sometimes we say, “You survived trouble today.” In our religious belief, giving charity averts misfortune. Maybe he thought, “Let me make a few children happy today so misfortune will pass.” That’s from our belief. But since you said he’s that cold-blooded, that’s why I’m asking you this now. Notice, I didn’t ask such a question at first.​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Yes, that’s right, Your Honor. He himself said in his statement that it was the first time he committed a murder. I mean, how can a person not panic? How can a person not be afraid? How could he come every night, sit with my father, drink tea with us?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But Baran, he doesn’t say, “I committed a murder.” He says, “I destroyed the body.”​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I think he’s lying, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Of course, let’s proceed. You may introduce yourself and ask your question.​",

When did you see Enes on the day of the incident?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : I came in the evening that day. I don’t remember exactly what time because everything was hectic—he came to the hospital. That day, there was a report of a child resembling Narin at the public hospital—an unattended child. I clearly remember that part, but not the rest.​\n\n\nLaw. Recep Kızılok : Did Enes seem anxious or panicked? Did you sense anything unusual?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : We were crying together.​\n\n\nLaw. Recep Kızılok : You were crying together. Did you notice any bruises on his face or bite marks on his arm?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Recep Kızılok : You didn’t notice anything, right? Okay, thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Your Honor, since we are last to ask questions, for the sake of fairness, could the defense begin first next time?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Agreed. You’ll go first next.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : I’ll ask a question related to the previous one. We learned that Enes went to the hospital that day. The court requested the CCTV footage from Memorial Hospital. The hospital sent only one camera recording. And we had some bad luck again—like everything else. As we explained yesterday, there are several cameras viewing that area. But no time synchronization was done between those cameras.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, direct your question.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir ​\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Yes, the question. In this footage, is the person shown his father?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Go ahead. You may approach the witness. Yes, come closer—you can ask near the witness. We placed the microphone there; don’t misunderstand. Counsel, please move here. Yes, here.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : He already said—it was his father.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I didn’t hear. Ah, let me show you too. May I have the photo? Yes. He has the CCTV footage from Memorial Hospital. The family members haven’t seen it. Alright. The defense counsel asked whether the person in the ambulance footage from Memorial, wearing a white t-shirt, was his father. Baran said it was his father. Yes. In the court’s viewing, the person in question was observed to resemble Arif Güran. Proceed.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Did Enes have any bruises around his eyes that day?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : No, I didn’t see any.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Salim Güran ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : There’s a rumor that Ali Rıza Güran made a settlement offer to the Bahtiyar family on your behalf. Did you or your family, or your father, ever ask Ali Rıza Güran to do such a thing? Did you talk to him about it? Or is he someone who could do such a thing?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : My sister would never do something like that.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Alright. After the incident, what was Salim Güran’s mental state like? Was he sad, emotional? Did you ever suspect him? Did he take an active part in the search efforts?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Salim Güran is my uncle. During that period, he was with the gendarmerie 24/7. He’d often come back at four in the morning. He was out at dawn, and we’d search together until evening. The gendarmerie never left his side.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Had Salim Güran ever hit Enes before? I mean before the incident. Being his uncle, maybe if Enes misbehaved—had he ever hit him?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : If he misbehaved, an uncle’s scolding is normal. He’s an uncle after all. But I personally never saw it.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So does Salim Güran have a habit of hitting his nephews? Does he hit them?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : God is my witness, no.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Now, let’s imagine this: there are three men in a room, and it’s said that your uncle was with your mother. Because of that relationship, your sister Narin is killed. You know Enes—how would he react to his uncle in that situation?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : He would have shot him in the head. If he’d had a gun, he’d have shot him in the head.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Besides that, would Enes ever protect his uncle—hide him—even though his sister was killed?​\n\n\nBaran Güran : Never. If Enes had seen Salim Güran and Nevzat there, even without a gun, he would have stabbed them.​",

Sabah erken kalktığını, tarlaya sulamacılarıyla birlikte gittiğini ve çalıştığını belirtmiştir. Kendini bildi bileli çiftçi olduğunu ve oturduğunu değil, çalıştığını vurgulamıştır. Saat 10-11 gibi eve geldiğini, çocuklarıyla birlikte Diyarbakır Bağlar Sağlık Ocağı’na düğün için elbise almaya gittiklerini söylemiştir. Dönüşte Opet’ten TRY 200 yakıt aldığını ve köye saat 02:45-02:50 civarında vardıklarını belirtmiştir. Evde yemek yedikten ve yaklaşık 1 saat 20 dakika dinlendikten sonra tekrar sondaja gittiğini, burada iki elektrikçiyle karşılaştığını ve amcasının oğlunun trafosundaki arıza nedeniyle onlara yardım ettiğini ifade etmiştir. Bu sırada pamuk tarlasında dolaşarak pamukların kurtlandığını fark ettiğini ve amcasının oğlunu arayarak ilaçlaması gerektiğini söylediğini anlatmıştır. Elektrikçilerin arızayı 3500 TL’ye yapmayı kabul ettiğini, Miran oğlunu da alıp eve saat 18:00 civarında döndüğünü belirtmiştir.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Salim Güran’ın mahkeme ifadesine dayalı olay günü rutini.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaat\nOlay\n\n\n\n\nSabah erken\nSalim Güran kalkar, sulamacıdan bahseder, tarlaya gider.\n\n\n10:00 - 11:00\nEve döner.

Miran’ı arabadan indirip aracıyla şüpheli aracı kontrol etmeye gittiğini, bu sırada Nevzat Bahtiyar’ı gördüğünü ancak selam vermeden geçtiğini, çünkü iki buçuk aydır onunla konuşmadığını ve aralarında “Arif olayı” nedeniyle bir kırgınlık olduğunu belirtmiştir. Narin’in kaybolduğunu ise Hüseyin amcasının yanındayken, saat 06:30-06:40 civarında Ramazan Atasoy’dan gelen telefon üzerine, ancak tam olarak Gizem kızının kendisini arayıp “Baba Narin kaybolmuş” dediğinde öğrendiğini ifade etmiştir. Narin’in kaybolduğunu öğrendiğinde, herkesten önce Şakir Başçavuş’u aradığını ve durumu bildirdiğini söylemiştir (Saat 20:18).",

    "section": "Mahkeme Başkanı’nın Soruları ve Odak Noktaları ​",
    "text": "Mahkeme Başkanı’nın Soruları ve Odak Noktaları ​\nMahkeme Başkanı, Salim Güran’ın ifadesindeki bazı kritik noktalara odaklanmış ve çelişkileri yüzüne vurmuştur:\n\nTelefon Ses Kayıt Programı: Salim’in telefonunda bulunan ve arayanları kaydeden bir programı neden indirdiği sorulduğunda, unutkanlık nedeniyle toplantı saatlerini ve adreslerini kaydetmek için kullandığını belirtmiştir. Ancak Mahkeme Başkanı, Narin’in kaybolduğu gece (22 Ağustos 2024, saat 00:31) bu programın devre dışı bırakıldığını ve bunun şüpheli bir hareket olduğunu vurgulamıştır. Salim ise programı kendisinin silmediğini veya devre dışı bırakmadığını, anlamadığını iddia etmiştir. Bu programı kayınbiraderinin oğlu Şeyhmuz Kaya’nın yüklediğini ve şebeke çekmediği zamanlarda kayıt yapmadığını ona söylediğini belirtmiştir.\nTelefon Görüşmeleri ve WhatsApp Geçmişinin Silinmesi: Mahkeme Başkanı, Salim’in telefonundaki görüşmeleri ve WhatsApp geçmişini neden sildiğini sormuştur. Salim, hayat kadınlarıyla ve eskortlarla görüştüğü için sildiğini itiraf etmiştir. Ancak Mahkeme Başkanı, bazı eskort mesajlarının hala durduğunu, asıl silinmesi gerekenlerin silinmediğini ve rutin konuşmaların silinmesinin şüpheli olduğunu belirtmiştir. Salim, bu silmelerin ayrıca Arif kardeşinin ahırında Keleş mermisi yakalanması ve arama tarama faaliyetleri nedeniyle de yapıldığını eklemiştir.\nNarin’i Kimin Öldürdüğü ve Şüpheleri: Salim’e Narin’i kimin öldürdüğü sorulduğunda, “Ben görmemişim kim öldürdü” cevabını vermiştir. İlk başta üvey annesinden şüphelendiğini, çünkü bir üfürükçünün onun evinin etrafında bir şeyler olduğunu söylediğini belirtmiştir. Mahkeme Başkanı, inanmadığı bir üfürükçünün sözüne dayanarak üvey annesinden şüphelenirken, yaklaşık 15-20 gün boyunca Nevzat’tan şüphelenmediğini ve neden daha önce bunu dile getirmediğini sorgulamıştır. Salim ise Nevzat ile aralarında küçük bir “musibet” olduğunu jandarmaya söylediğini belirtmiştir.\nTanıkları Yönlendirme İddiası: Mahkeme Başkanı, Salim’in amcasının kızları Birsen ve Melike’ye Narin’i saat 17:40’ta gördüklerini söylemeleri yönünde telkinde bulunup bulunmadığını sormuş, Salim ise “Asla. Hepsinin ifadesini döverek değiştirmişler” diyerek reddetmiştir. Mahkeme Başkanı, jandarmanın neden özellikle Salim’e suç isnat etmek için tanıkları dövdüğünü sorgulamıştır.\nKolluk Kuvvetlerini Yönlendirme: Salim’in, jandarmayı sürekli olarak şüpheli yerlere (çingeneler, kırmızı araba, Suriye çadırı gibi) yönlendirdiği tutanaklara geçmiştir. Salim bunu reddederek, duyduğu söylentileri aktardığını, kendisinin görmediğini veya bilerek yönlendirmediğini belirtmiştir.\nHTS Baz Verileri ve Olay Yeri: Mahkeme Başkanı, HTS (baz istasyonu) verilerine göre Salim’in saat 15:19’da Arif Güran’ın evinin çevresinde, 15:20’de ise eve girdiğinin iddia edildiğini belirtmiştir. Salim bunu reddederek, kendisinin mısır tarlasında olduğunu ve evin yakın olduğu için bazın oradan sinyal vermiş olabileceğini söylemiştir. Ayrıca, baz verilerine göre Narin’in cansız bedeninin bulunduğu yere olay gecesi saat 22:47’den 22:55’e kadar gittiğinin iddia edildiğini ve bunun şüpheli olduğunu vurgulamıştır. Salim ise kesinlikle oraya gitmediğini, köyden çıkmadığını ve bu iddiaların kendisine atılan bir “kumpas” olduğunu savunmuştur.\nAraçtaki DNA İzi: Mahkeme Başkanı, Salim’in arabasının şoför koltuğunun altında Narin’e ait DNA bulunduğunu belirtmiştir. Salim, bu arabanın kendisine ait olmadığını, yeğeninin olduğunu ve birçok kişinin, özellikle de çocukların bu arabayı kullandığını söyleyerek DNA’nın oraya nasıl gelmiş olabileceğini açıklamıştır. Ayrıca Narin’in ağzından çıkan köpüklerin eline bulaşıp arabaya silme ihtimali sorulduğunda “Kesinlikle yok öyle bir şey” diyerek reddetmiştir.",

Salim bunu kabul etmemiştir.\nTerlik Olayı: Savcı, Narin’in kaybolduğu ertesi gün Muhammed Kaya’nın Suriyeli çadırının orada bir terlik bulduğunu ve bu terliği bir buçuk saat arabada sakladığını belirterek, bu işi Salim’in ayarlayıp ayarlamadığını sormuş, Salim “Kesinlikle böyle bir şey yoktur. Benimle ilgisi yok” diye yanıtlamıştır.\nCeset Bölgesi ve Kanıt Ekleme: Savcı, Salim’in gece 22:44’te Narin’in cansız bedeninin bulunduğu yerden baz sinyali verdiğini ve jandarma ve AFAD’ın gelmesinden sonra olay büyüyünce, Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın koyduğunu söylediği tek taşın üzerine kalan iki taşı ve çalı çırpıyı ekleyen kişinin kendisi olup olmadığını sormuştur. Salim bunu şiddetle reddederek, dere yatağının uzun olduğunu ve 8 kez aranan yerde cesedin bulunmamasının kendisinin gidip bulmasının imkansız olduğunu söylemiştir.\nAraçtaki DNA Uyumluğu: Savcı, araçtan çıkan DNA’nın Narin’in kıyafetlerinden çıkan DNA ile uyumlu olduğunu vurgulayarak cümlenin derinliğini anlamasını istemiştir. Salim, Narin’in o gün arabaya binmediğini ve arabanın başkaları tarafından da kullanıldığını tekrarlamıştır.\nZaman Çelişkileri: Salim’in Hüseyin amcasının yanından ayrılış saati ile okul kamerasına yakalanma saati arasındaki 30 dakikalık fark (Ramazan Atasoy’un aramasından sonra hemen çıkmadığı iddia edilmiştir) sorgulanmıştır.",

Aydın Özdemir ​\n\nKamera Tespiti: Salim’in oğluna köydeki kameraların yerlerini tespit etmesini neden söylediği ve bu bilgileri jandarmaya teslim edip etmediği sorulmuştur. Salim, herkese bu talimatı verdiğini ve bilgileri jandarmaya ilettiğini belirtmiştir.\nKaybolma Saati: Salim’in telefon görüşmelerinde Narin’in kaybolma saatinin (15:30-16:00) daha erken olarak geçmesi sorgulanmıştır. Salim, bunu hatırlamadığını ve söylentilere dayandığını belirtmiştir.\nÇingene Bilgisi: Çingenelerin Narin’i kaçırmış olabileceği bilgisini nereden edindiği sorulmuş, Salim hatırlamadığını söylemiştir.\nNevzat ile İlişki: Salim’in, Nevzat ile iki buçuk aydır konuşmadığı iddiaları ile Arif ve Gazal’ın “kardeş gibiydiler” ve “birlikte aradılar” şeklindeki beyanları çelişkili bulunmuştur.\nTelefon Görüşmeleri: Mehmet Şerif Güran ve Nevzat Bahtiyar ile olay saatlerine yakın yapılan yoğun görüşmelerin içeriği ve zamanlaması sorgulanmıştır. Salim, Mehmet Şerif ile tarla ve elektrikçi konusunu, Nevzat ile ise su meselesini konuştuğunu yinelemiştir. Elektrikçilerin sabah aramamasına rağmen kendisiyle öğleden sonra görüştüğünü iddia etmesi çelişki olarak belirtilmiştir.\nWhatsApp Silme Nedenleri: Mermi bulunması ve hayat kadınları gibi iki farklı silme nedeninin hangisinin doğru olduğu sorulmuş, Salim “İkisi de doğrudur” demiştir.\nAlışveriş Sonrası Dinlenme: Salim’in alışveriş sonrası yemek yiyip dinlendiği yönündeki beyanının daha önceki ifadelerinde yer almaması sorgulanmıştır.\nTelefon Şifresi ve Eşinin Telefon Kullanımı: Eşinin telefonunu kurcalayıp kurcalamadığı ve eskort görüşmelerini görme endişesi sorulmuş, Salim şifre koyduğunu ve eşinin nadiren telefonunu kullandığını belirtmiştir.\n\n\n\nAv. Derya Yıldırım ​\n\nGiysi Değiştirme: Salim’in daha önceki savcılık ifadesinde eve geldikten sonra üstünü değiştirdiğini belirtmesine rağmen, mahkemede bunu reddetmesi ve aynı elbiseyle tarlaya gittiğini söylemesi çelişkili bulunmuştur.\nDavetiye Dağıtım Toplantısı: Düğün davetiyeleri için yapılan görev dağılımı toplantısının yeri (Erhan ağabeyin evi) ve katılımcıları teyit edilmiştir.\nDSİ Kanalına Yönlendirme: Köyde daha önce çocuk boğulma vakası olup olmadığını bilmediği halde, Salim’in neden jandarma ekiplerini doğrudan DSİ kanalına yönlendirdiği sorulmuştur. Salim, köpeklerin oraya gittiğini ve yetkilileri arayarak suyu kestirdiklerini söylemiştir.\n“Cihaz” Konuşması: Ramazan Atasoy’un tarladaki bir cihaz için kendisini aradığı yönündeki Salim’in beyanına rağmen, Ramazan’ın böyle bir konuşma yapmadığını belirtmesi çelişki olarak öne sürülmüştür.\n\n\n\nAv. Nahit Eren ​\n\n“Fıskiye” Konuşması Düzeltmesi: Ramazan Atasoy ile olan Kürtçe konuşmanın tercümesindeki “fıskiye” ifadesinin aslında “bendin orada taşların orada bir şeyin düşmüş” şeklinde olduğunu, bunun muhtemelen kaçak elektrik için kullanılan bir alet olduğunu ve Narin ile ilgili bir sohbet olmadığını belirtmiştir.\nKurgusal Alibi İddiası: Avukat, Salim’in tüm savunmalarında kendini olay saati dışında bir yerde gösterecek bir “kurgu” içinde olduğunu, olay gününe ait bazı eylemlerini (örn. Hüseyin’lerin evine gitme, kızlarını Uzunbahçe Köyü’ne bırakma) önceki tarihlere (19 veya 20 Ağustos) kaydırdığını iddia etmiştir. Salim, gözaltı süresince baskı altında olduğunu ve uykusuz bırakıldığını, bu nedenle beyinlerinin doğru çalışmadığını savunmuştur.\nEvden Çıkış Saati ve Baz Verileri: Salim’in evden çıkış saatiyle ilgili çelişkiler (02:52’de baz verilerine göre Arif’in evinin aralığında olması, eşinin yemek yedikten sonra hemen çıktığını söylemesi) ve Dilek/Rezan ile ev içinde yapılan telefon görüşmelerinin HTS kayıtlarında görünmesi sorgulanmıştır. Salim bu görüşmeleri hatırlamadığını belirtmiştir.\nArama Faaliyetleri ve Cesedin Yeri: Salim’in Eğertutmaz Deresi’ndeki arama faaliyetlerine katılımı ve Narin’in bulunduğu yeri bilip bilmediği sorgulanmıştır. Salim, dereye aramaya gitmediğini, sadece suyun kesildiğini bildiğini ve cesedin yerini bilmediğini söylemiştir.\nOlay Yeri Gece Ziyareti: Baz istasyonlarının kendisini gece olay yerinde gösterdiği iddiasını tekrar reddederek, “Baz nedir bilmiyorum ama ben gitmemişim” demiştir.\nDilek’ten Kayıp Haberi: Salim’in, kızından Narin’in kaybolduğunu duyduğunda verdiği tepkinin ses kaydı (Mehmet Şirin ile köye gitme talimatı) dinletilmiş ve tepkisinin yeterince şaşkınlık içermediği ima edilmiştir. Salim, sonrasında “Lütfen susmak istiyorum” diyerek cevap vermeyi reddetmiştir.",

Mustafa Demir (Enes Güran Müdafi) ​\n\nWhatsApp Verilerinin Geçersizliği: Avukat Demir, dosyaya giren “silinen WhatsApp verileri” belgesinin aslında hatalı olduğunu, HTS kayıtlarının kopyalanıp üzerine 2 saat 38 dakika 27 saniye eklenerek oluşturulduğunu iddia etmiştir. Bu listenin WhatsApp aramaları olmadığını, hatta DEPSAŞ gibi 444’lü hatların WhatsApp üzerinden aranamayacağını belirterek, iddianamenin “algılarla” hareket ettiğini vurgulamıştır.\nMısır Tarlası ve Ceset Yeri: Harita üzerinde Narin’in cansız bedeninin bulunduğu yer ile Salim’in HTS kaydına göre bulunduğu iddia edilen 135 dönümlük mısır tarlasının uzaklığını göstermiş, geniş bir alanda olmanın ceset yerine gitmek anlamına gelmediğini savunmuştur.\nAskeri Üs Kamerası: Köydeki askeri üs kamerasının köyü “ayna gibi” gördüğünü ve Narin’in kaybolduğu saatlerdeki görüntülerin incelenmesi halinde gerçeğin ortaya çıkacağını, ancak bu kayıtların incelenmediğini veya istendiğini belirtmiştir.\n\n\n\nAv. Onur Akdağ (Salim Güran Müdafi) ​\n\nWhatsApp Arama Kayıtları İddiasının Sahte Olduğu: Avukat Akdağ, Savcılığın “WhatsApp arama kayıtlarını geri getirmesine yönelik resmi belgenin sahte olduğunu” iddia ederek, HTS kayıtlarının manipüle edildiğini tekrarlamıştır. Bu durumun, “savcılık makamının müvekkil aleyhine kati surette tartışmasız bir kanıt elde edemeyince resmen suç delili uydurmuş olması” anlamına geldiğini belirtmiştir.\nNevzat ile İlişki ve Medya Etkisi: Salim’in Nevzat ile çapkınlık veya kadınlar hakkında konuşmadığını, Nevzat’ın ifadelerinin medya (özellikle Didem Arslan’ın programı) etkisiyle 9 Eylül’den sonra Salim ve Yüksel aleyhine değiştiğini, bunun Nevzat’ın “dersini çalışması” olduğunu öne sürmüştür.\nAraçtaki DNA ve Camlar: Narin’in zaman zaman Salim’in eski, Fuat Güran’a ait olan ve birçok çocuğun bindiği arabaya binmesinin normal olduğunu, bu durumun DNA’nın varlığını açıklayabileceğini belirtmiştir. Ayrıca, Nevzat’ın Narin’i “sağ camdan aldım” demesine rağmen, arabanın sağ arka camının bozuk olduğunu belirterek, Nevzat’ın ifadesiyle çelişki olduğunu vurgulamıştır.",

Savunması, olay günü rutinini detaylandırarak bir alibi sunmaya, HTS ve WhatsApp verilerinin manipüle edildiğini iddia etmeye ve diğer suçlamaların baskı altında alınmış ifadeler veya söylentilere dayandığını belirtmeye odaklanmıştır. Müdafiler, özellikle WhatsApp veri raporunun güvenilirliğini sorgulayarak ve askeri üs kamerası gibi dış kanıtların incelenmesi talebinde bulunarak Salim’in masumiyetini desteklemeye çalışmışlardır. Mahkeme heyeti ve diğer avukatlar ise Salim’in ifadelerindeki tutarsızlıkları ve kendi lehine olanları hatırlayıp aleyhine olanları inkar etme eğilimini sürekli olarak vurgulamıştır.",

    "text": "Evaluation of the Concrete Case ​\nIn the evaluation of the concrete case, it was understood from the reports made on 08/21/2024 that the deceased Narin had gone missing, after which all the means of our State were mobilized and search efforts were initiated, and while the search activities were ongoing, at around 08:30 on 09/08/2024 during a sweep conducted by the Gendarmerie Underwater Search and Rescue officers within the Eğertutmaz creek located in the Tavşantepe Neighborhood, upon reaching the coordinates 37 SFB 06008-89639, a sack was seen in the part where the Eğertutmaz creek joins the soil, wedged under rocks and covered by three stones of 40–50 cm in diameter so as to conceal it, the mouth of the sack was tied with a red string yet it was understood that a part of a body was protruding, and upon subsequent checks the lifeless body of Narin GÜRAN was reached inside the sack, and it was understood that Narin Güran had been killed.\nIn the final report prepared by the First Specialization Board of the Council of Forensic Medicine (CFM) following the external and internal examination and autopsy performed on the deceased Narin GÜRAN’s body and the pathological analyses conducted on the internal organ samples taken, it was stated, by unanimous opinion, that “The child’s death occurred on 08/21/2024, that there was no medical evidence indicating death by a traumatic effect other than closure of the mouth and nose and neck compression causing asphyxia, and that the child’s death occurred due to being deprived of oxygen as a result of closure of the mouth and nose and pressure on the neck.”\nIt is known to everyone that the deceased Narin Güran was last seen on the school camera at 15:15:14 (the said time is approximately 4 minutes ahead of the current time), after which she left her group of friends to go home and headed toward the place referred to as the footpath. This is also established by the camera recording in the file and the statements of the friends who were with Narin at that moment.\nOur court conducted inquiries as to where the deceased Narin Güran went last and where she was found, and sought to enhance the DARAN-2 footage in the file on this matter. In line with the request of the complainant Arif Güran and the defense counsel of the defendants to include the DARAN-2 footage in the file and the defense counsel’s request to send the said video to the National Criminal Bureau (UKB) for enhancement and to obtain a report, the relevant video was sent to the UKB and a report was obtained. As stated in the report, 1.5 minutes after the last time seen on the school camera, there is a moving dark figure on the footpath in the direction of the house-stable, and this figure could be the deceased due to the clothing elements being dark in color and the figure being perceived as short and thin; it was also stated that there was a moving black element in the lower part of the stable. It was observed that the report stated that the said movement was not a pixel artifact but a real, live movement. In light of this, our court accepted that the relevant dark figure was a live, real human movement. Therefore, given that the examination in the report indicates that this figure moved toward the stable and the house area and then the moving element disappeared, and considering this finding consistent with the school camera, our court found it established that the deceased Narin, after taking the footpath, went toward the house and the stable, which is an annex of the house."

    "text": "Evaluation of the Evidence ​\nOur court’s evaluation of the evidence in the file is as follows;\nAs a result of the investigations conducted by the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, a public case was filed before our court against the defendants, and it was understood that a separate investigation was conducted regarding the witnesses heard by our court, that the relevant investigation is still pending, and that a restriction order exists on the file. Upon the requests by the defendants and their defense counsel to incorporate the said file into this file, when this matter was inquired of the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, it was observed that there was a restriction order in the file and that, therefore, the investigation file could not be provided within this file. The witnesses were also heard by our court, and it was observed that they did not possess information that could affect the merits in the concrete case. Only the witness Hediye stated that she was at home at the time of the incident. This matter will be evaluated in detail below. Apart from this evaluation, when all other witness statements heard are examined, it is understood that they do not contain any concrete statements that would affect the killing of the deceased Narin.\nIt was observed that in her statements at various stages, the witness Hediye persistently stated that she was at home at the time of the incident, that Narin never came home, that the defendant Salim and the defendant Nevzat also never came to the house, and that the defendant Enes was sleeping at home. The child Muhammed Emre, who was also at home during the incident, was heard as a witness by our court; it was intended to hear the witness Eren, but because he caused a disturbance while waiting his turn in the Forensic Interview Room (FIR) and due to his age, it was decided not to hear him, and the video recording containing the statements taken during the investigation stage was played in the courtroom.\nWhen these witness statements are examined as a whole, it is seen that they are not consistent with the other evidence in the file that will be described in detail below; that especially the children’s statements, as indicated by the experts present during their taking in the FIR, were coached statements; that the statements of the witness Hediye were created to conceal the facts involved in Narin’s killing; that particularly the witness Hediye’s statements that she was at home on the day of the incident do not overlap with the other evidence; that, as will be explained below, the act of killing the deceased Narin was completed at home and subsequently the defendants reached a consensus regarding what would be done after the incident; and for this reason, our court accepted that the witness Hediye was made to give statements in this manner to conceal the incidents, and our court did not give credence to the statements of witness Hediye and the other child witnesses because they do not accord with the evidence in the file.\nIt was also observed that records were drawn up by the law enforcement officers conducting the investigation within the file. The relevant records were examined one by one by our court, and it was seen that, apart from the records described below that affect the intentional killing of Narin, there was no concrete data. Therefore, the signatories of the relevant records were not heard by our court, and the said records were not regarded as evidence affecting the merits in the concrete case when making the assessment. However, it was observed that in all the records kept in respect of the defendant Yüksel and in the interviews the defendant Yüksel gave to TV channels during the investigation stage, she generally made statements about how she could protect her son Enes and what she could do to prevent harm from coming to her son, and that the records in the file also indicated that the defendant made statements in the manner stated above. It was also observed that the defendant Yüksel, before the lifeless body of the deceased Narin had yet been found, continuously said that her daughter was dead and at least should have a grave. When this matter was asked of the defendant Yüksel by our court, she stated that her daughter had gone missing, and that she made such statements because the people who called her on the phone said, “We are the mafia, we will harm the defendant Enes,” but in a file where nearly every incident was recorded by law enforcement during the investigation stage, it was observed that there was no record corroborating the defendant Yüksel’s statements. Therefore, our court accepted that the defendant Yüksel knew that her daughter was dead before the lifeless body of the deceased Narin was found, and that by continually saying “how can I protect the defendant Enes,” she did not disclose and tried to conceal the truths regarding Narin’s death. It was understood by our court from the records kept that on 09/08/2024 in front of the Diyarbakır CFM and previously in the village there were mutual actions and statements by women; the persons involved in the incident were heard as witnesses, but since the said actions and statements were not directly related to the killing of Narin and did not contain concrete information about who knew and who committed the killing, the said witness statements were not taken into consideration by our court.\n\nCrime Scene Examination, Autopsy Report, and CFM Reports; ​\nWithin the framework of the search activities, it was observed that at around 08:30 on 09/08/2024, during a sweep conducted by the Gendarmerie Underwater Search and Rescue officers within the Eğertutmaz creek located in the Tavşantepe Neighborhood, upon reaching the coordinates 37 SFB 06008-89639, a sack was seen in the part where the Eğertutmaz creek joins the soil, wedged under rocks and covered by three stones of 40–50 cm in diameter so as to conceal it; that the lifeless body of Narin GÜRAN was reached in the said sack; and that the lifeless body of Narin GÜRAN was transferred to the Diyarbakır CFM Group Directorate for the purpose of conducting the autopsy.\nIt was stated in the initial examination conducted by the Council of Forensic Medicine that there was an amputation at the left knee, and that a tibia-like bone fragment and small pieces were found next to the location where the body was discovered; that the exact cause of death and other matters would be determined by pathological, biological, and chemical examinations to be conducted.\nAlthough it was not possible to collect entomological data during the crime scene examination and it was unknown whether the insects obtained represented the total assemblage on the body, and the temperature data could not be recorded in the microhabitat where the body was found, it was stated that, considering together the analysis of the insect fauna on the body, the colonization of the insects, and the development of the immature forms, the age of the examined samples could be 17 days (plus or minus) ±24 hours with respect to the time of collection (09/08/2024), and that this was consistent with the time when the deceased went missing (08/21/2024).\nDuring the search for Narin, upon determination on 08/26/2024 that the defendant Enes Güran had bruising on the inner part of his right arm and under his right eye, he was transferred by air to the Istanbul CFM. In the report of the 2nd Specialization Board of the Istanbul CFM dated 08/28/2024;\n\n\nConsidering together the localization, traumatic effects, color, size, and depth of the soft tissue lesions described and determined under the right eye and on the right forearm, these lesions were consistent with a time interval of 3–6 days,\nIt was determined that in the photographs taken on the first day and in the examination conducted at our Board, there was a 4.5x1.9 cm mildly ellipsoid-shaped ecchymosis in the middle of the inner surface of the right forearm, a 2.5x1.8 cm mildly ellipsoid-shaped ecchymosis lateral to this ecchymosis, and in these ecchymoses there were places with mild red discolorations, and that these lesions were consistent with a human bite mark; that the localizations of the lesions did not include the integrity of the typical and clear jaw movements encompassing all teeth, that since they were caused only by the tips, as asked, these lesions could belong to a small child (under 18) as well as to an adult, and that no distinction could be made between them,\nAccording to the panoramic radiograph examined, only qualitative analysis could be performed; for quantitative analysis the dental cast itself was necessary; however, it was stated that, qualitatively, occurrence with the existing teeth in the panoramic radiograph could not be ruled out,\nIn addition, in the interscapular region on the back, there were red discolorations, the largest being 1x0.1 cm and the smallest 0.1 cm in diameter,\n\n\nit was observed that a report was drawn up in this manner.\nIt was observed that in the interviews conducted by CFM experts with the defendant Enes Güran for the preparation of the report, he stated that on the day his sister Narin went missing, he was very distressed, that he caused the ecchymotic-looking lesion under his right eye himself, that is, by punching his face six times out of distress, and that he also caused the bite mark on the anterior middle part of his right arm himself, that is, by biting himself.\nThese injuries were asked in particular of the defendant Enes both during the investigation stage and during the trial conducted by our court; in his response, it was seen that he stated that he caused the bite on his arm by biting his arm in anger because he could not find his missing sister Narin and saw his family saddened, and that the bruises on his face occurred as a result of the leaves and ears of corn striking him while searching for the missing deceased Narin in the cornfield.\nIn our court’s evaluation of the injuries sustained by the defendant Enes, it was accepted that the defendant’s contradictory statements at various stages, when considered as a whole, were not compatible with the ordinary course of life.\nIt was further observed during the prosecution stage that a report regarding the macroscopic and microscopic examination of the hair samples found on Narin’s hand and clothing was sent to our court by the CFM. In the said report, it was determined that the mtDNA sequences of Yüksel Güran, Enes Güran, and Narin Güran were THE SAME according to the data obtained by sequencing the bases in the Control Region, which shows a high degree of polymorphism in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), for the approximately 29 cm brown hair samples found in the left palm of Narin GÜRAN and on the black shorts, and the approximately 16 cm and 11 cm brown hair samples taken from the undershirt.\nIt was observed that it was stated that mtDNA is transmitted only from the mother to the child and that individuals in the same maternal lineage (such as siblings, maternal grandmother, aunt, maternal uncle, aunt’s children) have the same base sequence; thus it provides information as to whether individuals come from the same maternal lineage.\nIt was observed that a search and examination were conducted on the vehicle with license plate 47 XX 388, which was in the actual use of Salim GÜRAN on the day of the incident and beforehand, and in the report drawn up as a result of the examination conducted by the Van Gendarmerie Criminal Laboratory on the samples obtained, it was stated that a DNA profile belonging to Narin GÜRAN was found on the seating part of the driver’s seat of the said vehicle.\nUpon the findings in the vehicle with license plate 47 XX 388 in the use of Salim GÜRAN, in order to conduct a more detailed examination within the vehicle, the said vehicle was sent by tow truck to the Van Gendarmerie Criminal Laboratory, and it was stated that in the detailed examination conducted, the hair sample obtained from the inner part of the right rear door of the vehicle belonged to Narin GÜRAN.\nWithin the scope of the file, in order to obtain evidence, examinations were conducted on carpets, kilims, quilts, pillows, clothing, the personal belongings of the Güran family, and other items such as stones and sand found at and around the scene; as a result of the examinations, multiple CFM reports were obtained, and it was stated in the reports that no findings constituting elements of the offense were encountered. Therefore, the said reports are not addressed one by one here; it was understood that the other reports, apart from those stated and discussed in the reasoned judgment, did not provide concrete data regarding the killing of the deceased Narin Güran.\n\n\nAs for other evidence; ​\nIn the records kept by law enforcement officers, it was seen that the defendant Salim, who is the village headman, made constant contradictory and suspicious statements during the search activities, that he directed the law enforcement officers to places other than the scene, causing the lifeless body of the deceased Narin to be found late, and that especially on the day of the disappearance, he gave different and contradictory time information in the information he provided to law enforcement officers and other talks he had, and that in his phone calls (it was determined that these calls were identified because the defendant Salim had installed a recording program on his own phone) he constantly mentioned different times.\nIt was observed that the defendant Salim Güran had installed a program on his personal phone that records calls. The conversations in the relevant program were transcribed into Turkish and placed in the file. Upon examination, no conversation relating to the killing of the deceased Narin was encountered. It was also seen that the defendant told the people who called him that he was engaged in search activities, that they were looking everywhere, that gypsies might have kidnapped Narin in a red car, and that he told the villagers to search in corn or other fields. However, it was understood that there were no recordings of the calls made on the night of the incident, 08/21/2024, and thereafter, that the relevant program was deactivated by the user at around 00:31 on 08/22/2024. Furthermore, when the defendant’s Historical Traffic (HTS) records and the call recordings on the phone were compared, it was seen that there were recordings of some calls made on the day of the incident, that recordings of some calls were deleted, and likewise that some messaging records, especially WhatsApp conversations and messages, were also deleted. When this matter was asked of the defendant by our court, he stated that he was the headman and therefore was constantly called, that he forgot some things, that he had the call-recording program installed by someone else so as not to forget, but that he did not intentionally delete it on the day of the incident and thereafter, and moreover that he deleted his WhatsApp history because he communicated with an escort. However, upon examination, it was understood that the conversations with the escort and some unimportant messages as well as some call recordings remained. Our court evaluated this as an extraordinary situation. Because it would be expected that the defendant Salim, who is the village headman, would be frequently called on the day of the disappearance and thereafter, that a forgetful person whose genuine intention is to find the missing girl would use this call-recording program more during the search for the disappearance, that the village headman would be constantly called by others and given information, that a forgetful person could later listen again to these calls and tell the law enforcement units the matters he deemed important, and perhaps have the relevant calls listened to by law enforcement. While these circumstances were present, the defendant’s deletion of the said program long in use after midnight on the day of the disappearance case, as well as his deletion of some of the call recordings he made during the day while not deleting others and similarly deleting the WhatsApp history yet keeping the escort messages he did not want to come to light and some unimportant messages, was accepted by our court as indicating that the defendant concealed something, acted in this way to hide something, did not want the lifeless body of the deceased Narin to be found, and concealed the truths regarding Narin’s death and prevented their emergence.\nIt was also seen that members of the Güran family deleted their phone histories at this stage. Although this is not direct evidence affecting the concrete case, it was considered a suspicious and noteworthy behavior.\nWithin the scope of the investigations conducted, it was observed that the camera recordings in and around the village were examined, that the clearest last image of the deceased Narin GÜRAN belonged to the camera of the Tavşantepe Primary School, and since it was understood that the deceased Narin GÜRAN at 15:15:14 on 08/21/2024 left the camera angle and headed for the footpath leading to her residence, in detailed examinations it was understood that at 15:41:56 on 08/21/2024, the red-colored vehicle with license plate 23 XX 630 entered the angle of the camera belonging to the farm located on the opposite side of the Tavşantepe neighborhood, that the vehicle then stopped at 15:44:43 on the dirt road near the Eğertutmaz creek, and that it left the vicinity of the Eğertutmaz creek 38 minutes and 11 seconds later according to the camera time. Following the examination, upon understanding that the said vehicle was driven by the defendant Nevzat Bahtiyar, the defendant Nevzat Bahtiyar was apprehended and taken into custody. It was seen that when the defendant was taken into custody, he told the law enforcement officers that the deceased was killed by Salim, that the lifeless body of Narin was given to him, and that he hid it in the creek.\nDuring the investigation stage conducted by the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, expert police specialized in the crime scene and appraisers serving in different provinces were brought to Diyarbakır and investigations were conducted at and around the location where the deceased was last seen. In the narrowed Cell Tower Report prepared as a result of the investigations conducted;\nWhen the HTS records of the phone number 0530XXX0653 (Turkcell) used by the defendant Salim GÜRAN were examined; it was observed that at around 14:52 on 08/21/2024 he left his own residence, that he was between his own residence and the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that at around 14:55 he was on and around the road between his own residence and the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that he was in the vicinity of the residence of Arif GÜRAN until 15:18, that he was on the road and in the garden area between his own residence and the residence of Arif GÜRAN until 15:19, that he then headed toward the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that at around 15:20 he came to the residence of Arif GÜRAN and then came to the stable part at the back of the house, that at around 15:22 he was inside the house, that between 15:22 and 15:26 he was in the place referred to as the empty room opposite the kitchen in the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that until around 15:32 he continued to be inside the residence of Arif GÜRAN and moved inside the other rooms, that at around 15:36 he passed to the back of the stable, then re-entered the residence of Arif GÜRAN and stayed in the residence, that at around 15:41 he again passed to the back of the stable, that at 15:42 he was on the road between his residence and the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that at around 15:43 he was in front of the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that at around 15:52 while he was at the residence of Arif GÜRAN he called the phone number 0531XXX1521 registered to Mehmet Selim Atasoy and had a call lasting 31 seconds, that at 16:08 he was at the back of the stable of the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that at around 16:10 he left the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that at around 16:10 he left the residence of Arif GÜRAN and moved toward the cornfield located above the village, that it was stated that the phone used by Salim GÜRAN at around 22:47 on 08/21/2024 came to the place where the body of Narin GÜRAN was found (this matter was corrected in the supplementary report) and left at 22:55 on the same day.\nWhen the HTS records of the phone number 0539XXX7358 (Turkcell) used by the defendant Enes GÜRAN were examined, it was observed that at around 14:30 on 08/21/2024 he was at his residence, that he continued to receive GPRS until 15:41, that at 15:41 he gave a cell from his residence and remained in the residence and its outbuildings until 15:51, that at 15:57 he moved to the residence of Salim GÜRAN and remained there and between then and 16:04 was in an area whose exact location could not be determined, that at around 16:11 he headed toward his own residence, that thereafter until 17:50 he was in his residence and its outbuildings and moved intermittently, that after 17:50 he was outside the residence and moved around the vicinity of the residence, and that at around 18:13 on the same day he turned off his phone or it turned off in a location close to the school, and that the phone was turned on at 04:44 on 08/22/2024.\nWhen the HTS records of the phone number 0536XXX7120 (Turkcell) used by the defendant Yüksel GÜRAN were examined, it was observed that between 14:28–15:38 on 08/21/2024 she was in her residence and its outbuildings, that between 15:39 and 16:39 she was again in her residence and its outbuildings, and that after 16:39 on the same day she continued to remain and move in her residence and its outbuildings.\nWhen the HTS records of the phone number 0533XXX9779 (Turkcell) used by the defendant Nevzat BAHTİYAR were examined, it was observed that at around 15:08 on 08/21/2024 he called the defendant Salim GÜRAN and spoke for 42 seconds and then left his residence, that at around 15:10 he was on the paved road between the residences of Arif GÜRAN and Salim GÜRAN and near the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that at 15:18 he was very close to the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that at around 15:26 he came in front of the residence of Arif GÜRAN, that at 15:27 he was inside the house and its outbuildings and remained at the house until 15:35 on the same day, that thereafter at around 15:40 he was near the school, that at 15:57 he was in the field area, that at around 16:00 he was in the area where the body of Narin GÜRAN was located, and that at around 16:35 he left the place where the body of Narin GÜRAN was found and returned toward Tavşantepe village.\nThe defense counsel of the defendants objected to the said report. Upon the objection, our court obtained a supplementary report from the experts. In the supplementary report obtained;\n\n\nOn 08/29/2024–08/30/2024 and on 09/08/2024–09/09/2024, the dates when Narin GÜRAN’s body was found, narrowed cell-tower studies were conducted in Tavşantepe village; on all suspects, the residence of Salim GÜRAN, the residences of Arif GÜRAN and Nevzat BAHTİYAR, the intermediate locations, and the streets, during different days and times, day and night, and especially while working around the residence of Arif GÜRAN and Salim GÜRAN, to avoid congestion in the cell, the phones of personnel in the area were turned off; taking such matters into consideration, using different programs, with at least two lines each from Turkcell, Vodafone, and Türk Telekom, step-by-step work was conducted at the residences and outbuildings of Arif GÜRAN, Salim GÜRAN, and Nevzat BAHTİYAR and on the intermediate roads, and after hundreds of operations were performed meticulously and accurately without error regarding the main cell, side cells, and GPRS cells serving the area, determinations were made,\nBecause Tavşantepe village is located on a hill, it receives signals from many cells in the city center and surrounding areas, and due to the number of cells being quite high, this facilitated the possibility of conducting narrowed-area cell studies at the locations indicated; otherwise, if the number of cells were low, these studies could not have been detailed to such an extent; furthermore, because the area where Narin GÜRAN’s body was found is below the village, the cells could serve a somewhat wider area, and due to the areas being wide in places such as where the body was found and the cornfield, the cell study could not be conducted in very great detail,\nAs can be seen, the Tavşantepe village does not receive signal from only one cell, but from at least 20 different cells, whose names are:\n\n\nDiyarbakır Bağlar Yeniköy Bediuzzaman Cd,\n\n\nDiyarbakır Sur Yeşilvadi 1045.

Our panel especially examined the defendant’s demeanor and conduct in the videos of the statements he gave during the investigation stage and while giving statements before our court. As a result of this examination, it was observed that the defendant had difficulties in expressing himself, that he could not complete sentences when forming them, that he narrated the events not in chronological order but in a confused manner, and that when narrating an event he did not recount it in full but briefly; therefore, both during the investigation and prosecution stages, his statements could only be obtained by constantly asking him questions, and likewise when his defense against the opinion was taken by our court, when he was asked to make a defense without any questions being asked, he could not fully express himself and conveyed sentences incompletely and incorrectly; considering also that the defendant and his defense prepared for the final defense, it was observed that the defendant had difficulties in expressing himself, and thus our court understood that the defendant expressed himself by giving short, brief answers to the questions asked. For this reason, our court evaluated the defendant’s statements as a whole and gave credence to his statements before our court that were consistent with the evidence in the file. Furthermore, what should be noted here is that in all his statements at various stages, consistently, the defendant stated that the deceased Narin was killed by the defendant Salim and that her lifeless body was handed over to him.\nIn the defendant Nevzat’s statements, which our court credited, he stated in summary that;\n\nAt around 15:08 he called the defendant Salim due to a matter regarding water,\nAfter a while, the defendant Salim called him down from the top of the place where Arif’s residence is located,\nThereafter, together with the defendant Salim they entered Arif’s house,\nMeanwhile, when he entered the house, all the doors of the rooms except one were closed,\nHe did not see anyone else in the house other than the defendant Salim,\nThe defendant Salim took him to a room inside the house and showed him the lifeless body of Narin lying on the floor,\nAt that moment, he saw fluids flowing from the mouth of the deceased Narin due to death,\nThe defendant Salim told him that he was together with the defendant Yüksel,\nThat because he saw this, he killed the deceased Narin,\nFurthermore, that he threatened him with a gun and told him to dispose of Narin’s body, otherwise he would kill his son and harm his family,\nUpon this, that he wrapped the lifeless body of Narin in a blanket and left the house,\nThat he took the lifeless body of Narin to his own stable and placed it in a sack,\nThat during this time he met the defendant Salim again,\nThat upon the defendant Salim saying “take it to the lake and dismember,” he put the sack containing the lifeless body of Narin into his car, left there, and took it to the Eğertutmaz creek\n\nit was observed that he so stated.\nIn his defense at various stages, the defendant Salim stated in summary that he did not accept the charges against him, that he was at home on the day of the incident, that he then went to the field, that he learned by phone that the deceased Narin had gone missing, and that he did not accept the statements of the defendant Nevzat.\nIn her statements at various stages, the defendant Yüksel stated that,\n\nShe denied the charges against her,\nOn the day of the incident, the witness Hediye came to the house, and that they folded laundry together while chatting,\nShe learned that her daughter, the deceased Narin, had gone missing in the evening when she did not come home,\n\nIn her defense before our court, the defendant Yüksel stated that,\n\nShe persistently emphasized her chastity,\nThat the statement in the defendant Nevzat’s declaration that the defendant Salim said, “I killed her because I saw my relationship with Yüksel,” was a slander,\n\nOur court formed the opinion that the defendant Yüksel did not have a relationship with the defendant Salim during the incident, and as will be explained below, it was accepted that because the defendants Salim, Yüksel, and Enes jointly killed the deceased Narin for a reason that our court could not understand, in order to conceal the real motive, the defendant Salim made a statement of this sort to the defendant Nevzat, and that this statement was made to conceal the real motive that led to Narin’s killing.\nIn his defense at various stages, the defendant Enes stated that he denied the charges against him, that he came from the province of Malatya in the morning of the day of the incident, that he slept at noon-afternoon because he was tired, and that he met with his friends in the evening.\n\n\nAnalysis report of the Diyarbakır Provincial Gendarmerie Command ​\nIn the analysis report prepared by the Diyarbakır Provincial Gendarmerie Command; it was observed that the HTS records and cell data of the phone number 0530XXX0653 used by the defendant Salim Güran, the phone number 0533XXX9779 used by the defendant Nevzat Bahtiyar, the phone number 0536XXX7120 used by the defendant Yüksel Güran, and the phone number 0539XXX7358 used by the defendant Enes Güran were examined and compared. In the said report;\n\nIt was observed that in the time period after 15:15, which is the time when the deceased Narin Güran was killed, the relevant phone numbers were in the village and at different angles from the same cell towers; it was seen that at around 15:16 the defendants used the cell tower 665638530027 opr: Turkcell DIYKA27L Diyarbakır Bağlar Bağcılar 1074 street 52 (Diykaranfil street). In the evaluations made here, it was seen that the defendants acted together and were aware of each other in the time period when the deceased Narin was killed.\nIt was seen that the situation of jointly using the same cell by the defendant Nevzat and the defendant Salim increased between 15:25 and 15:46; it was observed that the defendants predominantly used the cell towers named 665754107021 opr: Turkcell DBYMZ21L Diyarbakır Bağlar Yeniköy Bediüzzaman Street DİYYENIKOYMEZAR Bağlar Diyarbakır, 66638854032 opr: Turkcell DSALI32L Diyarbakır Sur Ali Paşa Karabulut 1.

Again, the defendant Enes’s conversation at around 15:45 with the person named Kerem Sümer clearly shows the cell data.\n\n\n\nVideo recordings ​\nIn the examination of the video recordings in the file; it was seen that during the prosecution stage, a UKB expert report was requested to enhance the DARAN-2 footage, and the report sent stated that at 15:18:47 (the said time is 6 minutes ahead of the current time) there was a dark figure in the stable next to the residence of Arif Güran, and that at 15:19:05 there was an intense light flare reflected from beside the stable into the camera and there was mention of vehicle movement. It was seen that both the complainant party and the defendants’ counsel agreed that the said vehicle was later determined to be other vehicles reflected in the farm camera.\nAgain, under the other data arranged under the heading of Movement detected at the scene; it was observed that at 15:23:06 there were 2 dark figures in front of the stable, and at 15:25:53 there was a dark figure in the place referred to as the back of the stable.\nConsidering the distance of the relevant DARAN-2 camera to the house of Arif Güran and its annexes, known as the scene, and the video quality, it was seen that it was stated that the video could only be enhanced to this extent.\nIt was also seen that there were farm camera recordings belonging to Mehmet Sait Tek in the file. An examination record of the relevant footage was included in the file. Upon examination, it was seen that at 15:41:56 (the camera time and date are current) a suspicious vehicle was traveling from the Tavşantepe neighborhood toward the Özdemir neighborhood Gönenli clustered houses (Eğertutmaz creek) direction, that thereafter at 16:22:04 the vehicle left the Eğertutmaz creek (the said vehicle remained at the Eğertutmaz creek for approximately 38 minutes and 11 seconds), and thereafter at 16:23:54 the vehicle passed in front of the camera located in the Özdemir neighborhood Gönenli clustered houses; it was understood in the examination that the vehicle was a red Şahin-brand vehicle, and after this work the defendant Nevzat Bahtiyar was apprehended. It was also seen that at around 22:35 another vehicle that could not be identified went to the Eğertutmaz creek.\nIt was also seen that there were camera recordings belonging to a person named Ruhi Kaya in the file. It was observed that the parties to the case, namely the complainant party and the defendants’ counsel, agreed on the relevant footage, and that the parties concurred that the white vehicle passing there belonged to the defendant Salim. In our court’s examination, it was seen that at 16:15:29 a white vehicle was traveling in the upper right corner of the camera, and at 18:35 the same vehicle again passed in front of the camera.\nIn the examination conducted in light of all this evidence; our court accepted that the narrowed cell data, the statements of the defendant Nevzat credited by our court, the Technical Analysis report of the Diyarbakır Provincial Gendarmerie Command, the CFM reports, the camera footage, the report prepared by the UKB, and the other evidence mentioned above are consistent with each other, and that, in terms of the main subject, they support and corroborate each other.\nOther evidence submitted to the file by the complainant, the complainant’s counsel, the complainant institutions, the defendants, and the defense counsel did not contribute to the concrete case; therefore, our court did not give credence to them and they are not addressed here."

    "text": "Assessment of Participation ​\nIn our court’s assessments on participation;\nIn its decision numbered 2013/91, the Penal General Assembly of the Court of Cassation stated that Article 37 of the Turkish Penal Code (TPC) No. 5237, under the heading of Perpetration, is regulated as follows: “Each of those who jointly commit the act included in the legal definition of the offense shall be liable as a perpetrator.” If the act defined as an offense in the law is committed in concert by more than one accomplice, joint perpetration as regulated in Article 37/1 of the TPC will be at issue. Taking into account the views in the doctrine as well, two conditions must be met together for joint perpetration: 1- There must be a joint decision among the perpetrators to commit the offense. 2- There must be joint control over the commission of the offense. In joint perpetration, since there is joint control over the act in addition to a joint decision to commit the offense, each accomplice is in the position of a “perpetrator.” In determining whether joint control over the act has been established, the roles undertaken by the accomplices in the commission of the offense and the significance of their contributions should be considered. Joint perpetration will also be at issue where the accomplices’ contributions to the commission of the offense complete each other’s acts. Accordingly, it has been stated that each joint perpetrator makes an effective, functional contribution to the execution of the offense.\nIn its decision docket No. 2017/1-279, decision No. 2019/30, the Penal General Assembly of the Court of Cassation explained as follows: “In the first paragraph of Article 37 of the TPC No. 5237, joint perpetration is regulated by the provision: ‘(1) Each of those who jointly commit the act included in the legal definition of the offense shall be liable as a perpetrator.’ If the act defined as an offense in the law is committed in concert by more than one accomplice, joint perpetration as regulated in the first paragraph of Article 37 of the TPC will be at issue. Taking into account the views in the doctrine as well, two conditions must be met together for joint perpetration: 1- There must be a joint decision among the perpetrators to commit the offense. 2- There must be joint control over the commission of the offense. In joint perpetration, since there is joint control over the act in addition to a joint decision to commit the offense, each accomplice is in the position of a ‘perpetrator.’ In determining whether joint control over the act has been established, the roles undertaken by the accomplices in the commission of the offense and the significance of their contributions should be considered. To determine whether a person’s conduct has reached the stage of participation in an offense, and if so, to determine the level of participation, all the evidence must be evaluated together, taking into account not the situation at one stage of the act, but the decision made to commit the act, the manner in which that decision was executed, and the behaviors before, during, and after the incident. For one of the most important elements sought in joint perpetration is the person’s joint control over the act during the commission of the offense.”\nIn its decision docket No. 2017/937, decision No. 2017/484, the Penal General Assembly of the Court of Cassation ruled as follows: “According to the provisions on participation in the Law No. 5237, their reasoning, and the practices of the Court of Cassation, the forms and level of participation are determined by the measure of control established over the commission of the act. The forms of participation envisaged in the system of the Penal Code as statuses of liability are regulated as perpetration, instigation, and aiding. With the expression in Article 37(1) of the TPC, ‘each of those who jointly commit the act included in the legal definition of the offense shall be liable as a perpetrator,’ the scope of the concept of perpetration has been kept quite broad, and anyone who establishes control over the conduct enabling the commission of the offense is deemed a perpetrator. Establishing control over the conduct may occur in the form of jointly carrying it out, and also encompasses jointly performing the conduct based on an implicit or explicit division of labor. Accordingly, even those who do not perform the act that results in the offense but prepare the necessary environment for another’s performance of that act are deemed perpetrators; therefore, many of the acts directed at the victim during the commission of the offense must be assessed as perpetration pursuant to Article 37 of the TPC. To determine whether a person’s conduct has reached the stage of participation in an offense, and if so to determine the level of participation, it is necessary to evaluate all the evidence together, taking into account not the situation at one phase of the conduct, but the decision made to commit the conduct, the manner in which that decision was executed, and the behaviors before, during, and after the incident. For the intent to commit an offense (mens rea) may form at every stage until the offense is completed. The will to participate may form at any stage of the offense. In light of these explanations and the provisions of Article 37, for joint perpetration it is required that more than one person jointly decide to commit the offense, that to realize this decision the acts of execution of the offense—i.e., its material element—be jointly carried out, and that joint control be established over the execution of the act. Since the will to participate and intent are concepts related to a person’s inner world, where these are not expressly stated, this fact of the inner world must be determined by looking at behaviors reflected in the external world.”\nIn its decision docket No. 2015/1-1146, decision No. 2019/206, the Penal General Assembly of the Court of Cassation ruled as follows: “Although he saw the scene, from a point at a distance that prevented establishing joint control over the killing that took place inside the garden, the accused watched the incident from beginning to end; the act whereby the deceased was struck by Kerem Mutkan with a lug wrench and screwdriver he took from his own vehicle, and by Recep Kazak with a piece of wood, and then stabbed to death by the accused Resul, was committed in concert by Resul, Recep, and Kerem, who, by jointly deciding and establishing control over the act, acted in participation in the commission of the offense defined as killing; the accused, on the other hand, neither engaged in any preventive conduct to show that he did not side with the acts of Resul, Ekrem, and Recep during the commission of the act, nor left the scene until the other accused completed their acts against the deceased, and by waiting at the scene, he emboldened and facilitated the commission of the acts by the accused outside the scope of this review; and after the incident, he took the principal perpetrators of the offense—Resul, Recep, and Kerem—into the vehicle under his control and left the scene. When these matters are assessed as a whole, it must be accepted that the accused’s act constitutes, not the offense of harboring a criminal—an offense against the administration of justice that can be committed solely to save a person who committed a crime from investigation, arrest, detention, or execution of the sentence without participating in the offense in any way—but the offense of intentional killing by facilitating the execution of the offense by aiding during the commission of the intentional killing of the deceased Erkan Tünkler.”\nIn its decision dated 03/19/2013 and numbered 1-81/91, the Penal General Assembly of the Court of Cassation ruled as follows: “When the facts that the accused D, upon seeing that his friend M had been injured by the deceased, instead of separating D and the deceased together with the bar staff witnesses present at the scene and immediately taking his friend, who had a stab wound in his leg, to the hospital, attacked the deceased with the knife he had on him; that he remained with the accused M until the end of the incident; that he did not utter any words or engage in any conduct to prevent the act of intentional killing carried out by the accused M—are assessed together, it must be accepted that the accused D participated in the intentional killing committed by the accused M.”\nIn its judgment docket No. 2020/2086, decision No. 2021/934, the 1st Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation ruled as follows: “It was established that the deceased child Kenan, aged 5, lived together with his mother Döndü and his mother’s boyfriend İbrahim Halil; that according to the Forensic Medicine report, on the date of the incident he died as a result of traumatic intracranial changes together with fractures of the skull and facial bones due to the impact of a blunt object; that there were previously healed bone fractures on his body; that it was understood he had previously been battered by the accused or the accused; that on the day the deceased died, after he fainted, the accused did not call 112; that upon understanding the deceased had died, the accused, acting with unity of idea and action, took the deceased and buried him in land belonging to the father of the accused İbrahim Halil Kılınç; thereafter, when the family members asked about the deceased, they stated that they had placed the deceased in a state institution; and finally, the accused Döndü went to the police and filed a missing person report regarding her minor son. When these matters are assessed together, since it is understood that the accused Döndü acted in solidarity with unity of idea and will and established joint control over the result, committing the offense together with the other accused İbrahim Halil, she must be punished as a joint perpetrator within the scope of Articles 37 and 82/1-d-e of the TPC regarding the offense against the deceased.”\nIn its judgment docket No. 2023/6009, decision No. 2024/5580, the 1st Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation ruled as follows: “…although the accused did not accept the charges, given that the victim’s allegation regarding the accused is corroborated by witness statements, it is understood from the accused’s conduct during and after the incident that they participated in the offense of attempted intentional killing within the scope of Article 37 of Law No. 5237 by acting with unity of idea and will and establishing joint control over the act.”\nIn its judgment docket No. 2023/7593, decision No. 2024/3717, the 1st Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation ruled as follows: “Considering that after the accused left the scene, according to witness accounts, it was understood that the deceased was still alive; that after leaving the scene, the accused Mustafa went to the house of the accused Süleyman, sat there for a while without telling the household anything, then went to his own home and was apprehended there by law enforcement; that during this period, as can also be understood from witness accounts, he made no effort to prevent the death of the deceased, who was understood to be alive, and did not notify the police or medical teams; it is concluded that the accused acted with unity of idea and will, established joint control over the act, and thus carried out the act; therefore, the accused Mustafa is also a joint perpetrator.”\nIn the assessment of participation in light of the Court of Cassation decisions mentioned above; Article 37, regulated under the heading of Perpetration in the section on Participation in Offenses in our Turkish Penal Code, provides that: “Each of those who jointly commit the act included in the legal definition of the offense shall be liable as a perpetrator.” Anyone who establishes control over the conduct enabling the commission of the offense is deemed a perpetrator. Establishing control over the conduct may occur in the form of jointly carrying it out, and also encompasses jointly performing the conduct based on an implicit or explicit division of labor. The will to participate in question may be realized pursuant to a decision taken beforehand, or it may be realized by agreeing over the act during a spontaneously developing incident. What must be noted here is that the act must not yet be fully completed, that is, the offense must not be consummated. Acts occurring after the completion of the offense are not accepted as participation but will give rise to other offenses (as will be explained below with respect to the accused Nevzat, hiding or destroying evidence of the offense). The matter of participation is generally regulated in our law, and what constitutes participation has been shaped by the decisions of the Court of Cassation. However, since each concrete case contains different characteristics in itself, it is necessary to assess the matter of the accused’s participation separately in each concrete case. Therefore, the participation of the accused in the act that occurred may take different forms, and in each case the acts carried out by the accused must be described separately. However, as noted above, sometimes it is not possible to ascertain what the acts of the accused were in the act that occurred. In such situations, it will suffice to determine whether the accused acted in participation in the act in question; the inability to determine what the accused’s acts were will not create a doubt in favor of the accused in the concrete case. How will it be determined whether the accused participated in an act? Since the will to participate and intent are concepts related to a person’s inner world, where these cannot be clearly determined, this fact of the inner world can be determined by looking at behaviors reflected in the external world. Whether the accused who were together during the incident participated in the offense can be understood from their behaviors after the incident. In cases where an accused does not engage in any preventive conduct to show that he does not side with the act that took place beside him; where the person committing the offense draws strength from other persons present during the commission of the offense; where what is to be done after the completed act is jointly determined; where, by supporting the person committing the offense during and after the offense, efforts are made to conceal, hide, or prevent the discovery of the evidence of the offense; where, despite the duty to prevent any harm that may befall the deceased, the necessary intervention is not made to the person committing the act by acting contrary to this duty; where, foremost by notifying 112, no concrete conduct is engaged in to show the absence of participation in the act—under such circumstances, it will be accepted that the accused acted in participation.\nIn their defenses at various stages and in their statements before our court, the accused persistently stated that they did not see, did not hear, and did not remember. By making statements in this manner, the accused sought to escape liability by failing to provide reasonable answers to the questions of how, why, for what reason, and by whom the act of killing the deceased Narin was carried out. The TPC and the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) grant the accused, as a legal right, the ability to engage in conduct aimed at escaping liability, including primarily telling falsehoods. However, in prosecutions where the accused, acting in solidarity with unity of idea and will and establishing joint control over the result, participate in the act, by preventing determinations as to how, why, and for what reason the act was carried out, what the accused’s acts were, and whether there were other accused who participated in this act, it is obvious that their expectation of acquittal is neither legally nor conscientiously acceptable. Therefore, as stated above, the inability to determine the ancillary questions will not create a favorable situation for the accused, and it must be accepted that the accused will be liable as participants in the act that occurred."

    "text": "Assessment Regarding the Defendants ​\nIn the assessment made in light of all this information;\nIn the UKB report obtained for the enhancement of the DARAN-2 camera recordings contained in the file,\n\nThat there was a moving dark figure in the direction of the house–barn,\nThat, since this figure appeared to be of dark-colored clothing and short, thin build, and in view of its consistency with the school camera recording located at the beginning of the path where Narin was last seen, the relevant figure was the deceased,\n\nhas been accepted by our Court.\nIn view of this situation,\n\nThat the act of killing the deceased Narin was initiated in the house, the barn, or its extensions,\nSubsequently, that the deceased Narin’s body was brought to the house of the Complainant Arif Güran and the killing act was completed there,\nThat thereafter the deceased Narin’s lifeless body was taken by the defendant Nevzat from the house of the Complainant Arif, first placed in a sack in the barn of his own house,\nThat the said sack was placed into the vehicle with license plate 23 XX 630 used by the defendant Nevzat, taken to the Eğertutmaz creek, and left by the creek bank with stones placed on it,\n\nhas been deemed established by our Court.\nDuring the time period in which the deceased Narin was killed, the defendants Enes GÜRAN, Salim GÜRAN, and Yüksel GÜRAN\n\nWere present in the house, the barn, or its extensions,\nThat this matter is established by the UKB, the narrowed cell-site data, the camera recordings, the analysis report, and all other evidence,\nThat by a defendant or defendants not clearly identified by our Court, the act of killing the deceased Narin was initiated in the house, the barn, or its extensions,\nThat thereafter the deceased Narin’s body was carried into the house,\nThat at this point, the completion of the killing act by the defendants Enes, Yüksel, and Salim was awaited,\nThat although each of the three defendants had the possibility to save the deceased Narin from death by a medical intervention to be performed in the house, the barn, or its extensions, this intervention was not performed and they consented to Narin’s death,\nMoreover, that the defendants in the file are Yüksel as the mother of the deceased, Salim as her uncle, and Enes as her brother,\nThat although the defendants had the legal duties to ward off, prevent, or avert attacks, harm, or other negative acts that might befall the deceased, they failed to fulfill these duties and, by not preventing the person who initiated the killing act, participated in the death of the deceased Narin,\nThat again, after the deceased Narin’s body was brought into the house and after the occurrence of the death, the defendants acted in unity of idea and action regarding what acts, behaviors, and statements they would carry out concerning the death event, and decided what to do,\nThat thereafter, by giving the said lifeless body to the defendant Nevzat, who was near the scene, and requesting that he bury it in the creek, they acted jointly to conceal or destroy the body,\nThat thereafter they behaved as if they had no knowledge regarding the death event,\nThat again, when the deceased Narin’s lifeless body was given to the defendant Nevzat, only Salim was inside the house and the other doors were closed, and in view of this, the defendants Yüksel and Enes who were in the house waited behind closed doors in agreement with the defendant Salim,\nThat the statements by the defendant Salim to the defendant Nevzat, to the effect that he killed the deceased Narin because he had seen his relationship with Yüksel, were also decided jointly by the other defendants in order to conceal the true motive of the killing act,\nThat the defendant Nevzat stated he saw the defendant Yüksel crying as he took the deceased Narin’s lifeless body and left the scene,\nTherefore, that while the deceased Narin’s lifeless body was being handed over by the defendant Salim to the defendant Nevzat, the other defendants were aware of the incident,\nThat each of the three defendants, through the roles they undertook in the commission of the offense and through their own acts completing the acts of the other defendants, established joint control over the commission of the offense together with the other defendants,\nIn this context, that the defendants maintained unity of time and place until the end of the incident and, acting in participation, the defendants Salim Güran, Enes Güran, and Yüksel Güran, in unity of idea and action, caused the death of the deceased Narin Güran in participation,\n\nhas been accepted by our Court.\nIn view of all these statements, it has been understood that the killing of the deceased Narin was completed by the three defendants together.\n\nSalim Güran ​\nIn the assessment made by our Court regarding the defendant Salim; as detailed above, together with the other defendants Yüksel and Enes, the defendant Salim\n\nParticipated in the act of killing the deceased Narin and killed her,\nThereafter, together with the other defendants, decided what they would do after the killing act,\nThat at this time he was near the scene and spoke on the phone at around 15:08,\nGave the deceased Narin’s lifeless body to the defendant Nevzat and requested that he dispose of it,\nThat this matter was decided together with the other defendants while they were by the lifeless body of the deceased Narin in the house of Arif Güran,\nThereafter, that the defendants continued their routine daily lives in an effort not to attract attention,\nHowever, that the defendant did not make a clear statement regarding the DNA found in his vehicle during the stages,\nCould not explain the suspicious actions he performed on his phone,\nMade contradictory statements regarding the time and manner of Narin’s disappearance,\nAnd that, although the defendant was at the house of the Complainant Arif at the time of the incident and afterwards, he attempted to escape liability by saying and causing to be said that he was in the field, contrary to the witness statements; therefore, that the defendant Salim, together with the other defendants Enes and Yüksel, killed the deceased Narin,\n\nhas been deemed established by our Court.\n\n\nEnes Güran ​\nIn the assessment made by our Court regarding the defendant Enes;\nIn his defense at various stages, the defendant Enes\n\nStated that he was sleeping at home; however, according to the narrowed cell-site data contained in the file and credited by our Court as it is consistent with the other evidence,\n\nHe remained inside the residence and its outbuildings until 15:51,\nAt 15:57 he moved to the house of Salim GÜRAN,\nStayed in the house for a while,\nAround 16:11 he headed towards his own house,\n\nin view of these matters, since it is understood that during the time period when the deceased Narin left the path and headed towards the barn the defendant was awake and in motion, our Court did not credit the defendant’s statements,\nConsidering the defendant Nevzat’s statement that “When I came to the house, all the doors were closed,” the defendant was inside the house during the time period indicated and, in unity of idea with the other defendants, remained quiet in the house, waiting for Nevzat to take the deceased Narin’s lifeless body,\nThat after the defendant Nevzat left the scene, he went to the house of his uncle, the defendant Salim, also shows that he was aware of the acts that took place,\nThat the defendant, upon being taken into custody, made contradictory statements at various stages regarding the bruises and bite marks on his body, and that, in view of this, the defendant attempted to conceal an existing truth,\nThat while the defendant was at home, when the defendant Nevzat came to the house and took the deceased Narin’s lifeless body, the defendant was also aware of the defendant Salim’s statement, “I had a relationship with her mother Yüksel, she saw it and that is why I killed her,” and consented to this statement,\nThat again, considering together the other statements of the defendant Yüksel reflected in the official records to the effect of how she could protect the defendant Enes, it is established that the defendant acted in participation together with the other defendants,\n\nhas been deemed established by our Court.\n\n\nYÜksel Güran ​\nIn the assessment made by our Court regarding the defendant Yüksel;\nIn her defense at various stages, the defendant Yüksel\n\nInsistently stated that she was at home at the time of the incident and saw nothing,\nAgain stated that it was not true that the deceased Narin’s lifeless body was taken from the house and that no one other than Hediye came to the house; however, according to the narrowed cell-site data contained in the file, this does not reflect the truth,\nBecause both the defendant Salim and the defendant Nevzat came to the house of Arif Güran,\nTherefore, the defendant, by not telling the truth, attempted to conceal the facts,\nIn view of the defendant Nevzat’s statement that he saw the defendant Yüksel as he took the deceased Narin’s lifeless body and left, and that she was crying, the defendant was aware of the deceased Narin’s death,\nThat during the stage where the first killing act was performed against the deceased Narin in the barn and thereafter the killing act was completed by bringing her into the house, the defendant did not engage in any concrete act showing that she did not participate in the said offense,\nThat, being the mother of the deceased, although the defendant had the duty to prevent harms or attacks that might befall her, she acted contrary to this duty,\nEven if, for a moment, credit were given to the defendant’s statements and it were accepted that she did not personally kill the deceased Narin, the fact that she failed to notify the relevant authorities did not prevent the occurrence of the death result, which in itself means participation in the killing act,\nThat again, acting in unity of idea and action together with the other defendants, the defendant consented to the defendant Salim making a statement to the defendant Nevzat concerning his own honor,\nTherefore, the defendant participated in the killing act of the deceased Narin together with the other defendants Salim and Enes,\nhas been deemed established by our Court.\n\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar ​\nIn the assessment made by our Court regarding the defendant Nevzat;\nAlthough a public action was brought before our Court against the defendant Nevzat Bahtiyar on the charge that he killed the deceased Narin together with the defendants Enes Güran, Salim Güran, and Yüksel Güran;\n\nIn the only unchanging defense of the defendant Nevzat at various stages, it is seen that he\n\nDid not kill the deceased Narin,\nThat the defendant Salim killed her and gave him the lifeless body,\n\nstated this.\nDuring the period when the deceased Narin left the path and headed towards her house and then arrived in front of the barn,\n\nIt is established by the narrowed cell-site data that the defendant Nevzat was near the scene,\nHowever, in view of the proximity of the defendant’s house to the house of the complainant Arif,\n\nthis matter was not assessed by our Court to the detriment of the defendant.\nThat the defendant,\n\nWent to the house of Arif Güran upon Salim’s call,\nWhen he entered the house, the doors of the rooms were closed and it was understood that the deceased Narin’s lifeless body was on the floor,\nThereafter, upon the direction of the defendant Salim, he took the deceased Narin’s lifeless body and left the house and took it to his barn,\nFrom there he placed it in a sack and put it in his own car,\nThereafter, he took it to the Eğertutmaz creek, which was the place indicated by the defendant Salim, and concealed the sack containing the lifeless body by placing stones on it at the creek bank,\n\nhas been accepted by our Court.\nAlthough at various stages the defendant Nevzat stated that he took the lifeless body because the defendant Salim threatened him,\n\nAfter the arrest of the defendant Salim, while thousands of law enforcement personnel were searching for the deceased Narin throughout the village, the threat had ceased to exist,\nAnd although the defendant Nevzat could very easily have ensured the discovery of the deceased Narin by telling the truth, he did not do so and, by insisting on the act he carried out, demonstrated his intent,\nTherefore, the situation regulated in Article 28 of the TPC did not occur in the concrete case,\n\nhas been accepted by our Court.\n\nTaking into account the above statements and the findings made with respect to the other defendants; in the concrete case, our Court has concluded that the defendant Nevzat was not at the scene at the moment of the deceased Narin’s death and did not participate in the killing act; that he came to the house of Arif Güran upon the call of the defendant Salim; that when he arrived at the house, he saw the deceased Narin’s lifeless body; that from that time onwards, since the killing act had been completed, the acts committed in response to this act cannot be accepted as participation; and that here the acts of the defendant will clearly give rise to another offense.\nAlthough the other defendants and the defense counsel for the other defendants alleged that the deceased Narin was killed by the defendant Nevzat;\n\nThat there was no enmity or motive that would require the defendant Nevzat to kill the deceased Narin,\nAgain, in the UKB report obtained for the enhancement of the DARAN-2 camera recordings, it was established that there was a moving dark figure in the direction of the house–barn,\nThat our Court accepted that, because this figure appeared to be of dark-colored clothing and of short, thin build, it was the deceased Narin,\nIn view of this situation, that the deceased Narin was killed in the house, the barn, or its extensions,\nMoreover, that in the report regarding the macroscopic and microscopic examination of the hair samples found on Narin’s hand and clothing, conducted by the Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institute, it was specifically stated that no finding regarding the defendant Nevzat or determination regarding DNA was made,\nThat this situation means the defendant did not participate in the killing of the deceased Narin,\nThat again, in other previously obtained reports, it was stated that there was no determination regarding the defendant Nevzat,\n\nin view of these, our Court did not give credence to the allegations of the other defendants and the other defendants’ counsel. Although the counsel for the participating institutions alleged that when the defendant Nevzat took the deceased Narin, the death event had not yet been medically established, and therefore the defendant was jointly liable together with the other defendants,\n\nIn the statements of the defendant, credited by our Court, he said that when he arrived at the house, the deceased Narin’s lifeless body was on the floor and fluids were flowing from her mouth,\nThere is no concrete evidence in the file showing the contrary of the defendant’s statements,\nTherefore, by the time the defendant arrived at the house, the death event had been completed,\nAgain, as detailed above, after the other defendants, acting in participation, completed the death event, they decided what they would do and then called the defendant Nevzat, and by telling him something untrue (the alleged relationship between the defendant Salim and Yüksel), they attempted to conceal the facts,\n\nin view of these, the requests of the counsel for the participating institutions and the opinion of the prosecution have not been accepted by our Court.\nAs for the defendant Nevzat,\n\nBy taking the deceased Narin’s lifeless body to the Eğertutmaz creek and concealing it,\nBy failing to provide any information or document to the law enforcement officers who carried out search operations until the date the said lifeless body was found,\nAnd in the incident that developed such that, upon examination of the camera recordings, the red-colored vehicle used by the defendant was identified and the defendant was apprehended, his act constituted not the offense of intentionally killing the deceased Narin together with the other defendants but the offense regulated in Article 281 of the TPC of Destroying, concealing, or altering evidence of the offense,\nIn view of the time elapsed from the date the deceased Narin was killed to the date her lifeless body was found, and the fact that during this period the evidence of the offense (despite dozens of examinations carried out by the Forensic Medicine Institutions, no evidence was found, and the reason for the absence of evidence is that the said lifeless body remained in water for a long time) could not be found,\n\nin view of the “penalty from 6 months to 5 years” specified in Article 281 of the TPC, a prison sentence of 4 years and 6 months has been imposed and judgment has been rendered as set out below."

    "text": "Av. Furkan ÇAKIR ​\n\nYüksel Güran’ın Masumiyetine İnanış ​\nŞimdi savunmalarımızdan önce küçük bir cümle ile başlamak istiyorum. Kimse kolay kolay Allah benim vekilimdir diyemez. Sizin alnınız açık olsun, siz benim temsilcilerimizsiniz. Bunun kişi Yüksel Güran, dosya aşaması boyunca zaman zaman kendisiyle hem sürekli cezaevinde bir görüşmeler yaptık. Kendisi her zaman bize bu hususta sebatla aynı kelimeleri aynı cümleleri kurdu ve kurmaya devam ediyor. Alnı açık, bizim de açık şu vakte kadar herkes biliyor ki, gerek sosyal medyadan gerekse mensubu olduğumuz baroya gönderilen mektuplar ile mesajlar ile faks ile birçok saldırıya uğradık. Avukat olarak biz bu saldırıya uğradığımız zaman geri çekilebilirdik, çekilmedik çünkü… niye çalışmıyor, kıymetli başkan.\n\n\nMasumiyet İddiası ve Soruşturma Aşamasındaki Usulsüzlükler ​\nBiz saldırılardan sonra geri çekilebilirdik, çekilmedik çünkü niye? Aslında bizim bir amacımız vardı, bir şiar’ımız vardı. Biz Yüksel Güran’ın masum olduğunu iddia eden, bilen bir grup insandık. Aslında Yüksel Güran da bize bunu ısrarla hissettirdi, hissettirmeye de devam etti. Biz dosyayı aldığımız zaman dosyayı inceledik, Yüksel Güran’ın şu dosyaya dahil edilmesini gerektiren değil kuvvetli bir suç şüphesi, normal basit bir şüpheden dahi tahkikat başlatılır. Ya zannımızca başta bir öyle şüphe dahi yoktu. Ne yazık ki eklendi, tutuklandı ve bu süre zarfına kadar da tutukluluğu devam ediyor. Biz bunları defaatle dile getirdik. Sosyal medyada bize küfürler dahi edildi, umursamadık. Şu an burada savunma yapan arkadaşlarımız oldu. Birbirimiz ile dahi birbirimizle dahi böyle sözlü sataşma mahiyetine varacak cümlelerimiz oldu. Biz bunları istemiyorduk, aslında tek isteğimiz kendimizi olabildiği kadar açık ve sahih şekilde dile getirmekti. Biz bunu söylüyoruz. Savunmalarımıza öf eden pöf eden çok insan var, biz bunun da farkındayız. Ama bunlar bir gerçek, bunlar söylenir, kendi süzgecinizden geçirirsiniz, mahkeme tasnifi ile siz de buna bir karar verebilirsiniz. Vicdani boyutta ama gerçek kararı verecek kişiler unutmayınız ki hakimlerdir. Şimdi biz başından itibaren defaatle şunu söyledik; dedik ki, soruşturma aşaması yapıldı. Nasıl yapıldı? Nasıl ilerlendi? Kerhen ittire ittire nasıl götürüldü, söyledik. Tekrar söyleyeyim, ben size soruşturma aşamasından itibaren Güran ailesi bu dosyanın başına monta ettirildi ve tüm çalışmalar bu sektede yapıldı. Biz bunları söyledik. Şimdi bu söylemlerimizi Nahit başkanın bir sözü var; der ki, ben bir şey söylersem desteklerim, biz de destekledik. Dedik ki, soruşturma aşamasının başında tutulan tutanaklar var. Tutanaklar kim tarafından tutuldu? JASAT tarafından tutuldu, ilgili ekip tarafından tutuldu, kolluk tarafından tutuldu. Biz bu tutanakları hukuki mahiyette hiçbir gerçek inandırıcı ya da tartışmaya mahal vermeyecek kadar kudretli delil olarak göremeyiz. Bunu kabul eden meslektaşlarımız vardı. Biz diyoruz ki, bir tutanak tutuldu. Bu bir zandır.\n\n\nTutanaklardaki Çelişkiler ve Usul Kurallarının İhlali ​\nEvet bir çalışma yapılır, bu çalışma doğrultusunda bir destekleme yapılırsa devamı getirilir ama ne yazık ki, gördük ki tutanaklar yorumlandı. Tutanaklar iddianame dosyalara farklı aksedildi. Bunun örneklerini ben açık bir şekilde söyleyeceğim. Şimdi 31/08/2024 tarihinde jandarmanın tutmuş olduğu bir tutanak var. Altında tutanağı tutan memurların imzası var. Ne diyor orada biliyor musunuz? Diyor ki, “Bizim yapmış olduğumuz mahal araştırmalarında Narin kızımızın en son görülmüş olduğu nokta evinin yakın civarında olduğu, kaybolduğu düşünülen en son noktanın çevrelerinde ya da çoğunlukla Güran mensubu ailelerin bulunduğu” söyleniyor. Şimdi biz ne diyoruz? Başından itibaren diyoruz ki, bir kamera kaydı var. Bizzat okul tarafından çekilen ve Narin kızımın 15:11:14 saatinde son olarak görüldüğü yer kamerası o kamera kaydı bize aslında her şeyi açıklamaya yeterli ya da bir tahkikat başlatılacaksa o tahkikatın nereye yönelmesini gösterecek bir delildi. Görüldüğü en son nokta neydi? Aslında evinin civarından ziyade dosyamızın sanığı olan Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın evinin dibiydi. Biz bunları söyledik. Peki biz söylediğimiz zaman ya da jandarma tutanaklarına bunlar yansıtılmadığı zaman bizim söylemlerimiz neden kötü sanılıyor? Usul herkese lazım. Şimdi yapmış olduğumuz değerlendirmeler her zaman usul yönünde. Ne diyoruz? usul esasa mukaddemdir. Yargıtayın çoğu bozma kararı ne diyor? Diyor ki, “Usul esasa takaddüm eder”. Yani diyor ki, sen usulü önce yapacaksın, usulün doğru ise ben esası inceleyeceğim. Şimdi şekil açısından yapılan tutanakların ne kadar aksettirildiğine ne kadar yanlış geçirildiğini söylediğimiz zaman bu bir eksikliktir. Esasa geçemezsin. Sen ama ittirildi bazı şeyler, bazı şeyler zora sokuldu. Biz bunu görmezden geldik. Dedik ki, insanidir, beşeridir. Herkes hata yapabilir. Devamını getirdik. Biz ne diyoruz biliyor musunuz? Diyor ki 02/09/2024 tarihinde jandarma tarafından tutulan bir tutanak daha var. Jandarma personelinin bizzat müvekkilimiz Yüksel Güran ile görüştüğüne ilişkin mülakat tutanağı ya da görüşme tutanağı, her neyse, tutanağı olduğu gibi size okuyorum. Diyor ki, “Narin Güran’ın akıbeti belli olmadığı halde kızının öldüğünü düşündüğü”. İddianamede ne yazıyor? Hemen dördüncü sayfaya bakalım.\n\n\nKızı Öldüğünden Emin Olduğu İddiası ve Delil Üretme Çabası ​\nKızının öldüğünden adeta emin olduğu yazıyor. Ben bir tutanak tutuyorum, burada veriyorum. İlgili merciye, ilgili mahkemesine o merci orayı değiştirip ekliyor. Buraya geçersizdir, yapılamaz, yapılması muktedir değildir. Herkes biliyor bunu. Siz de biliyorsunuz, katılan vekilleri de biliyor. Biz bunu dile getiriyoruz. Diyoruz ki, siz zehirli elmayı kullanıyorsunuz, yiyorsunuz. Yemeyin, esasa geçeceğiz. Çünkü geçtik bir şekilde onu da geçiyorum. Narin kızımızın naaşının bulunmasından bir gün evvel, hani dedik ya, Güran ailesi o dosyaya monte edildi. O dosyaya icabında kolları dikildi, bacakları dikildi. Bir şekilde elbise çıkarılmaya çalışılıyor. Narin kızımız daha bulunmamış. Cesedinin, hukuki nitelendirme olarak söylüyorum, cesedinin bir çuval içerisinde olduğu bilinmiyor daha. Bir gün öncesi, yani 07/09/2024 tarihinde jandarma Arif Güran’ın evine gidiyor, biliyor musunuz? Arif Güran’ın evinde 6 tane çuvalın fotoğrafını çekiyor. Jandarmanın bu hareketi size normal geliyor mu? Bir aklıselim olan iradesi, sebat tutulan bir insan benim karşıma gelsin desin ki, normaldir? Değil. Bir tutanak daha var 08/09/2024 tarihinde Narin kızımızın cesedinin bulunduğu gün tutulmuş. Bu tutanağa göre Yüksel Güran’ın, yani Arif Güran’ın evinin civarında bir kavga olmuş, bu kavga bizzat itirerek yazılmış, iddia edilmiş, söylenmiş, mercisine ulaştırılmış. Tutanakta ne yazıyor biliyor musunuz? Yüksel Güran’ın evine dönülerek, Yüksel Güran’ın evine dönerek, çok özür diliyorum, orospu diye hitap edildi. Evine dönerek biz ilk celse duruşmasında ne yaptık? Sorgu aşamasında geçtik tanıklarımız dinlendi, sanıklar dinlendi. Gelen tanıkların tamamı ne dedi? Bize dedi ki, Yüksel Güran Narin kızımızın vefat haberini alınca biyolojik anlamda çöktü, ambulansa alındı. Tedavi altına alındı. Dolayısıyla bu kavganın mı malinde bulunması mümkün değil. Bu bizim duyum delil dediğimiz, beyan delil dediğimiz tanık ifadeleri ile görgü ifadeleri ile sabit aslında. Ama yine bu tutanağa Yüksel Güran monta ettirildi. Dedi ki, “sen oradasın, sen orada değilsin. Ama seni orada göstermek zorundayız.” denildi. Aslında peki bu iddianamede bu cümle nasıl geçiyor biliyor musunuz?\n\n\nSoruşturma Savcısının Hataları ve Delil Yetersizliği ​\nEvine demiş olduğu cümle Yüksel Güran’a karşı, bir tutanak tutuluyor ve bu tutanak yanlış bir şekilde iddianameye geçiriliyor. Ben bunu söylemeyeyim mi? Söyleyeceğim çünkü usul esasa mukaddestir. Sen usulü yap, esasa ben sonra bakarım demektir. Bu, geçtim bunları, hani soruşturma aşaması şekil açısından, usul açısından çok güzel gitmiş ya biz esasa geçtik. Aslında hiç gitmemiş. Burada bulunan tüm avukatlar aslında şunu çok iyi biliyor, bu dosya usulden de esastan da verilen her karar bozulacak, burada verilen karara hukuki nitelendirme anlamında güvenecek kimse olmayacak aslında. Çünkü niye, yapılan hatalar var eksiklikler var. Bunlar yapılmaması gerekiyordu. Ama soruşturmanın savcıları yaptı. Ha ben şunu bir avukat olarak söylemek istemezdim. Dosyamızın savcısı da aynı kudretle, aynı ağız ile gidiyor. Ona da geleceğim. Onu söyleyeceğim. Ben ben burada bir tartışma açmıyorum ama söyleyeceğim. Söylenmesi gerekiyor. Çünkü, şimdi çoğunuz görmüştür, dosyayı inceleyenler bilir. Daha 21/09/2024 tarihine kadar Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın son ifadesi, yani Yüksel Güran’ı o iffetsiz davranışa soktuğu son ifadesi 21/09/2024, o tarihe kadar müvekkilimiz belli başlı kendini bilmez, aymaz sosyal medya şarlatanları tarafından bir iddia ile suçlandı. Onun dışında dosyada bunu gösterir muktedir bir delil yok. Neden soruşturma savcısı 31/08/2024 tarihinde Narin’in cesedini aramak yerine ne yaptı, biliyor musunuz? Narin kızımızın Yüksel Güran’ın ve Arif Güran’ın Yüksel’den ve Arif’ten olma olup olmadığı yönünde bir DNA raporu aldı. Cinayet dosyası olarak değerlendirilebilen ama normalde ilk dakikada kayıp vaka olarak nitelendirilen bir dosya alır alınmaz mümkün değil ama siz yaptınız. Soruşturma savcıları yaptı. Bunu niye yaptı biz bunları söylüyoruz. Bize bir cevap veren oldu mu? Hayır. Olmayacak da. Ben bunu biliyor muyum? Olmayacak. Şimdi bu hususta bir durum var, bir gerçek var. Hani dedik ya, 21/09/2024 tarihinde böyle bir iffetsiz bir yakıştırma yapıldı, o yakıştırmadan sonra bir de Yüksel hanımın amca ile ilişkisi, çok özür diliyorum, çok özür diliyorum, Yüksel hanımın amca ile ilişkisi var denildi ve tüm aile mensuplarının bu yönde HTS kayıtları alındı. Şaşırtıcı. Gerçekten çok şaşırtıcı!\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın İtirafçı Vasfı ve Parmak Sallama Tehdidi ​\nKimin söylediğini hatırlamıyorum, bir katılan vekilimiz vardı. Diyarbakır Barosu’nun yetkili temsilcisi. İyi de etti. Ağzına sağlık. Dedi ki, Nevzat Bahtiyar zaten mütalaada da geçmiyor. Zaten yanlış anlaşılmasın, Nevzat Bahtiyar itirafçı olamaz. Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın itirafçı olabilmesi için şartlar zaten yok. Nevzat Bahtiyar’ı sosyal medyada itirafçı olarak gören herkes bu dosyaya diyorlar ya Güran’lar hepsi suçludur, sen bunu söylediğin için suçlusun. Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın usulen itirafçı olabilmesi için bir cerayim dosyasında bir adli vakada olaya asli ve feri fail olarak katılmış olması lazım. Hukuki konusunu bilmesi lazım. Diyecek ki, ben bu olayın bu şekilde olduğunu biliyorum ya da ben gerçekleştirdim. Bu şekilde oldu. Bu husustaki ince çizgi ne biliyor musunuz? Sebat. Yani siz bir şekilde itirafçı olduktan sonra beyanlarınızı değiştiremezsiniz. Değiştiriyorsanız ise itirafçı olamazsınız. Bu benim sözüm değil kanunun sözü. Yani kanun burada emrediyor. Yani diyor ki, sen bunu itirafçı olarak değerlendiremezsiniz. Ne yaptılar? Dediler ki, Nevzat Bahtiyar itirafçı olması lazım. Olamaz mümkün değil. Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın hukuki nitelendirilmesi bellidir. Biz kimseye bazı vekillerimizin söylemiş olduğu gibi katildir demiyoruz. Hukuki nitelendirilmesi bellidir. Çok önemli bir konu var aslında. Biraz da bağımsız olacak ama bir parmak sallama mevzusu var. Bu aralar çok popüler. Herkes herkese parmak sallıyor. Dünkü duruşmada bir vekilimiz böyle sanıkların çoğunluğunun olduğu bir tarafa parmak salladı. Şimdi kendisinin tutumu tamamen mesleki düsturu nedir, bilmem. Tamamen yakıştırmayı ise kendisine bırakıyorum ama parmak birgün gelir, seni gösterir. O parmağı gösterecek had sende yok, gösteremezsin. Yüksel Güran bugün ne dedi? Bize dedi ki, jandarmada bana parmak gösterdiler. Dedi, sen biliyorsun, konuşmuyorsun dediler. O jandarma personeli burada mı bilmiyorum, yarın bir gün o parmak seni gösterir. Sen de savunulmaya muhtaç olduğunu o zaman anlarsın. Umarım sesim geliyordur sana. Şimdi aslında çok sıkmamaya çalışacağım. Dediğim gibi bunlar önemli. Bunlar dosyanın icabında, firisinde, müddeabihinde bulunan şeyler. Sizin de değerlendirmesi gerekiyor. Değerlendirin.\n\n\nGörgü Tanığı İfadelerindeki Hataların Bilişsel Teorisi ile Açıklanması ​\nBurada kararı verecek kişiler mahkemelerdir, hakimlerdir. Ama bunun değerlendirilmesi Türk vicdanı adına, tüm vicdan adına, millet adına yapılır. Bunu biz de değerlendirelim. Şimdi şeyden bahsediyorlar. Başkanım bazı tanıklar, hatta bazı demeyeyim, daha iddialı konuşayım, değil mi? Diyorlar ki, Güran ailesinin birçoğu, hatta hepsi kolluk personellerini, hatta savcıları yanılttı. Jandarma komutanını da yanılttı diyorlar. Nasıl yaptılar bunu? İki üç kişinin zaman konusunda, bakın altını çiziyorum, zaman konusunda göstermiş olduğu yanlış bilgilerini ya da o an zihninin onu dışa vurması, şimdi ben gerçek anlamda bunu araştırdım. Şimdi bizim ceza muhakememizde belki kıymetli başkanım bilir, bilişsel teori uygulanmıyor. Bilişsel teori nedir? Bilişsel teori şudur. Diyor ki, sen gerçekliği arayan bir mercisin ve bu gerçekliğe ulaşma kudreti senin elinde ve bu sen gerçekliği değerlendirirken muhakkak üç faktörden yararlanmak zorundasın. Ne diyor? Diyor ki, zaman. Diyor ki mekan. Diyor ki tasnif, yani hareketlilik. Bunlardan bir tanesini zihin yanıltıcı olarak ortaya çıkarırsa, zihnin kurmuş olduğu loglor, yani şemadan kaynaklıdır. Sen bunu söyledin. Gerçeklikle sıkıntılı olan bir durum değil, diyor ki bunu zihin kusuyor zaten. Niye kusuyor biliyor musunuz? Yapılan araştırmalara göre diyor ki, zihin şu sebeplerden dolayı bu bilgileri kusabilir. Yani yaşanmış ama tasnifsel anlamda, zamansal anlamda nasıl bir yanlışın ortaya çıkarıldığını aslında zihin bize gösteriyor. Bu insan biyolojisinin aslında bir ürünü şimdi araştırmaların bir yerinde çok kıymetli bir söz geçiyordu. Ne diyordu biliyor musunuz? Diyordu ki, görgü tanığı ifade alınması ya da bilgi beyanı alındığı sırada kolluk personelinin avukatın veya hakimin veya savcının her kimse diyor ki, tutumu dahi o zihni yanlış yönlendirmeye muktedirdir diyor. Yani nedir bu biliyor musunuz? Aslında zihinde böyle şeyler var. Doğru, zihin bunu kabul ediyor ama o an siz onu zorluyorsunuz ya, hani biz dedik ya, Güran’lar monte ettirildi, bu dosyaya eklendi diyoruz. Ya aslında bunun bir kusmasıdır bu. Bunu ben söylemiyorum. Hatta ne diyorlar biliyor musunuz? Bir suç kamuya duyurulduğu zaman görgü tanığı olayın kaynağına yönelik hatalı atıfta bulunabilir.\n\n\nHatalı Yargılamalara Yol Açan Faktörler ve Görgü Tanığı Beyanlarının Güvenilirliği ​\nŞimdi 1932 yılında Bartlett denilen bir araştırmacı yazar hiç işi yok bunu araştırmış. Hatta kendi güruhunu da toplamış, tabi yani değerlendirilmesi size kalmış bir durumdur. Diyor ki, bir olayın sıklıkla tekrarlanmasını istediğiniz zaman o olayı da yanlış bilgiyi yanlış bir şekilde dönüşler mümkündür. Bunun örneğini nasıl veriyor biliyor musunuz? Diyor ki, bir gruba, 100 kişilik bir gruba bir olay anlatılıyor. Bu olayın sürekli tekrarlanmasını istiyor ve her biri belli bir tekrarlanmadan sonra yanlış beyanda, zamansal ve mekansal bir hareketlilik yanlış beyanda bulunabiliyor. Gerçeklikle sıkıntısı var mı? Yok. Ama nedir? Zihin bunu kusuyor. Aslında ben bunu niye söylüyorum? Aslında Yüksel Güran’ın beyanlarında okuyanlar bilir bir sıkıntı yok. Aslında şu ana kadar öyle bir isnat da yok, iddia da yok, izafe edilen bir cürüm de yok ama bu dosyanın tamamı itibari ile söylemek zorundayım. Ben yanına şunu ekleyeyim; ben şimdi ceza yargılamasında aslında çok böyle amiyane bir tabirdir, pardon özür dilerim, yargı makamı hata yaptı, devlet hata yaptı gibi kelimeler kullanılmaz. Niye biliyor musunuz? Çünkü ceza yargılamasında usul bellidir. Usul şudur. Ben bir yargılama yaparım denetimi var, denetimin denetimi var, olağan kanun yolu var. Olağanüstü kanun yolları diyor ki, sen hakkın olan şeyi illaki alırsın ya da hakkın varsa zarar görmezsin. Bunu kanun söylüyor ama diyor ki, yapılan yargılamaların, hatalı yargılamaların, bozulan yargılamaların 5 tane ana faktörü var diyor. Buradaki herkese sorsam herkes bir faktör söyler. Bana ben size 5 faktör sayacağım. 5 faktörden bir tanesinin bu dosyadan olmadığını bana iddia edin, ispatlayın, şu an savunmalarımı burada bırakırım. Ne diyor biliyor musunuz? Diyor ki, yargılamada aceleci olmak, soruşturma aşamasının nasıl gittiğini biliyoruz, herkes biliyor, kovuşturma aşamasının da nasıl gittiğini biliyoruz. Herkes biliyor çünkü bir acele var, bir baskı var, sanki kolluk birimlerinin kolluk birimlerinin olayı aydınlatma isteği. Ne dedik? Dedik ki, kolluk birimleri belli başlı durumlarda emir telaki veya gayrı durumlarda bir iş yapıyor, bir tutanak tutuyor. Diyor ki, bunlar bunlar var ama belki yoktur. Ne diyor? Bunun denetimini siz yapın, hukuk mecrası yapsın diyor.\n\n\nYargılamadaki Hataların Toplumsal Etkisi ve Mütalaanın Eksikliği ​\nÇünkü benim orada denetimi yapacak gücüm kudretim yok diyor aslında. Bana sunuyor bunu. Yapıldı mı, yapılmadı mı? Yorum ne diyor biliyor musunuz? Diyor ki, dosyada bulunan dosya firisinde bulunan müfrez belgelere siz yorum yapamazsınız. Bir yere mi gönderiyorsunuz? Bir mütalaa mı veriyorsunuz? Bir iddianame mi hazırlıyorsunuz? Bunu değiştiremezsiniz diyor. Yapıyorsan ise hata yapıyorsun diyor. Ben demiyorum. Şüpheli veya sanığın suçlu görme iradesi bu herkese tanıdık geldi. Şüpheli veya sanığı suçlu görme iradesi bu konuda zerre açıklama yapmayacağım çünkü neyse, toplumsal ve sosyal yapı, baskı ben 5 faktör saydım. Bu 5 faktörü zamanında Türkiye Cumhuriyeti devletinde yapılan yargılamaların ne kadar hatalı olduğunu gösteren çalışma yapan aslında insanlar sunmuş ben değil. Bu 5 faktörden hangisi bizim dosyamızda yok? Hepsi var. Şimdi örnektir, başkanım diyor ya farklı yöne çekilmesini istemiyorum. Tamamen örnektir yani, hatalı yapılan yargılamaların ne kadar insan hayatında kırıcı yıkıcı etkilerini gösterir. Bir örnektir, gerçektir. Gerçek hayattan esinlenmiştir. Şimdi İstanbul 2002 yılında Ümraniye’de bir arkadaşımız ya da bir şahıs tecavüz suçlamasıyla alınıyor, yargılaması başlatılıyor ve o kişi tanık beyanları ile görgü beyanları ile diyor ki, sizin bize söylemiş olduğunuz eşkal, bu adam, o an burada geçti diyor. Ben bunu gördüm ve kolluk bir şekilde bu kişiyi buluyor ve 21 gün boyunca bu adam tutuklu kalıyor. Tabi ki 2002 yılı o dönem araştırmalar, DNA hiçbir şekilde hızlı yapılmıyor, yapılması zaten mümkün değil. Tamı tamına 21 gün sonra rapor geliyor, raporda DNA’nın tutuklanan kişiyle uyumlu olmadığı çıkıyor. Kişi serbest. Peki serbest kaldıktan sonra kişinin bünyesinde bırakmış olduğu yıkıcı yıpratıcı etki hemen geçti mi? Geçmez. O yüzden devlet makamlarında yargılama yapan makamlarında pardon, özür diliyorum, yargı hata yaptı denilmez. Denilmemesi de gerekiyor. Şimdi biraz da mütalaa boyutunu değerlendireyim. Şimdi mütalaada benim müvekkilim yönünden Yüksel Güran yönünden ne deniliyor biliyor musunuz? Eylemsellik yönünden hiçbir şey denilmiyor. Yani bu kişinin eyleminin var olup olmadığı bilinmiyor. Aslında diyor ki bence var.\n\n\nMütalaanın İçeriği ve Baz Raporunun Geçersizliği ​\nSen orada isen ya da orada olduğunu gösterir bir rapor var ise, bence var diyor ama eylemi mütalaada Yüksel Güran’ın aslında müşterek fail diyorlar ya, iştirak iradesine diyorlar ya, ortak hakimiyet diyorlar ya o iradede olduğunu gösterir. Ya mütalaada söylenen dört unsur var. Ne diyor? Diyor ki, ailenin aşamalarda yanlış yönlendirildiği, kolluk birimlerinin aile yanlış yönlendirmiş diyorlar. Çocuk yaştaki çocuklar dahi kolluk makamlarına yanlış bilgi vermiş diyorlar. Baz raporu bu başından itibaren 7 Kasım’dan itibaren ucube olarak nitelendirdiğimiz baz raporu, tamamıyla teknik bilgileri ile ne kadar yanlış bilirkişi raporu vasfı niteliğinde olmayan bir rapor hatta kağıt ürünü kağıt ürünü, bu mevzular ortak hakimiyet olarak nitelendiriliyor. Şimdi ben üç tane ceza genel kurulu iştihadi birleştirme emsal kararı buldum. Burada bahsedilen, burada bahsedilen ortak hakimiyetin tasnifi ile mütalaada bahsedilen tasnif aynı değil. Dedim ya hani ben savcı hanıma da bir şey söyleyeceğim. Savcı hanım mütalaasında bir emsal karara değinmiş. Çokta güzel yapmış ama o kararı dünkü bir meslektaşımız söyledi belli ki kopyala yapıştır yapmış olabilir ya da aklında kalanı yazmış olabilir. Ama kırıcı o vurucu noktasına değinmemiş. Niye değinmemiş? Hani dedik ya soruşturma aşaması başından itibaren Güran ailesinin o dosyaya entegre edilmesiyle yürütülüyor. Peki ben size şeyi hatırlatayım, ceza muhakemesi kanunu 215 kıymetli başkan ne diyor? Orada diyor ki, mütalaanın verileceği zaman bellidir. Mütalaa tüm deliller toplandıktan tüm beyanlar alındıktan sonra kül halinde, kül halinde bir değerlendirme, bir değerlendirme sonucu iddia makamı tarafından verilir diyor. Mütalaa ne zaman verildi? Ne zaman bize tebliğ edildi? Daha bizim talep etmiş olduğumuz sizin resen istemiş olduğunuz belgeler daha dosyaya celp edilmeden verildi. Şimdi siz diyorsunuz ki, bu bir usuldür. Bu bir usul olamaz çünkü niye bunu bana kanun tarif ediyor diyor ki, sen böyle yapacaksın diyor. Belki belgeler o mütalaayı hatalı çıkaracak ya da o belgeler doğrultusunda, madem dosya alındı. Mütalaada neden değinilmiyor? Değinildi, ama suç duyurusunda. Bunlar hatalı şeyler. Yapılmaması gereken şeyler. Biz bunu söylüyoruz. Diyoruz ki, bir şey yapıyorsunuz ise usule uygun yapın.\n\n\nOrtak Hakimiyet İddiasının Çürütülmesi ve Masumiyet Karinesi ​\nKıymetli başkanımız başından itibaren şunu söylüyor. Mahkeme başkanı diyor ki “Ben usulleri çok iyi yaparım” ki yaptı da. Evet. Evet şimdi biz de dedik ki şeklen ve kerhen bu dosya soruşturma aşaması, mütalaa aşaması, kovuşturma aşaması ittirilerek gidiyor dedik ve bunu söylediğimiz zaman dediğimiz gibi belli başlı baskılar gördük. Hakaretler işittik. Geri çekildik mi? Hayır. Niye? Anlatacağız. Anlatmaya devam edeceğiz. Bunlar söylenmesi gereken şeyler. Şimdi ortak hakimiyet mevzusu. Hani diyorlar ya Yüksel Güran diğer üç sanık ile beraber ortak bir irade ile hareket etmiş, çocuğunu öldürmüş. Ama eylemsel olarak hareketsellik tarifi belirtmiyor. Ama diyor ki, yapmışsın diyor. Ama diyor öyle bir izlenim var diyor. Şimdi dedim ya üç tane emsal karar ben bunları öncesinden sunayım size. Siz bir değerlendirin. Şimdi oradaki tasvip bellidir. Kimse mesela usulü anlamda evet herkes bir doktrin yapmak ister, herkes bir görüş yapmak ister ama bunun sınırları bellidir. Biz olabildiği ölçüde hukuk insanları olarak, avukatlar olarak belki içimizde başka meslekten olmayı düşünen insanlar da vardır ama bizim her şeyden önce normal hayatta, normal hayatta dahi usule uymak zorundayız. Her şeyin bir usulü vardır ve ceza muhakemesi kanununda bir usulü vardır. Uyulmadı. Biz uyulmadığını söylüyoruz. Şimdi şu elimde gördüğünüz belge ne biliyor musunuz? Bu benim müvekkilimin telefonundan alınan ekran kaydı ekran kaydı arama kayıtlarını gösteriyor. Müvekkilim, başından itibaren ifadelerinde ne söylüyor? Çelişki. Gördünüz mü? Görmediniz. Zamansal, mekansal anlamda bir sıkıntı gördünüz mü? Görmediniz. Müvekkilimi destekleyen bir kayıt var. Buruda ne diyor? Diyor ki, ben saat 9 sıralarında 10 sıralarında kardeşimi aradım diyor. Bakın kayıt dosyada var. Ondan sonra Hediye’yi aradım diyor. Hediye ile görüştüm diyor. Hediye ne diyor? Müvekkilimi destekliyor mu? Destekliyor. Peki burada fikirsel ve eylemsel olarak ortak hakimiyet nasıl kuruluyor? Biri bana bunu anlatsın. Desin ki, ortak hakimiyet şu şekilde kurulur, kurulmaz. Bu dosyada müvekkilimiz yönünden ortak hakimiyet kurulması mümkün değil. Şimdi özellikle sosyal medyacıların çok iyi bildiği bir ilke var. Sosyal medyacılar bunu çok iyi biliyor. Masumiyet karinesi Avrupa İnsan Hakları sözleşmesinde de geçer.\n\n\nYüksel Güran’ın Tutukluluğu İçin Yeterli Delil Yokluğu ve Temel Delillerin Zayıflığı ​\nBir çok ülke devletin bizzat başka konut yapıcı, yapmış olduğu bir madde Türkiye Cumhuriyetinde de öyledir. Masumiyet karinesi. Bir düşünmek istemiyorum ama tahayyül edeceğim. Tahayyül edeceğim. Ben bu dosyada bu şekilde yargılanmış olsaydım ve dosya bu kerte de olsaydı, ben üzülürdüm. Gerçek anlamda beni içeride Yüksel Güran’ı içeride tutabilecek, yani kıymetli bir delil yok. Gerçekten yok. Yani şimdi harici bilgiler dosyaya söylenmez ama bizim konuşmuş insanlar ile de bize de şunu soruyor. Yüksel Güran niye tutuklu Yüksel Güran 21/09/2024 tarihinden öncesi tutuklanmış olabilir, 21/09/2024 tarihinde Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın o son ifadesi var ya itirafçı Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın son ifadesi. Orada iffetsiz akla uymayacak ve tahayyül’ü izahı oluşu yapılmamış bir iddia var. Ne diyor orada? Diyor ki “Ben kıymetli Narin’i, Narin kızımızı aldım araca koydum. Araca binme pozisyonundayken arkaya baktım. Yüksel Güran iki elini böyle yapmış ağlıyordu”. Şimdi Yüksel Güran’ın gerçek anlamda orada olmadığı ya da olma iradesinin bulunmadığı dosyanın tüm aşamalarında kerte kerte kerte söylendi. Bunu söyleyen, bunu söyleyen bir ifade var. Bir ifade diyor ki, oradaydı diyor. Yetinilmedi, çok öncesi alınan, bak çok öncesi alınan ama daha sonradan farklı saatler ile farklı kayıtları ile dosyaya sunulan baz analiz raporu var. Baz analiz raporunda Yüksel Güran dedi ki, cinayet mahalli evdir, ev gösterildi, oda oda tarifler yapıldı. Dedi ki, cinayet burada işlenmiş, dört kişi burada fiili hakimiyet kurmuş, ortak hakimiyeti var, bunlar beraber hareket ediliyor dedi. Şimdi ben de tekrardan sizi sıkmak için o teknik aksaklıklara mı gireyim? Girmeyeceğim çünkü baz raporunun gerçek anlamda bilirkişi raporu olmadığını her aşamada söyledik, söylüyoruz. Ben bu aşamada tekrardan söylemeyeyim. Dolayısıyla bu iki delil iddianamenin ve mütalaanın bu belki kemiğini oluşturan, iddianameyi böyle şaha kaldıran, iddianamenin tanzim edilmesini sağlayan o delil var ya, aslında çok özür diliyorum, kağıt parçası, dosyaya hiçbir katkı sağlamadı. Ek rapor alındı, talep ettik alınmadı mı? alındı. Ne diyor? Orada diyor ki ben söylediysem doğrudur. Denetimi bana sundu mu? Sunmadı.\n\n\nUzman Raporlarının Güvenilirliği ve Delillerin Teknik Doğrulanması Talebi ​\nPeki ben bu bilirkişi olarak imza atan, imzaları da farklıymış da, neyse bilirkişi olarak dosyaya sunan kişilerin bilirkişi olduğunu da bilmiyorum. Uzmanlık alanlarının da ne olduğunu bilmiyorum. Bilmem mümkün değil çünkü, niye, bana bunun izahatı yapılmadı. Ceza muhakemesinin hükmü açıktır. Sizin bunu aslında dosyaya hiç koymamanız lazımdı. Soruşturma aşamasında savcılar bunu dosyaya koymaması lazımdı. Şimdi burada katılan vekilleri, özelikle bakanlık vekilleri şöyle yaptı. Dedi ki “Baz raporları doğrudur, iman ettik buna”. Ya bu yönde emsal kararlar sundu, şimdi ben şunu söylüyorum. Ben demiyorum baz raporu yapılırsa denetimi bana caiz tutulursa, bana denetimini gösterirse yıpranma payını esneme payını bana gösterirse ben de kabul edeyim. Yok. Sizin sunmuş olduğunuz emsal kararlarda baz raporunu bana getirin, aynı bilirkişiler mi yapmış farklı bilirkişiler mi yapmış, denetime açık mı, değil mi? Bir de kıymetli üstadım şunu söylüyor. Diyor onlar HTS’ye ilişkinmiş. En azından burada da o bağlamı kurmuş olayım. Yok öyle bir şey. Öyle bir şeyin kurulması mümkün değil, şimdi son böyle cümlemi hafiften toplayacağım. Fazla vaktinizi almayayım. Yani sıktığımı da düşünmüyorum, inşallah sıkmamışımdır. Şimdi sunulan dosyaya sunulan ama sosyal medyada alay konusu haline getirilen bir delil var. Aslında o kadar kıymetli bir delil ki, bunun tarifini de tasnifini de biz kendimiz yaptık. Kıymetli heyetimize sunduk. Diyorlar ya baz raporu doğrultusunda bir hareketlilik var. Bir bölge var bu bölgede bir hareketlilik var diyorlar. Şimdi bu hareketliliğin gerçek anlamda vücut bulabilmesi için bir eforun aslında sarf edilmiş olması lazım. Biz bunu kimde denedik? Salim Güran’da denedik. Dosyanızın sanığı, şimdi tutanak halinde tutulan bir belge, şu an bulamadım, çok özür diliyorum, tutanak halinde tutulan bir belge var. Diyor ki, Salim Güran suç mahallinde ya da suç mahalli saatinde tamı tamına 45 adım atmış. Şimdi diyorlar ki, bunun doğruluğunu ben nereden bileceğim? Bunun doğru olma ihtimali var mı? Yok mu? Şimdi biz bunun denetimini ya da denetiminin yapılmasını biz mahkemeden istedik. İstemedik mi? Dedik ki eğer ki şüpheniz var ise denetleyelim. Şimdi bir teknik var. Jiroskop tekniği.\n\n\nYetersiz Şüphe ve Beraat Talebi ​\nÇok böyle teknik alanlarda kullanılan ve fonksiyonları tamamen tarif eden bir teknik jiroskop. Yani adım attığınız zaman adımı tarif eden bir teknik ve bu uygulamalarda jiroskop tekniği uygulanıyor. Benim işim gücüm yok, bunu araştırmak zorunda mıydım? Hayır ama niye? Bir iddia var. Ben iddiayı çürütmek ile mükellef miyim? Evet. Şimdi kül halinde kül halinde dosyaya baktığımız zaman isnat edilen şey belli. Müvekkilimizin dosyada neden tutulduğu belli. Neden tutuklu olduğu belli. Kül halinde dosyaya baktığınız zaman aslında müvekkilimizin bu dosyada şu an karşı tarafımda katılan olarak dosyaya dahil edilmesi gerekiyorken bir acı ile bir ızdırap ile sanık konumuna getirildi. Biz bunu kabul etmiyoruz. Söyledik. Dolayısıyla kül halinde bir değerlendirme yapıldığı zaman müvekkilimizin isnat edilen suçu, cürümü, suçu işlemediği açıktır. Bu konuda değil kuvvetli suç şüphesi, değil kesin kanı; mahkumiyet kesin kanı ile verilir ya, hani diyor ki flu bir şey kalmayacak, tam açık olacaksın diyor. Diyor ki, sen tam açık olduğu zaman hüküm ver, ceza ver ya da beraat ver diyor. Eğer ki tam açık değilsen, diyor ki ben sana hüküm şartları getirdim. 223 ne diyor bize? Diyor ki, senin verebileceğin kararlar belli. Şüphe mi? E’den ver, işlemediğini mi düşünüyorsun? B’den ver, kastın mı yok? C’den ver. Ama sana diyor ki, burada mahkumiyet çok böyle denetimli bir durumdur. Kesin kanıya varmadığın zaman veremezsin diyor. Sana, dolayısıyla müvekkilimizin dosyada sanık olarak yargılanmasını gerektirecek basit şüphe demeyeyim, yeterli şüphe dahi yok. Bu aşamaya kadar kalmış olduğu tutukluluk süresi bellidir, tutuklandığı aşama bellidir. Kendisi Narin kızımızın naaşının bulunduğu günde gözaltına alındı, daha sonra tutuklandı. Yani kendisi şu vakte kadar, hani diyorlar ya, senin kızın değil bizim kızımız diyorlar. Hadsizliği bırak, bu hadsizliktir, sınır aşmadır. O senin kızın değil. Acısını duyabilirsin, herkes gibi burada bir hak arayabilirsin ama hukuk çerçevesinde hukuk çerçevesinde altını çiziyorum italik, dolayısıyla müvekkilimizin dosyada sanık olarak bulunmasını gerektirecek hiçbir belge, hiçbir eylem, hiçbir beyan sadır değildir. Müvekkilimizin öncelikle öncelikle 223/2-B’den, eğer ki şüpheniz varsa ben şüphelendim diyorsanız ise, ama burada kesin bir kanı hiçbir zaman olamaz; E’den beraat hükmü verilmesini arz ve talep ediyoruz.",

    "text": "Av. Onur Akdağ ​\n\nNevzat’ın Çelişkili İfadeleri ​\nŞimdi hatırlarsanız ilk savunmam Nevzat’ı çok rahatsız etmişti başkanım. Odun gibi duran Nevzat bir anda tepki vermişti. Maalesef rahatsız etmeye de devam edeceğiz. Hukukumuzda ikrarın bölünmezliği ilkesi var. Bir insan ifadelerinden birinde yalan ortaya çıkarsa diğer ifadelerine itibar edilmez, ancak Nevzat bey bambaşka. Herkes bilir ki akla ve mantığa uygun olan şeylerin hukuka da uygun olması gerekir. Hukuka uygun olan şeylerin de akla ve mantığa uygun olması gerekir ki, önümüze delil olarak koyabilelim. Nevzat’ın huzurdaki ile birlikte 6 ifadesi, yani 6 yalan beyanından nasıl akla mantığa hukuka ve vicdana sığdıracağız? Her gelişmede her yeni çıkan delilde ve durumlarda Nevzat ifadesini değiştiriyor. Biz de maalesef buna seyirci kalıyoruz, Nevzat’ın daha kaç ifade değiştirmesini bekliyoruz, biri çıkıp şu adama demeyecek mi yeter artık sus yalanlarından bıktık, şimdi sayın başkan bir kişi nerede kayboluyor ise orada en yakın yerde aranmaya başlanır. Olağan şüphelileri de ilk sırada odur. Burada Nevzat’ın evi patikaya en yakın olandır. 21 Ağustos Narin kayboldu. Salim DNA yüzünden 30 Ağustos gözaltına alındı. Nevzat ise 8 Eylül’de gözaltına alındı. Nevzat ilk anda tespit edilebilseydi yani Salim’den önce bulunabilseydi hiçbir kurgusu olmayacaktı. Nevzat’a çalışma tasarlama ve suçu birinin boynuna bırakma fırsatı verildi. Nevzat iki buçuk hafta sonra gözaltına alındı. O da kendisi itirafçı olduğu için değil, kendisi de teslim olmuş değil, aksine oğlunun evinde yatağında altında bir korkak gibi saklanırken yakalandı. Yakalanmasının sebebi günler sonra jandarmanın olay yerini gören çiftlik kamerasına bakmayı akıl etmiş olmasıdır. Çiftlik kamerasına tam 19 gün sonra bakıldı, DARAN-2’ye 19 gün sonra bakıldı ya dönen kameralar silindi, ihmal zincirleri saymakla bitmez. Çiftlik kamerasını incelediklerinde kırmızı arabanın dereye indiğini fark ettiler ve ancak öyle Nevzat’ı gördüler. Gözaltına aldıklarında Nevzat bize iki ayrı hikaye anlattı, daha sonra bu iki hikaye giderek çoğaldı. Birinde dedi ki, amca Salim arabasının ön koltuğunda, bakın bagajda değil arka koltukta değil, herkes görecek şekilde ön koltukta cesedi taşıyordu.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Ceset Taşıma Hikayelerinin Değişimi ve Olay Zamanlaması ​\nBunu neden böyle söylüyor çünkü soruşturma makamı gizlilik kararı verdiği dosyadan aleni olarak çarşaf çarşaf kendi eliyle DNA raporlarını dahi tüm belgeleri alenen servis ediyordu. Nevzat da 30 Ağustos tarihli Van Kriminal’in raporunda DNA’nın bilgisini nereden bulunduğu bilgisini medyadan alıyor, o yüzden bagaj demiyor o yüzden arka koltuk demiyor, ben arabadan indim, o da indi, arabanın ön koltuğunu göstererek bunu ortadan kaldır yoksa seni ve aileni öldürürüm; yaparsan da sana 200.000 TL veririm dedi. Arabanın bagajında çuval var mı dedi, bagajdan çuval çıkarttık, birlikte çuvala koyduk, dereye götür dedi, hikayesi bu kadar. Bir gün sonra savcılıkta hikayeyi değiştirdi. İşte dedi ki, ben aslında hortumla bahçeyi suluyordum, bana Salim yukarıdan bağırdı bekle geliyorum dedim. Bir yere gitme işim var seninle, sonra yanıma araba ile geldi, beni takip et dedi. Biz beraber mezarlık yoluna gittik, arabamızdan indik, bu kez cesedi oradan çuvala koymadığını Salim’den battaniye sıyırarak teslim aldığını evine götürdüğünü evinde çuvala koyduğunu söyledi, çuvalla dereye götürdüğünü anlatıyor, yani hikayesi bu kadar bu şekilde. Şimdi burada ısrarla gözden kaçırıldı, bu cinayetin ne zaman işlenmiş olabileceğine dair yaklaşık bir zaman bilgisi vardı elimizde. Narin 15:11’de son kez okul kamerasında görüldü. O yol üzerinde zaten öldürüldü. Kızın içinde ölü halde bulunduğu araba ise 15:40’da deredeydi yani arada 29 dakika var. Size Narin’in ölüm dakikasını söyleyeyim mi, bakın ölüm dakikası, Narin 15:13 te Nevzat’ın ellerinde can veriyor, 27 dakikalık bir zaman dilimi kaldı, 5-6 dakika da dereye gidiş süresi en fazla 21 dakika 21 dakika da eğer çocuğun patikaya çıktığını düşünürsek 2 dakika daha çıkaralım en fazla 19 dakikalık zaman diliminden bahsediyoruz, 19 dakika içerisinde karmaşık bir olay örgüsünde çok sayıda fail ile bu cinayetin işlenmesini kim bana akıl ve mantıkla izah edebilir kim! Dolayısıyla sanık sayısının olabildiğince az, olay örgüsünün de mümkün olduğunca basit olması gerekiyor. Yani karmaşık olmaması gerekiyor, ama şimdi ne oldu, burada jandarmanın çok büyük bir kabahati oldu. 19 gün boyunca çocuk bulunamadı.\n\n\nJandarmanın Soruşturma Hataları ve Yanlış Tutuklamalar ​\nBakılması gereken yer bakılmadı, yapılması gerekenler yapılmadı ve Nevzat ilk başta tespit edilemedi. Fail tespit edilemeyince de olur olmaz tutanaklar ihtas edildi. Fail bulamayınca fail üretmeye kalktılar, çok net söylüyorum başkanım Jandarma ilk Ahmet isimli şahsı tutuklasaydı Nevzat ifadesini ona göre kurgulama zamanına da sahipti. Salim’den sonra tam 9 günü vardı, bir de Jandarma komutanının verdiği talihsiz müjdeyi, haberi unutmayalım. O sırada tabi Narin derenin altındaydı, kolluk cinayeti çözemeyince agresifleşti, agresifleşince de hatalar yaptı, hatanın da ötesinde kasıtlı olarak yani ailenin işkence iddiaları yalan yanlış tutanakları, yok bunun bununla ilişkisi varmış da, bunun yengesiyle ilişkisine yönelik istihbari bilgi varmış falan filan işte. Neticede Jandarma kırk yılın başı elinde bir cinayet dosyası geçince bocaladı eline yüzüne bulaştırdı ve hırsına yenildi. Bu iş polislere verilseydi Polis Kriminal’e verilseydi böyle olmazdı. Jandarma her ifadeyle başka hikayenin peşine düştü, kim ne dediyse çocuğun en son görülme saati ona göre değişti, zamanlar değişti, failler değişti, her bir hikayenin peşine koştular, iş çözülemez hale geldi. Günün sonunda kamera kayıtları sayesinde yakalanan Nevzat’ın hikayesi soruşturmanın merkezine alındı. Nevzat ne dediyse ona göre soruşturma yürütüldü. Baz çalışması ona göre yapıldı, halbuki suçu kesinleşen tek bir kişi vardı o da Nevzat. Bu nedenle de Nevzat’ın ifadesi doğrultusunda başta Güran ailesi olmak üzere kim var kim yok kolundan tuttukları gibi içeri attılar. O kadar ki, Salim en az 3 kadınla ilgisi olup olmadığı soruluyor Salim’e. Onlardan ikisi bir tanesi de amcasının karısı, yav utanın be utanın. Bir insan bir köyde kaç kadın ile birlikte olur ve bunların hepsi akrabaları mıdır? Bütün soruşturmayı Jandarma ve Savcılar özel hayat üzerine kurdular. Ya şunu anlarız; dersiniz ki, sizin yengeniz ile mesela 177 görüşmeniz var bunu bize açıklar mısınız? şüphelenmeniz gerekiyor, şüphelenmediniz ama şöyle bir soru olabilir mi Allah aşkına aranızda bir cevapsız çağrı ve siz cevapsız çağrılar ile mi haberleşiyorsunuz? Biz buna ancak gülüyoruz başkanım.\n\n\nSoruşturmanın Yönü ve Somut Kanıt Eksikliği Eleştirisi ​\nOryantalist bir bakış açısı ile soruşturmayı da mümkün olduğunca bel altına kaydırarak adeta ahlaki yargılamalar ile bu soruşturma yürütüldü ve bunun da gerekçesi medyanın ve Nevzat isimli katilin ifadesinin merkeze alınmasıdır. Halbuki soruşturma somut veriler ile ilerlemeliydi. Örneğin, siz bir kadının evde televizyonu olup olmadığını soracağınıza Nevzat’ın evinde arama yapsaydınız ya da siz Narin’in 7 amcası, 3 yengesini gözaltına alırken mesela Nevzat’ın karısını da gözaltına alsaydınız soracağınız soru çok farklıydı. Ya bu adam diyor ki, “Cesedi evime götürdüm”. Kardeşim bak, o esnada evde Nevzat’tan başka kimse var mıydı yok muydu? bu soru bile sorulmadı başkanım, çünkü neden bir hikayenin peşine gittiler. Yav evde Nevzat’ın karısı yok muydu? En azından neden karısını tutuklama gereği duymadınız? O kadar yalan beyanı da var. Kaldı ki, Gazal’ın ifadesi size çelişkili gelmiyor mu? Muhammed bir terlik bulduğu için 3 aydır hücrede yatmıyor mu? Gazal Bahtiyar belki en azından cesedi görenlerden biridir. Bakın en az diyorum. En az cinayeti işleyenlerden biri ya da azmettirenlerden biri de olabilir. Bizim bu konuda çok şüphelerimiz var. Başkanım siz hiç Gazal’dan şüphelenmediniz mi? Adam cesedi eve götürdüm diyor evde arama yapmıyorlar. Adam karısını evden eşya taşımasına Jandarma beraber eşlik ettiler. Yahu cesedin taşınma ihtimali olduğu bir yerden, evden eşya nereden görülmüş! Artık orası suç mahalli değil midir? Fakat Jandarma bu işte faili bulamadıkça kamuoyunun baskı sonucu failleri olabildiğince artırdı ve sonuçta 12 tutuklu oldu. Şimdi soruyorum size başkanım; 12 kişi alındı. Alınsın, helal hoş olsun da, netice nerede günün sonunda bir katili bulabildik mi? Bu kadar soruşturma yapıldı, ifadeler, tutanaklar, o onunla yattı mı, öbürü televizyonunu açtı mı? Bütün soruları sordunuz, peki bu soruyu hiç kendinize sordunuz mu, Narin’i kim öldürdü? Narin neden öldürüldü? Narin nerede öldürüldü? Narin nerede öldürüldü kardeşim nerede öldürüldü? Bu soruların yanıtını bulamadınız, peki bu sorunun yanıtını bulabilmek için gerçek delillerin peşine yeterince koştunuz mu? Ben söylüyorum, hayır. Hayır maalesef.\n\n\nDavadaki Çıkarlar, Medya Algısı ve Nevzat’ın Manipülasyonu ​\nŞimdi maalesef bir çok insanın bu dosyada menfaatleri, çıkarları, emmeleri var, kimisi farklı gündemde kalmak ister, kimisi gündeme oturmak ister, kimisi Narin’in ardından para kazanmak ister, kiminin aileye husumeti vardır elindeki fırsatı değerlendirir, kimisi aile kavramının kendisinden kürtlerden nefret eder ve bunu fırsat olarak görür. Ya bir gazeteci nasıl olur da Nevzat’ı ölümüne savunur, Nevzat’ı eleştirenleri hedefine alır? Ne oldu tarafsız gazeteciliğe, ne oldu güneşe güç mü yetti? Sayın başkan wishful thinking diye bir kavram duydunuz mu? Herhangi bir nesnel kanıt olmadan bir konu hakkında iyimser varsayımda bulunan ve kişinin kendi gönlünden geçen sonuca meyilli düşünmesidir. Toplum bu işten aile çıksın istiyor. Çünkü harıl harıl ona inandırıldılar. Yani herkes bi ata oynadı, benim atım kazansın istiyor. Ya bu iş din değil, iman değil, takım da tutmuyoruz, at yarışı da oynamadık. Narin’in ölümüne ne kadar korkunç söylüyorum ya haksız yere öldürülmesi ile itham edilmek o kadar korkunç değil mi arkadaşlar? Bunu neden anlamak istemiyorlar? Nevzat’a karşı taraftarlık neden? Biz anlayamıyoruz. Nevzat şimdi diyor ki, tek başıma köyün hakkından geldim, hem namuslarına iftira attım, hem kızlarını katlettim, belki de istismar etti. Hem de günahımı boyunlarına bıraktım yani netice olarak ne diyor? Yedim, içtim, hesabı da size kitledim. Ya bütün bir toplum katile alkış tutuyor, 10 duruşma da olsa 10 ayrı kurgu ile karşımızda olacak, belki bizim namusumuza da laf edecek. Aman ha, sakın ha Nevzat demeyin bize, Nevzat’ın boynuna bırakmayın diyerek devlete ve kurumlarına parmak sallayanlar, o parmaklar ne zaman kırılacak? Ne zaman iş bu kadar çığırından çıkarken devlet aklı ve otoritesi nerede diyoruz sadece. Şunu söyleyelim, Nevzat tüm Türkiye’yi parmağında oynattı, oynatmaya da maalesef devam ediyor. Şimdi Nevzat ile Salim arasındaki HTS kayıtlarından biraz bahsetmek istiyorum sayın başkanım. Nevzat’ın ve Salim’in iletişim tespiti bilgilerine göre, Salim Nevzat’ı en son 21 Mayıs 2024 tarihinde arıyor o tarihten sonra Salim bir daha Nevzat’ı aramıyor. Arada sırada Nevzat kendisi arıyor. Aralarında toplam 47 telefon görüşmesi mevcut.\n\n\nSalim ve Nevzat Arasındaki İletişim, Diğer İfade Çelişkileri ve PSA Bulgusu ​\nDaha önce de belirttiğimiz gibi Arif ile Nevzat arasındaki para meselesinden sonra Salim Nevzat ile bir daha iletişim kurmuyor, kendisiyle görüşmüyor, kendisine selam dahi vermiyor. Olay tarihinden geriye doğru gittiğimizde tam 3 ay boyunca Salim Nevzat’ı aramıyor, aramıyor. Bak aramamışım ben seni üç ay boyunca, senin ile konuşmayacağım ya sana selam dahi vermeyeceğim ama biri çocuğu öldürüp suçuma günahıma seni ortak edeceğim öyle mi? Şimdi deniyor ki, madem Nevzat yaptı neden ilk Nevzat demediniz? Nevzat, çocuk kaybolduktan sonra rol yapıyor. Arif’in gözüne baka baka kendisini teselli ediyor. Allah büyüktür bulunur diyor, sigara ikram ediyor, birlikte namaz bile kılıyorlar. Sırtlarını sıvazlıyor, tüm aileyi resmen hipnotize ediyor ve doğal olarak kimse şüphelenmiyor kendisinden ama yine de Arif ve Salim Nevzat olabilir diyor ancak kolluk ifadelere geçirmiyor, dikkate almıyor. Bir durum da Mehmet Bahtiyar 16 Eylül tarihli ifadesinde, Nevzat ile birlikte saat 17:00’ye kadar Çarıklı’da birlikte çalıştıklarını söylüyor. Buna rağmen hala serbest. Eğer bu ifade tutanaklara yanlış geçirilmiş deniyorsa neden aynı durum Güran’lar için düşünülmüyor? Yani Mehmet ifadesi esnasında söylemediği şey ifadesine katılıyorsa buna inanıyoruz ama Güran’lar olunca jandarma töhmet altında bırakmayın diyoruz. Vedat Bahtiyar önce Salim’i arıyor sonra da Nevzat’ı arıyor. Şimdi siz burada Salim’den şüpheleniyorsunuz, ben de Vedat’tan şüpheleniyorum. Peki her iki durumda da Vedat tutuklanmalı değil mi? Sonuçta sıralı arama yapılıyor, buna inanılıyor. Yani her iki durumda da suça ortak olmuş oluyor. Şimdi PSA konusuna geçiyoruz sayın başkan. 12 Eylül tarihli Adli Tıp Raporunda Narin Güran’a ait olduğu bildirilen vajen-1 sürüntü örneğinden külot dış kısım sürüntü örneğinde külot üzerinde tespit edilen lekelerden, mor renkli etek üzerinde tespit edilen lekelerden, yazma üzerinden tespit edilen lekelerden hazırlanan preparatların mikroskobik incelenmesinde sperm hücresi görülmedi, ancak menide ve idrarda bulunan Prostat Spesifik Antijen yani PSA tespit edildi. Raporda her ne kadar PSA tespit edildiyse de bunun kadınlarda da bulunabileceği söyleniyor.\n\n\nCinsel İstismar İddiası ve Nevzat’ın Pedofili Profili ​\nTabi işte çocuk dere yatağında bulunduğu için dereye akan kirli sular, insan dışkısı bulaşmış olabilir deniyor yani bilemiyoruz ihtimal dahilindedir. Ama eğer bir istismar iddiasından bahsedeceksek, fail ilk amca olarak mı ağabey olarak mı yoksa aileye düşman olmuş, babaya kinlenmiş belki de öç alma duygusuyla yanıp tutuşan psikolojisi analiz edildiğinde bir pedofili geçmişi olabilecek olan Nevzat’ı mı göreceğiz? Sizce hangisi yakın ihtimal? Salim ile Enes üzerinde kurgulanan iki senaryo ve görmemesi gereken bir şey deniyorsa bunun neticesi istismar mı olur? Eğer çocuğa karşı bir istismar girişimi ya da bulgusu olduysa bu çok net bir şekilde Nevzat’ı işaret ediyor. Maalesef bir katilin zihin dünyasını bilemeyiz. Hangi saik ile öldürmüş, kendisi itiraf etmeden anlamayız. Biz zaten ilk celsede Nevzat’a boşuna Narin’e hiç dokundun mu tarzında sorular sormadık, ancak mevcut kanıtlar ile şimdilik yetinmek zorundayız. Bakın Nevzat dere yatağına çocuğu götürüyor, çocuğu gömdükten sonra rahatlamışcasına gidip peynir alıyor, çay içiyor, yemek yiyor. Peki şimdi ne düşünüyoruz, Arif’ten utanarak söylüyorum, haya ederek söylüyorum. Bu bize ne düşündürüyor, bir ihtimal bakın bir ihtimal cinsel istismar sonrası rahatlamasını gösteriyor. Bunu göremiyor muyuz? Adli tıp raporunda bir cinsel bulguya rastlanmadığı söyleniyor, yani cinsel bulgu yok demiyor. Nevzat’ın karanlık zihin dünyasını kimse anlayamaz. Hem öç alma hem de dürtülerini tatmin etmek için bu cinayeti işlemiş olabilir. Sonraki hareketleri maalesef bunu gösteriyor. Narin bir cinsel istismara maruz kalmış ise olağan şüpheli direk Nevzat’tır. Direk Pedofili bir hastanın iç dünyasını anlamak için çok ayrıntılı yabancı bir makaleyi tercüme ederek sayın mahkemenize heyetinize sunuyorum. Makalenin bir yerinde şundan bahsediyor. Diyor ki, bir Pedofili prebubertal çocuklara yani genellikle 13 yaş altı çocuklar yönelik fanteziler kuran, onlardan cinsel olarak uyarılan, onlara karşı cinsel dürtüler hisseden bir bireydir. Pedofiller bu cinsel dürtülerden ciddi şekilde rahatsız olurlar, bu dürtüler nedeniyle kişiler arası zorluklar yaşarlar veya bu dürtüleri gerçekleştirirler. Yeni araştırmalar pedofiliye sahip kişilerin genellikle aşağılık duyguları izolasyon veya yalnızlık, düşük özgüven, içsel dizföri ve duygusal olgunlaşmamışlık gibi hisler yaşadıklarını gösteriyor, bu bizde birini canlandırıyor başkanım.\n\n\nSalim’in Aracındaki DNA Bulguları ve Yanlış Algılar ​\nŞimdi DNA konusuna geliyoruz. Narin’e ait pembe tişört, siyah renkli tişört, çocuk battaniyesinden alınan DNA örnekleri ile müvekkilin fiili olarak kullandığı araçtaki DNA örnekleri karşılaştırılmış Van Kriminal’den alınan swap ve lekelerden alınan rapora göre 47 XX 388 plakalı aracın sol ön koltuğunda oturma yerinde eser miktar da karışım halinde Narin’e ait sürüntü DNA bulgusu olduğu söylenmekle araç koltuk kılıfında bulunduğu söylenen karışım halindeki sürüntünün kusmuk mu, tükürük mü, salya mı, ter veya idrar mı yoksa safra sıvısı, ölü sıvısı mı ne tür bir DNA olduğuna ilişkin ek rapor aldırılmasını talep ettik. Bir de bu bulaşan sürüntünün Narin canlı iken mi yoksa ölüm sonrası ölü bedeninden düşüp bulaşıp bulaşmadığı teknik olarak mümkünse Adli Tıp İhtisas Kurulun’dan sorulmasını talep ettik. Zannedersek sayın heyetiniz bulunan bu sürüntünün eser miktarda olduğu için ne tür bir DNA olduğunun tespitini mümkün olamayacağına kanaat getirmiş ki talebimizi reddetti. Şimdi bu dosyada Salim hakkında yapılan en büyük en korkunç algı da DNA konusudur. Herkes çok iyi hatırlar canlı yayında spikerler ağızlarını doldura doldura, gözlerinden timsah gözyaşı akıta akıta amcanın aracında direksiyon kısmında kusmuk bulunmuş, ölü sıvısı bulunmuş, yok efendim Narin’in dışkısı araçta bulunmuş diye hafızalara kazınan haberler yaptılar. Ancak neticede bunun da yalan olduğu ortaya çıkmış oldu. Ya rapor sizin elinizdeydi be. Salim’in aracında sadece Narin’in DNA’sının bulunmuş algısı da tamamen yalan. Bazı kişilerin DNA’larının araçta ki sürüntüler ile uyumlu olup olmadığı hakkında 6 Eylül tarihli Van Kriminal raporuna göre Muhammed Kaya, Devran Güran, Salim Güran, Kurtuluş Güran’ın DNA’ları da Salim’in kullandığı araçtan çıkıyor. Şimdi birde deniyor ki, Narin’in DNA’sı neden şoför koltuğunda çıkıyor? Ben de soruyorum o zaman, madem Salim bu aracı hep kullanıyorsa neden Salim’in DNA’sı sağ ön koltukta sırt ve oturma kısmında çıkıyor da şoför kısmında çıkmıyor?\n\n\nAraçtaki DNA Konumu ve Diğer Delillerin Çelişkisi ​\nNeden Nevzat’ın iddia ettiği battaniye ön sağ koltuk kısmında ise neden Narin’e ait DNA orada bulunmuyor da sol kısımda bulunuyor? Kaldı ki, Arif’in diğer çocuklarının DNA örnekleri karşılaştırmak için alınmamış. Mesela çalışmaya giderken Osman Güran’ı müvekkilimiz bazen ana yola kadar bırakırdı. Ya da Eren, Eren de arabaya biniyordu. Neden bunların DNA karşılaştırılmaları yapılmadı. Yine Salim’in aracında kendi diğer çocuklarının DNA kalıntıları ortaya çıkmamıştır. Salim’in çocuklarından ve eşine ait örnekler karşılaştırma cihetinde Adli Tıpa gönderilmemişse ondan eğer mesela Arif’in çocuklarının Salim’in çocuklarının DNA örnekleri karşılaştırmak için alınsaydı, o çocuklar arabada sürekli oynuyorlardı, o da çıkardı. Yani Sadece Narin değil, diğer çocukların da çıkardı. Amca Salim’in aracında daha önce Narin’in binmiş olup olmadığı hususunda önceki celsede Yüksel’e Arif’e ve birçok tanığa sorduk. Narin’in daha önce o araca bindiğini herkes teyit etti. Ayrıca Narin nişan için 16 Temmuz’da binmiş bu çok net. Şimdi biz amcadan bahsediyoruz. 7 köyün ötesindeki 7 yabancıdan bahsetmiyoruz. Fuat’a ait olan ama son zamanlarda Salim’in kullandığı araç, kapı önündeyken çocukların bir nevi oyun alanı oluyor. Salim’in aracının bazı kapılarının kilitlenmediğine ilişkin raporda dosyada mevcuttur. 9 Ekim tarihli cam raporuna göre de Salim’in kullandığı aracın sağ ön camı da açılmıyor. Bu da Nevzat’ın arabalar yanaştı, cesedi Salim’in sağ camından aldım ifadelerini de yalanlıyor. Şimdi ilginç bir husus da Narin’in cansız bedeninin bulunduğu 8 Eylül’den sonra DNA kalıntılarının yeniden incelenmesi için araç Van’a gönderildi, camları açık şekilde 12 Eylül tarihli Van Kriminal Raporunda sağ arka kapı iç kısmındaki kıl numunelerinden daha önce Narin’in elbisesi ve battaniyelerinden alınan leke numunelerinden DNA profilleri ile uyumlu olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Birden fazla DNA’nın farklı yerlerde çıkması ne anlama geliyor biliyor musunuz? Narin’in canlı iken araç içerisinde ya gezip oynadığını ya farklı zamanlarda araca farklı yerlerden bindiği ya da Narin’e temas eden yakınlarının o araca bindiği anlamına geliyor. Yani Narin canlı iken binmiş. Çok net çok açık bu.\n\n\nDNA Kalıntılarının Kalıcılığı, Nevzat’ın İfade Değişiklikleri ve Sosyal Medya Algısı ​\nBunun yanında parça önündeki sürüntü DNA yıllar sonra dahi tespit edilebiliyor yani sürüntü DNA o araca ne zaman bulaşıyor, olay günü mü, 10 gün önce mi, 5 yıl önce mi? Her ihtimal olabilir. Ayrıca Salim aracını o gün ve sonrasında hiç yıkamıyor. Tozu ile toprağı ile aracı bırakıyor. Nevzat ile Salim’in aracındaki toprak numuneleri de karşılaştırmak amacıyla alınan rapor da dosyada mevcut. Çok önemli bir husus da Nevzat’ın ilk ifadesinde Narin’in cansız bedenini Salim tarafından alt yola geldiği 21 Eylül tarihli ek ifadesinde de cesedi kendisinin battaniye ile aldığı ve fakat daha sonra battaniye almak için Salim’in aracı ile alt yola geldiği mevcut iki baz raporu ile de çürütülmektedir. Çünkü alt yolda bir araç trafiği söz konusu değildir. Nevzat ifade değiştirince oklar Arif’in evine yöneldi. Yukarıda izah ettiğimiz baz raporundaki Nevzat ve Salim’in hareketlerini gözümüze getirdiğimizde Nevzat’ın tüm ifadeleri boşa düşmüyor mu? Zaten bazılarının 4 elle sarıldığı baz raporlarında Salim ile Nevzat’ın baz çakışması alt yolda yoksa Ulusal Kriminal’in tespitlerinden biri olan araçların yanaşması hususu da Ruhi Kaya’nın kamerası ile tarafımızca çürütüldüyse, yani Salim’in Narin’in cansız bedenini aracına koymadığını çok net göstermiyor mu? Bu arada battaniye mevzusu da işte buyurun ilk bu paylaşımla ortaya atıldı. Murat Çınar Çatalca isimli bir fake hesap tarafından Salim Güran köy muhtarıdır. HTS kayıtlarında olay öncesi ve sonrasında Narin Güran’ın annesi ile hem aramalar hem de mesaj kayıtları var. Bir petrole gidiyor marketten ıslak mendil alıyor, yakıtını da almıyor, bu muhtar Narin’in erkek kardeşi Enes ile de görüşüyor. Telefon kayıtlarına göre olay sonrası ve kamera kayıtlarında ne yazık ki Narin ya baygın ya da Salim’in elleri ile boğulmuş vaziyette yatıyor. Ön koltukta ve üstünde koyu kahve renginde bir battaniye vardı. Şimdi çok ilginç detaylar değil mi? Daha ortada bir şey yokken Enes’ten, Salim’den, Yüksel’den battaniyeden boğulmadan bahsediyor. Bu iddialar tam da Salim’in gözaltına alındığı güne denk geliyor. Yani 30 Ağustos. Bakın daha çocuk bulunamamış çocuğun kesin ölüm sebebi de belirlenememiş bu mesajı kim atıyor. En iyi ihtimalle Nevzat demeyelim mi? Nevzat’ın ailesi olmasın?\n\n\nSosyal Medya Mesajının Etkisi ve Uydurma Senaryoların Eleştirisi ​\nBen iddia ediyorum bu mesaj tüm soruşturmanın ruhuna çıktığı, ruhunu esir aldığını iddia ediyorum. Şimdi Nevzat kalkmış her ifadesinde istikrarlı bir şekilde battaniyeden bahsediyor. Peki neden her ifadede yeni bir hikaye ama hikayenin de değişmeyenleri Salim’in çocuğu öldürmüş olduğu ve battaniye mevzusu. Olayların gelişme anına göre sosyal medya ve televizyondan takip ede ede ifadelerini mükemmelleştirmeye çalışıyor. Ben Nevzat’ı çok iyi analiz ettim, çok iyi tanıdım. Nevzat her şeyi bir papağan gibi, bir baykuş gibi televizyondan izleyerek, sosyal medyadan öğrenerek bu hale getirdi. Arabada bulunan DNA ortada bir cinayet yokken bir insanın gözaltına alınmasına ve bir insanın tutuklanmasına sebep oluyor çünkü ortada bir ceset yok ve kişi kasten öldürmeden tutuklanıyor. Ceset olmadığı halde, düşünün bak o zaman bu DNA’nın mahiyetinin çocuğun ölüm halinde salgıladığı bir sıvı olması gerekmez mi? Aksi durumda bir kişinin kasten adam öldürmekten tutuklanması mümkün değildir, ancak Salim direk tutuklandı direk. Şimdi sayın başkan gelelim fatura meselesine. Şimdi iddia edilen senaryolara göz gezdirelim. Öncelikle Salim ile Yüksel’in ilişkisi var, bu ilişki de evin içerisinde gerçekleşiyor. Salim Arif’in evindeki diğer üç çocuğa aldırış etmeden eve gidiyor, tam o esnada Narin geliyor. Evin iki kapısı var. Narin her iki kapısını da olağan üstü bir güç ile açıyor ve durumu görüyor. Salim çocuğu öldürmek zorunda kalıyor. Tabi evdeki diğer üç çocuğu öldürmüyor ama Narin gelince görünce öldüresi geliyor sonra dışarıda hazır bulunan Nevzat’a tepeden sesleniyor. Nevzat eve geliyor, Nevzat’ın boş oda dediği odada Narin’in cesedini görüyor tabi bu arada Nevzat 4 tane çocuk bazasını göremiyor ancak Narin’in ağzından köpük geldiğini görüveriyor. Salim olayı Nevzat’a anlatıyor. Şimdi küçük bir beden sözde görmemesi gereken bir şeyi gördüğü için öldürüldü öyle mi? O zaman neden ben cesedi götürmüyorum da 3 aydır konuşmadığım yetişkin bir yabancıya taşıtıp kendime yeni bir şahit yaratıyorum neden? Bir başka anlatımla 8 yaşındaki bir masum şahit olduğu için öldürülüyor ve fakat 50 yaşında aile dışında yetişkin bir yabancı daha büyük bir suça ortak ediliyor.\n\n\nİkinci Senaryonun Saçmalığı ve Ailenin Rolü ​\nTekrar dönelim, Salim Nevzat’ı Narin’i taşıması konusunda ikna ediyor, tehdit ediyor, kendisine para teklif ediyor, Nevzat korkuyor, siniyor, kabul ediyor. Cesedi alıp götürüyor Yüksel de arkasından öylece ağlayarak bakıyor. Şimdi ikinci senaryoya bakalım Enes görünmemesi gereken biri ile ya da bir hayvan ile bir şey yaparken Narin şahit oluyor, Narin’i oracıkta boğuyor. Bu hikaye absürt sayın başkan. Salim oralarda hazır bekliyor veyahut kendisine dumanla birileri haber uçuruyor. Hemen olaya el koyuyor organizasyona başlıyor. Organizasyonlar Muhtar Salim’den sorulur. Nevzat’ı çağırıyor. Nevzat yine tehdit edilmiş, ikna edilmiş, Nevzat korkmuş, Nevzat sinmiş, Nevzat gariban, işçi, emekçi, köylü vs. Nevzat, Nevzat çocuğu çuvala koyup dere kenarına götürüyor. Ha bu arada 7 Kasım çocuğu ahırın penceresinden 3 metre yukarıdan vahşice atmasını da itiraf etmesini de kızmayalım, öfkelenmeyelim. Bakın ancak burada kimse şunu sormuyor. Senin öz oğlun senin öz kızını öldürecek, ben de inisiyatif alacağım suç ortağı olacağım. Yetmezmiş gibi kendim götüreceğime 3 aydır konuşmadığım bir yabancı ile suçuma günahıma ortak edeceğim. Bu arada Arif’e hiç danışmıyorum, kimse kendisini bu konuda aramıyor. Ya ne kadar saçma. Senin öz oğlun senin öz kızına kıyacak, ben seni haberdar etmeyeceğim, sen bana demez misin ulan bari kızımın bir mezarı olsaydı kızım hayvan mıydı da dere yatağına gömdünüz? Onca çocuklarımın geleceğini unutup Enes için ağırlaştırılmış müebbet hapis cezasını göze alıyorum. Ne için onlarca çocuklarımdan yeğenlerimden birisi için ne için Narin’i öldüren bir yeğen için onca tutuklu kadın, erkek çoluk çocuk ta Enes için kendilerini feda ediyor. İşkenceye rağmen itiraf etmiyorlar. Ne için? Enes için, Salim için. Ya ben babamın günahını söylerim. Kerpeten görsem Nevzat’ı oğlunun aracını o gün koymak için aldığını, köye getirdiğini, aracını köye getirdiğini Salim nereden bilecekti? Bu soru da çok kritik. Kendisine de sormuştuk zaten. Şimdi aranızda Allah aşkına bu tiyatroya son verecek bir akıllı yok mu? Bu senaryoları ben uydurmuyorum. Yanlış anlamayın, bunlar bazı aklı evvel ilkesi şuursuzların uydurdukları konuştukları 7/24 topluma empoze ettikleri şeyler.\n\n\nCinayet Saati İletişim Eksikliği ve Fatura Ödeme Kanıtı ​\nKimse şunu sormuyor, madem Enes öldürmüş Salim neden tam cinayet saatinde Arif’i aramıyor demez mi? Kardeşim ne yapalım ne edelim böyle bir olay olmuş. Şimdi gelelim her iki senaryonun da ortak noktası olan en komik kısmına. Kahramanımız Herkül Salim tüm bunlar başına gelirken mobil bankacılık üzerinden iki tane fatura ödemesi gerçekleştiriyor. 15:19 ve 15:28’de 11 Eylül tarihli. Ön inceleme raporunu dosyada olmasına rağmen biz yine de 15 Aralık ta UYAP üzerinden sayın mahkemeye sunduk. Biz Diyarbakır Barosu’nun bir üyesi olmaktan onur ve şeref duyuyoruz bunu bir kere baştan belirtelim. Bağlı olduğumuz kurum çok güzidedir, eski baro başkanı saygıdeğer Nahit Eren’in savunmalarının çoğunda bizden bahsetmesi, savunmalarına sirayet etmiş olmamız bizi onurlandırdı, gururlandırdı. Ancak sayın Nahit Eren şahsımızı sosyal medyada delilleri tartışmak ile suçladı. Madem sen delil tartışıyorsun ben de tüm savunmalarımı senin üzerine kurarım çabasına girdi. Kendisi bizden yaşça çok büyük, kendisine hürmetimiz sonsuz, ancak Nahit bey şunu unutuyor; bu davayı alevlendiren, çığırından çıkaran, tamamen sosyal medya ve sosyal medyadaki korkunç algılardır. Kolluğun soruşturmada sorduğu bütün sorular neredeyse sosyal medyada atılan iftiralardır. Örneğin benzinlikçi, örneğin direksiyonda kusmuk bulunmuş yalanı, biz hiçbir şeyden korkmadan yılmadan bir şöhret bir ün arzusu gütmeden adımızı koyarak sosyal medyadaki yanlış algıları düzeltmek adına Twitter’a girdik. Biz savunduklarımız ile ortaya koyduğumuz delillerimiz ile en azından vicdan sahibi olan bazı insanlara ya Nevzat da olabilir bak görüyor musun bizi yanıltmışlar dedirtebildik. Ünlü olmak isteseydik bazılarının yaptığı gibi canlı yayınlara çıkardık, yüzümüzü gösterirdik. Herkesin savunduğunu savunmak çok kolay çok. Biz herkese rağmen onca hakaret, tehdit, telkinlere rağmen bu yola girdik. Eğer bu para ile ölçülebilir bir şeyse kusura bakmayın biz yediğimizi, içtiğimizi, aldığımızı unuttuk. Biz Arif’in acısını kendi acımız bilerek tüm gayretimiz ile ortaya bir şeyler koyduk. Nahit savunmalarının yarısından fazlasında bizden ve şahsımızın bulduğu delillerden bahsediyor, bunları çürütmeye gayret ediyor. Tekrar söylüyorum, ben bundan onur duydum, gurur duydum.\n\n\nPedometer (Adımsayar) Kanıtı ve Bilirkişi Güvenilirliği ​\nLakin biz bu aşamadan sonra kendisinden bahsetmeyeceğiz çünkü kendisinin dosyaya maddi hakikatin ortaya çıkması için bir katkısının olduğunu da düşünmüyoruz. Yani bizim Nahit Eren’in savunmaları üzerinden bir beyanda bulunmamız anlamsız. Zira kendisi dosyada ekstra bir maddi delil ortaya koymuş değil. Şimdi diyorlar ki, mobil ödeme ölmüş ise çocukları da yapabilir ya da otomatik ödeme söz konusu olabilir. Ya bunu kanıtlamak çok kolay, çok basit. İlgili bankalara müzekkere yazılsın, sorulsun. Neticesi ne ise biz kabul ediyoruz. Çünkü bankaların giriş çıkış hareketlerini ve eşleşmiş cihazları kaydetme huyları var. Siz bu kadar GPS, baz ile çürütmeye gayret edeceğinize buyurun, hodri meydan diyorum. Eğer çekindiğiniz bir şey yoksa bankaya müzekkere yazılsın. Ben talep ediyorum, ben delillerimin arkasındayım. Şimdi biraz adım sayar konusundan bahsedelim. Sayın başkan, 18 Aralık tarihinde talebimiz üzerine tutulan tutanak ile Salim’in sadece 45 adım attığı kanıtlanmış olup, şimdi herkese içtenlikle şunu soruyorum. Elinizi vicdanınıza koyun. Eğer 45 değil de 145 adım çıksaydı şimdi herkes katil Salim’dir diye ilan etmiş olur muydu, olmaz mıydı? Şimdi herkes Av. Onur Akdağ kendi elleri ile müvekkillerini katil ilan etmiş diye bas bas bağırmaz mıydı? Kimse tartışmaz mıydı hatalı diye? Arkadaşlar, bu bir gayret, inanç ve cesaret mevzusudur. Ben buradaki meslektaşlarımdan tecrübesiz, bilgisiz, yetersiz olabilirim. Hepsi benim başımın tacıdır. Ancak kabul edin ki, çok cesurum. Bir şeye inanıyorsam onun üstüne gidiyorum. Ben müvekkilime inandım, ben bu davaya inandım. Mesela 145 adım çıksaydı, yok efendim adımsayarın hata payı vardır, adım sayar doğru ise önceki saatler sonraki saatler ile yaşandığı iddia edilen olaylar arasında bu kadar çelişkili olmazdı diye bazıları çarpıtıp durmazdı. Salim Diyarbakır da eşi ve kızları ile alışveriş yaparken oğlu Miras ve Yusuf ile kahvede oturuyor. Bunu ifadelerden bilmiyor muyduk bunu neden çarpıtıyorsunuz, yok efendim tarlada 19:00 ile 20:00 arasında neden bugün bu kadar çok adım attı da diğer saatlerde atmadı? Asıl soru bunlar değil arkadaşlar, bakın asıl soru bu uygulamanın hata payı var mı yok mu? Neden bunu bir teste de tabi tutmak için talebiniz yok?\n\n\nAdımsayarın Öneminin Vurgulanması ve Baz Raporuyla Çelişkisi ​\nAdım sayar hakkında bir teknik rapor aldıralım o halde. Şimdi olayı kişiselleştireceğinize bu kadar net bir delil ortadayken ve hepimizin amacı yalnızca maddi hakikatin ortaya çıkması iken neden ehemmiyetsizleştirme çabasındasınız neden? Biz bu davada aynı yerde durmalıyız. Aynı yerde değil miyiz? Ya bakın, bakın Onur bey şu delili bulmuş neden biz göremedik, bakalım gerçekten bizi hakikate ulaştırabilecek mi diye bilimsel bir metot ile teste tabi tutmaya arzulamak yerine neden el birliği ile savcısı ile barosu ile buruşturup atıyorsunuz? Gerçekler bazılarını rahatsız etse de biz onun peşindeyiz onun. Yoksa biz de ifadeler arasındaki çelişkilere değinip savunmamızı yayar, başımızı sallar geçerdik. Baz raporuna göre Salim’in evinden çıkması, Arif’in evine girmesi, müştemilata girmesi, ahırın çevresinde dolaşması için en az bakın en az 400 adım atması gerekiyor. Biz şayet adımsayara bakılmasını istemeseydik, herkes baz raporunu kesin, tartışılmaz üstünde konuşulmaz olarak görüyordu. Baz raporundaki hareketliliği çok çok iyimser bir şekilde değerlendirelim birlikte. Salim 14:55’te kendi evi ile Arif’in evi arasındaki yolda 14:55 ile 15:18 arasında put gibi durduğunu varsayarsak, put gibi dursun çünkü önceki bütün adımlarını olsun ve orada put gibi dursun, 15:20’de evin kapısında, bakın Arif’e en yakın mesafeyi baz aldık 20 adım da Arif’in evinin kapısında. 15:20 ile 15:22 arasında ahıra gidip geliyor. Minimum gidiş gelişi 120 adım. Sonra 15:22’de eve giriş yapıyor. 15:22 ile 15:32 arasında da Arif’in evinin içerisi ve diğer odalarda hareketli bir şekilde bulunmaya devam ediyor. Senaryoya göre evde bir 50 adım daha atar mı? 50 adım diyelim. Salim 15:36 sıralarında tekrar ahırın arka kapısına geçiş yapıyor. Evden çıkışı ile ahırın arkasına girişi 70 adım olsun, git gel 140 adım daha. Çünkü aynı rapor Salim’i tekrar Arif’in evinde gösteriyor. 15:41’de evden ahırın arka kısmına tekrar geçiyor. Bir 60 adım daha. Saat 15:42’de Arif ile kendi evi arasında bulunan yolda olduğu iddia ediliyor. 80 adım daha. 15:43’te yine Arif’in evinin önünde minimum tutarak baştaki gibi 20 adım daha söylüyoruz. Baz raporu Salim’i 15:52’de yine Arif’in evinin içerisinde gösteriyor. 10 adım da öyle olsun.\n\n\nAdımsayarın Doğruluğu, Bilimsel Makaleler ve Senaryoların Çürütülmesi ​\nŞimdi sayın başkan, biz surda çok büyük gedik açtık. Bu adım sayar meselesi konuşulmaya başlandığında herkes şunu söylemeye başladı. Zaten kimse Salim öldürdü demiyor ki. Ama Enes öldürdü, Salim’de organize etti. Şimdi Enes’in avukatı değilim ancak şunu belirteyim, kendisinden özür dileyerek, Salim’i bu işin içerisinde çektiğimizde bu dosya bir yığın halinde bütün günahı ile Nevzat’ın başına çökmüyor mu? Çünkü, diyelim Enes öldürdü, o zaman sormazlar mı Nevzat’ı kim çağırdı? Yani Salim burada organizatör olduysa, Enes öldürdüyse, Salim organize ettiyse ve Nevzat da gömdüyse bu Nevzat’ı kim çağırdı, kim tehdit etti, kim ikna etti? Kalkmış diyorlar ki, adım sayar uygulaması verileri saat saat silinebiliyor. bende hodri meydan diyorum ve bilirkişi marifetiyle adım sayar uygulamasında bir silme işlemi var mı yok mu ya da yapılabiliyor mu yapılamıyor mu mutlaka ona bakılsın. Kaldı ki biz araştırmalarımızı yaptık, Salim’in telefonundaki uygulamada saat saat veri silmek mümkün değil. Telefondaki uygulama MiHealth.apk’dır. Bu uygulamada sadece belirli bir tarihe ait veri silebiliyorsunuz. Saatlik veri silme mümkün değil. Şimdi bu adım sayar uygulamasının hata payı var mı yok mu biraz ona bakalım. Buna ilişkin çok kapsamlı harika makaleler elde ettik, çalışmalar elde ettik. Bunlar bilimsel makaleler. 103 kişi 3 hafta boyunca her biri 1 hafta süreyle 3 farklı adım sayar denemesiyle her iki cihazı da aynı anda kullandı, çalışma uygulamanın ortalama günlük 8500 adım sayısını yaklaşık 500 adım fazla tahmin ettiğini gösteriyor. O da %6 daha fazla adım ölçüyor demek ki buna ilişkin makalelerin tamamına baktığımızda en fazla, en fazla %7 hata payı veriyor. O da eksik değil ha fazla. Buna ilişkin makaleleri mahkemeye sunuyorum. Sabrınız için teşekkürler efendim.\n\n\nAdımsayarın Hukuki Delil Değeri: Vander Heyden Örneği ​\nŞimdi size adım sayar ile ilgili çok yönlü bir dava anlatacağım. Wisconsin’li anne Vander Heyden’in hikayesi bu. Özet şu, Heyden erkek arkadaşı ile yaşıyor ve ufak çocukları var. Bir bara gidiyorlar, tartışıyorlar. Adam eve geri dönüyor ve kadın barda kalıyor. Ertesi gün kadın arazide öldürülmüş olarak bulunuyor. Erkek arkadaşı zanlı konumunda. Bir de araba tekerliğinde kadının saç teli bulunduğu için adam mahkûm ediliyor. Sonra adamın arkadaşları araştırma yapıyor. Kadın erkek arkadaşı gittikten sonra onun kızgınlığı ile barda bir adam ile tanışmış ve kanal kenarına getirmiş adamı. Önce bu adam suçlamaları kabul etmiyor. Kadının arkadaşları, tartışmalarını ve kadını öldürdüğünü söylüyor. Sonra bu zaman diliminde anlaşılıyor ki, kadının erkek arkadaşı sadece 12 adım atmış. Yani erkek arkadaşı belirttiği gibi evde olduğu anlaşılmış ve uyuduğu anlaşılmış. Buna ilişkin kararı ve adımsayarın hukuken neden delil değeri taşıdığını çok güzel bir yabancı kararı sayın mahkemeye sunuyoruz.\n\n\nSalim’in Adımsayar Verileri ve Kritik Zaman Dilimi ​\nEvet, Salim Güran toplam 11206 adım atmış, 6 kilometre yürümüş 471 kalori harcamış. Bu aktivite 2 saat 21 dakikada olmuş. Şimdi herkes şuna takılmış; 24 saatlik bir sürede 2 saat 21 dakika mı yürümüş diye. 2 saat 21 dakika her adım atınca işleyen bir süredir. Mesela uyurken, dinlenirken aktif olmuyor, aynı uygulamaya ilişkin bazı örnekleri göstermek istiyoruz başkanım. Atılan adımlar ile harcanan sürenin ne kadar orantılı olduğunu göstermek gerek. Şimdi başkanım yani uygulama benim telefonumda da var. Hiç farkı yok. Tam da Salim’in attığı adıma benzer rakam 11624. 2 saat 13 dakika adım atmışım. Giderek düşürüyoruz. 11624, 2 saat 13 dakika, 9589 adım 1 saat 53 dakika da atmış, 8679 adım 1 saat 37 dakika atılmış. Bakın, oranı görüyor musunuz? Ne kadar düzenli orantısal bir azalış. Yine 7226 adım atmışız 1 saat 28 dakika. Şimdi biz de merak ettik; 21 Ağustos tarihinde biz kaç adım atmışız? Toplam 7185 adım atmışız. 1 saat 20 dakika da tam kritik zaman olan 15:00 ile 16:00 arasında 26 adım atmışız. demek ki biz de katil değiliz başkanım, biz de katil değiliz.\n\n\nSalim ve Nevzat’ın İnternet Kullanım Karşılaştırması ​\nNevzat ile Salim’in internet kullanım geçmişinden bahsediyorum şu an. Salim ile Nevzat’ın BTK’dan gönderilen dökümanlarda internet kullanım veri geçmişine baktık. Hareketlerin karşılaştırmasını inceledik. Salim Güran tam kritik dakikalarda yani 15:10 ile 15:40 arasında yer yer yoğun bir şekilde internete giriyor, veri indiriyor. Hatta 15:28’deki yoğunluk kendisinin mobil bankacılık üzerinden ödeme yaptığının bir göstergesidir. Salim’in bu dakikalardaki internet dökümü tam 16 sayfa. Nevzat’ın ise sadece 3 sayfa. Aynı dakikalar arasında Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın internet hareketliliğinde neredeyse hiçbir şey yok. Telefonunda arka planında çalışmasından dolayı sınırlı veri indirimi söz konusu. Yani internete girmiyor. Neden mi? Çünkü eli dolu adamın eli. Çünkü cinayet işlemekle meşgul maalesef. Çünkü Narin’i bulup dere yatağına götürmekle meşgul kendisi. Bu arada sakın demeyin Nevzat fakirdir, internet paketi azdır falan. Dün sorduk, ilerleyen saatlerde Nevzat internet kullanımında rekorlar kırıyor rekorlar. Şimdi dün Salim’in 15:10 ile 15:40 arasındaki internet kullanımının diğer saatlere göre internet kullanımından yok denecek kadar az olduğu şeklinde algı yapıldı. Ancak gerçek bambaşka. Biz bu maddi hakikati ortaya koyarken sadece Salim’in internet veri geçmişinden bahsetmiyoruz ki. Nevzat ile Salim’in veri kullanımının karşılaştırılması da bir anlam ifade ediyor. Dün sadece Salim’in internet kullanımından bahsedilerek resmen algı yapıldı. Salim ile Nevzat’ın kısaca İnternet’ini değerlendirelim. Öncelikle Salim’e bakıyoruz. 15:14’ten 15:25’e kadar internette yoğun bir şekilde kullanım mevcut. Özellikte 15:25:08’de Salim rekor internet harcaması yapıyor. 15:26 yine ciddi internet kullanımı, 15:27:43 te ise aşırı yoğun kullanım mevcut. 15:28:54’ten 15:33:43’e kadar yine ciddi bir internet kullanımı var. 15:33:53 yoğun veri akışı devam ediyor. 15:36 ve 15:41 Salim’in internete yoğun girdiği dakikalar. Nevzat’a bakacak olursak 15:10:24 saniyede internette. Bu saniyeden sonra interneti 15:15:30’a kadar ölüye eşdeğer ölüye. Arka plandaki uygulamaları bile susmuş. 15:15 ile 15:20 veri akışları oluyor, ancak kayda değer akışlar değil. Arka plan uygulamalarının kullandığı veriye benziyor. 15:26:09 saniyede 09 kadar bir ölü gibi yine. O dakikalardan 16:01’e kadar interneti resmen uykuda. 16:01’de bir internet yoğunluğu olup yeniden kapanıyor. Şimdi Nevzat net ve yoğun olarak 17:06 ile 17:49 arasında uçak hızında internet kullanıyor. Yani 17:06’dan 17:49’a kadar uçak hızında internet kullanıyor. İnternet verilerinin o ana ait sayın mahkemeye yine sunacağız. Şimdi de biraz Google haritalar mevzusuna bakalım başkanım. Cinayet gününde ve saatinde Salim’in raporunda iddia edilen hareketlerinin olup olmadığı, Nevzat’ın tepeye çıkıp çıkmadığı ve Salim ile Nevzat’ın tam da cinayet saatinde bir kesişiminin olup olmadığının tespiti amacıyla müvekkilim Salim Güran ve diğer Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın telefonundan Google haritalar uygulamasından zaman çizelgesinin incelenmesini talep ettik. Ancak kabul görmedi. O zaman telefonun konum özelliği açıksa cihaz içerisindeki sistem dosyalarımdan GPS verileri depolanabiliyor. Salim’in konumu her zaman açık her zaman. Telefonların bu amaçla teknik bilirkişiye gönderilmesini talep ediyoruz. Adli bilirkişi uzmanları özel yazılımlar ile bu verileri telefonun hafızasında kurtarabilir. Biz her türlü delili istiyoruz. Ya şimdi bir örnek göstereyim Google zaman çizelgesinden sayın başkan. Biz bu şekilde göreceğiz Nevzat’ı Salim’i bu şekilde göreceğiz. Eğer görürsek, şimdi Ulusal Kriminal’e değinmesek olmaz. Ulusal Kriminal’in raporunun tam bir fiyasko olduğunu söylemek gerek. Sayın mahkemeniz Ulusal Kriminal’den 4 talepte bulundu. Bu taleplerden 3 tanesi raporda yer buldu, ancak Nevzat’ın ilk ifadesinde ve son ifadesindeki belirttiği alt yoldaki araç hareketliliği olduğu tespiti yapılmış ise de, arkadaşlar bunun da gerçeklikten uzak olduğunu düşünerek Ruhi Kaya’nın kamerasından görüyor ve mavi traktör, beyaz fluance meselesini ortaya çıkarıyorlar, sağ olsunlar. Ulusal Kriminal Narin’in kıyafet unsuru ile patikaya çıktığını ve bunun takip edilebildiğini söylüyor. Peki Narin’i tespit ettiğini iddia eden bilirkişiler, neden Nevzat’ın tepeye çıktığını veyahut Salim’in tepeden seslendiğini tespit edemiyor? Bu durumda cüssece Narin’in iki katı olan Nevzat’ı nasıl tespit edemiyor? Ya doğru sende haklısın zira Nevzat Narin’in kocaman yüreğinin tırnağı bile etmiyor, tırnağı bile o yüzden göremiyorsun. Ulusal Kriminal’e göre Narin yaklaşık 50 saniye içerisinde patikayı çıkıyor. Ben iddia ediyorum, bir yetişkin bile, depar atsa bile 2 dakika da çıkar o yolu, o yokuşu. O yüzden bu yöndeki tespitleri de tamamen asılsız. Bu arada Ulusal Kriminal sanki bir şey başarmış gibi kendi PR çalışmasını yapması yetmiyor gibi bir de başkanı kalkmış patates hatlar ile Güran ailesinin kendisini tehdit ettiğini iddia ediyor. Ya senin tarafsızlığın nerede be? Buyurun o paylaşım kendi hesabından paylaşıyor beyefendi.\n\n\nSIM Kartlar, Uluslararası Kuruluşlar ve Kırmızı Araç Meselesi ​\nHemen söyleyeyim başkanım, jandarmayı yanlış yere yönlendirmek için alınan 40-50 SIM kartı şimdi görevli olan Ulusal’ı kapalı tehditte mi kullanılıyor acaba gülücük, evet başkanım.\nŞimdi biz kendi imkanlarımız ile Ulusal ve Uluslararası Kuruluşlara da görüntüleri gönderdik. Bu bakımdan da sizden süre talep ediyoruz başkanım. Şimdi biraz da kırmızı renkli çingene araç meselesine değinelim. Mütalaada iki çingene ile çingene kırmızı aracın görüldüğü yönünde Salim’in ses kaydından bahsediliyor. Savcılık makamı muhtarın bu sözüyle aramaların Suriyelilere yönlendirildiğini iddia ediyor. Ek olarak da kırmızı araç ile Nevzat’ın aracından kastedilerek şüphelerin Nevzat’a çekilmesi arzulanıyor, arzulandığı yönünde beyan ediliyor. Şimdi dilerseniz birlikte ses kaydını dinleyelim. Bakın bu ses kaydı ile net olarak görülüyor. Salim köy halkından ne duyuyorsa onu anlatıyor. Bir nevi yansıtıcı görevinde Salim. Hatta yanındakine soruyor çünkü ondan duymuş, ondan öğrenmiş. Sesi dinleyelim başkanım.\n\n\nÇarıklı Aramaları ve Salim’in Kaybolma Saati İfadeleri ​\nBir de Çarıklı’da aranan bazı evlerin Nevzat’ın bazen ara sıra kaldığı evler olduğu söylense de bu yönde bir kanıt da dosyada mevcut değil. Zaten müvekkilim de biraz önce açıkladı. Aranan evlerin hiçbirinin yakından uzaktan ilgisi yok. Yine bazı ses kayıtlarında Salim çocuğunun kaybolduğu saati ilk başta 15:30 olduğunu söylüyor. Biraz önce dinledik. Sonra da giderek bu saati ilerletip en son 17:00 civarında söylüyor. Burada da aynı şekilde Salim ne duyuyorsa onu söylüyor onu. Tarladan köye gelince köylülerin beyanlarına göre ilk 15:00 ile 15:30 olduğunu, bir jandarma personelini arayarak soruyor. Köyde her kafadan bir ses çıkıyor, kim çocuğu ne zaman görmüş ise Salim’e aktarıyor. En basitinden, madem Salim Birsen’i 17:40’a telkin ettiyse, o zaman Salim neden ilk başta daha ilk gün Şakir Başçavuş’a 15:00 ile 15:30 arasında çocuğun kaybolduğunu söylüyor? Ben hem Birsen’i tehdit edeceğim, hem de gerçek saati ilk baştan kameralar incelenirse jandarmaya kendim söyleyeceğim? Ne kadar saçma! Son olarak başkanım, bir iki hususa da değineceğim. Bir 15-20 dakikalık süremiz var. Baz raporuna gelecek olursak;\n\n\nDaraltılmış Baz Raporunun Geçersizliği ve Ses Kayıtlarıyla Çelişkisi ​\nDaraltılmış baza ilişkin olarak bilimsel ve teknik açıdan nokta atış yapılamayacağı, içi içe olan evler ve oda oda nokta nokta gösterilmesinin yalnızca bir fanteziden ibaret olduğunu geçen celse izah ettik. Salim’in, Narin’in cesedini kontrol amacıyla o gece kendi aracıyla Eğertutmaz deresine gittiği mütalaada yer bulmaktadır. Aracın markası, rengi ve modeli kamerada tespit edilememiş; yine daraltılmış baz kaydı ile kesin olarak orada olduğu tespit edilmiş. Çiftlik kameralarındaki görüntüleri hepimiz izledik. Salim’in içinde olduğu iddia edilen araç ilk defa 22:33’te kamerada görülüyor. 22:48 ile 22:55’e kadar kontağı hiç kapatmadan bekliyor. 22:56’da da geldiği istikâmette görüntüden kayboluyor. Çok şükür ki, Salim’in kendi telefonunda ses kaydedicisi mevcutmuş. Allah’a çok şükür o gece 22:41’de Hacı Kaya ile 23 saniyelik bir telefon görüşmesi yapıyor. Tam o dakikalarda çiftlik kamerasında gördüğümüz araç ağacın arkasında anlamsız manevralar yapıyor. Yani araç durmuyor kimse de içinden inmiyor. Ancak ses kaydını dinlediğimizde Salim’in yürüdüğünü ve yanında insanların olduğunu duyuyoruz. Köyde çeşme tarafında olduğunu tahmin ediyoruz. Salim Kürtçe konuşuyor. 300 kişi ile arama yaptıklarını ve fakat çocuğu bulamadıklarını anlatıyor. Yine 22:32’de, bu da çok önemli, Kurtuluş Güran, 23:01’de de Arif Güran ile ses kaydı var, bunlarda da köy çevresinde olduğu çok net olarak belli oluyor başkanım net. Buyurun şimdi o ses kayıtlarını dinleyelim. Önce 22:41’i dinliyoruz başkanım. Yani ağacın arkasında anlamsız manevralar yapıyor, Narin’in bulunduğu yerde olduğu iddia ediliyor. Arkadaki seslerde çağıranlar, yürüyüş sesleri ve Salim’in yürüdüğü anlaşılıyor. Eğer buradan anlamıyorsak bir de 22:32’ye bakalım başkanım. Yani 22:32’nin anlamı ne? Kamerada görünebilmesi için sadece 1 dakikası var.\n\n\nSes Kayıtlarının Kanıt Niteliği ve Nevzat’ın Yer Gösterme Tutarsızlığı ​\nBakın başkanım biz bu delili uydurmadık. Biz delili dosya içerisinden aldık. Bize birileri de yardım etmedi. Biz sadece dosya içerinde gördüğümüzü söylüyoruz, gösteriyoruz. Yani şimdi burada 22:32’de yürüdüğünü hepimiz duyamıyor muyuz? O zaman eğer ben Eğertutmaz deresinde oluyorsam köyün içerisindeki beni nasıl Eğertutmaz deresine atıyor? Bir de 23:03’te de Servet Dinç ile görüşmeleri mevcut. Bu görüşmelerde de bir araç sesi gelmiyor arkadan. İnsan kalabalık sesleri geliyor ve köyün içerisindeyken konuşmalar gerçekleşiyor. Özellikle 22:41’de ki ses kaydı ve 22:32 deki ses kaydı Salim’in köyde olduğunu bize net olarak gösteriyor. Biz bu söz konusu ses kaydının iyileştirilmesinin yapılmasını talep ettik ve talebimizi de yineliyoruz. Şimdi Nevzat’ın minik kızımızı nasıl soğukkanlıkla dere yatağına ilişkin yer göstermesini tüm Türkiye izledik. Yer göstermesinde Nevzat aracın bırakıldığı söylendiği stabilize yoldan dere yatağına tam 5 dakikanın üzerinde ulaştı. 5 dakika git, en az 5 dakika da iddia edildiği gibi çocuğun üzerine iki taş koy ki öyle iddia ediliyor, 5 dakikada geri dön bu iş için en az 15 dakika gerekiyor. Gecenin karanlığında köydeki o kadar jandarma personeline rağmen Salim’in gittiğini düşünürsek, sanki kendisi gömmüşte nokta olarak yeri biliyormuş gibi kabul etsek de mantıken zamanlar da tutuşmuyor. Eğer sesten ikna olmadıysak da zamanlar da tutuşmuyor. Bakın cesedi ilk kez bulan jandarma personeli Cazim Burak Gör cesedin bulunduğu yeri nasıl tarif ediyor. “Üç ayrı taş ile bastırılmış şekilde ve etrafı çalılar ile kaplanmış” ve bunu gece gidip bulabiliyorum hayret bir şey! Sözün kısası kamera kaydı, baz raporları ve ses kayıtları karşılaştırıldığında müvekkil Salim mütalaada belirtildiğinin aksine olay günü gece vakti kesinlikle Narin’in bulunduğu yere gitmiyor, gitmiyor. 3 Aralık tarihli baz raporuna göre köy içerisinde baz raporu çalışması yapıldığında en az 22 bazdan sinyal aldığı ve bu yüzden tespitlerin şüpheye vermeyecek derece de kesin olduğuna iddia ediliyor. Şimdi biz soruyoruz. Peki o halde köyün içerisinde olan bir insanın bazlarını köyün 2-3 kilometre dışına nasıl çıkıyor?\n\n\nBaz Raporunun Çelişkileri ve Bilirkişilerin Tarafsızlığı ​\nYani madem sen en az 22 bazdan sinyal aldığını iddia ediyorsun, Salim’in 22:48 ile 22:55 arasında bazı nasıl köyün dışına atıyor? Aynı rapor müvekkil ile birlikte diğer sanıkları Arif’in evinde oda oda nokta nokta tespit etmiş ve fakat müvekkili 22:47’de mısır tarlası civarında olarak konumlandırılmış. Tam koordinat niye vermiyorsun? Eğer bilirkişiler koordinatı dosya içerisinde görememiş ise biz kendilerine söyleyelim. 9 Eylül tarihli tutanakta zaten yazılı. Şimdi ilginç bir şekilde 3 Aralık tarihli raporun sonuç kısmında “Narin Güran cinayeti ile ilgili olarak dosyada bulunan HTS kayıtları ve Salim Güran’ın ilk ifadesi dışında herhangi bir delile temas edilmemiş, ifadelerden örnek alınmamış ya da kamera kayıtları ile ilgili tutanak rapor alınmamış olup sadece sahada yapmış olduğumuz çalışmalar sonucunda elde edilen veriler raporlanmıştır” şeklinde şerh düşmüştür. Neden buna ihtiyaç duydun? Yani kim sana sordu bunu? Kendinden bir şüphen mi var ki bunu belirtmek zorundasın? 13 Eylül de Salim’in ilk ifadesi alındığında odada yaklaşık 12-13 kişiydik. Bilirkişilerden birisi savcının odasındaydı, ifadenin sonuna kadarda oradaydı, müvekkile ve bize dik dik bakıyordu. Maalesef bizde taşlar yeni yerine oturdu. Aklımıza karpuz kabuğu düşürdüler. Sayın başkan, biz bu saatten sonra bilirkişi olarak atanan kişilerin tarafsızlığına inanmıyoruz. En azından sizi güldürdüm başkanım bir üniversiteden bilirkişi aldırılmasını talep ediyoruz. Tavşantepe’nin tepede olması dolayısıyla en az 22 bazdan sinyal alındığı iddia ediliyor. Bakın bu harita da Tavşantepe ve çevresindeki bazları gösteriyor. Bütün bazlar burada toplanmış. Tavşantepe de şurada en yakın baz 3.7 km uzaklıkta Çarıklı tarafındadır. Yani belirttiğimiz bu çelişkiler söz konusu raporun işi ehil olmayan kişiler tarafından hatalı, taraflı dosyadaki bilgi ve belgeler incelenerek özellikle iddia ediyorum, Nevzat’ın ifadeleri ışığında baz raporu bir senaryo hazırlamış, bu çok net çok açık. Ancak bir teknik takip olursa baz çakışması sonuç verir. Ortada bir teknik takipte yok. Üçgenleme denilen metot ile anlık yapılan teknik takip olursa daraltılmış baz çalışması mümkün olabilir.\n\n\nBilirkişi Kalifikasyonları ve Baz Raporu İddialarının Çürütülmesi ​\nSöz konusu bilirkişilerin hangi alanda uzmanlıkları var, 16 bölge bilirkişi kurulu var ve bu kişilerin bilirkişi listesinde ismi yok. Raporu hazırlayanların kalifikasyonları, uzmanlık alanları nedir, biz bunların hiçbirini bilmiyoruz hiçbirini. Gerçekten bunlar kim, hakikaten kim? İlk duruşmada da çok net söyledik; kök raporda Salim’in 18:38 ile 18:59 arasında Arif’in ikâmeti civarında bulunduğu, 18:57 gibi hareketlenerek Uzunbahçe tarafında bulunan mısır tarlasında bölgede olduğu hareket ettiği söyleniyor. Ancak müvekkil 18:55’gibi okul kamerasının önünden geçiyor. Yani bu ne demek oluyor? Oda oda şaşmaz, yanılmaz üzerinde tartışılması bile abes olan raporda bir gedik açılıyor gedik. Dikiş tutmaz bir gedik! Eğertutmaz deresi mevzusu gibi sen yine müvekkilimi tutup köy dışına atıyorsun. Şimdi raporda öyle bir tablo çiziliyor ki nerede Türkiye’nin kapsama alanı en geniş yerin Tavşantepe olarak gösteriyor, iddia ediyor. İşte bizim ısrarla mahkeme heyetinin katılımı ile keşif icrasının raporu hazırlanması gerektiğini söylememiz bundandır. Zira uzman olmaya da gerek yok. Köyde interneti bırakın telefon bile çekmiyor, çekmiyor. Konum bilgileri en az 200-300 metre şaşma ile gözüküyor. Bu arada şunu da sormak gerekiyor. Baz raporlarına göre Nevzat Bahtiyar, 15:10’da Arif ile Salim’in evinin arasındaki parkede. Peki bu dakikalarda parke yolunda olmak için evden en az kaçta çıkmak gerekiyor? En az 15:07’de o zaman Gazal Bahtiyar’ın 18 Eylül’deki ifadesine ne diyeceğiz? Çünkü Nevzat Salim’i sular kesik bahanesi ile arıyor ve o görüşme 42 saniye sürüyor. Yani bu ne demek oluyor? Gazal Bahtiyar’ın ifadesine bir bakalım. Nevzat telefon ile Salim ile konuştuktan sonra evden çıktı. Bana ağaçları sulayacağını söyledi. Ancak ben kendisinin ağaç suladığını görmedim. Ancak Nevzat’ın araba ile ayrıldığını gördüm. Çünkü ben de kendisiyle dışarı çıktım ve balkonda durdum. Arabasının aşağı doğru gittiğini balkondan gördüm. Aracının yönü istikâmeti köyün çıkışındaki mezarlık istikâmetiydi. Şimdi sonuç olarak Gazal’ın ifadesine göre 15:08’de konuşma bitene kadar, baz raporu da öyle diyor, Nevzat evdeydi. Biz de diyoruz ki, neden bu dakikalar net bir şekilde irdelenmiyor?\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar’ın İfadesi ve Çifte Standart Eleştirisi ​\n15:08:09’da Salim ile görüşürken evinde, 42 saniyelik görüşme esnasında da evinde telefon konuşması biter bitmez 15:09 da evinden çıkarsa uçarak ancak 15:10 da üst yolda parkede. O yüzden keşif önemli. O yüzden, şimdi şu mu iddia mı ediliyor ya da ona mı inanılıyor; bu görüşme ile mi Salim Nevzat’ı çağırıyor? O zaman Narin patikaya çıkmamış. Bir an diyelim ki, baz doğru. Peki o halde Gazal Bahtiyar neden tutuklanmıyor çünkü Gazal yalan söylüyor. Yalan ifadeler veriyor, ya Bahtiyar’lara uygulanan bu korumacı içgüdü bu çifte standart nedir? Sayın savcımız, mütalaasında 4 Eylül tarihindeki kamera görüntülerinden dolayı Ahmet Akgün’e karşı kasten yaralama, tehdit, suçluyu kayırma, suç delillerini yok etme ve gizleme suçundan suç duyurusunda bulunmuş. Bulunmayı biliyor sayın savcımız, hele ki Ahmet Akgün kalkıp canlı yayında her şeyi açıkça samimiyetle söylemişken. O zaman neden Gazal bahtiyar hakkında bir acaba demiyorsunuz ya! Ahmet Akgün’den dolayı yani şimdi Gazal Bahtiyar doğru söylüyorsa baz raporu çöp, eğer baz doğruysa Gazal hakkında şu an ihbarda bulunuyorum, lütfen bir zahmet tutuklansın. Baz raporunda şu an bir zahmet tutuklansın. Baz raporunda Nevzat’ın çocuğu ahıra getirdiğine ilişkin bir veri de mevcut değil. Baz raporu Nevzat’ın ifadelerini de yalanlıyor. Bambaşka bir senaryo çiziyor bize. Hani Nevzat çocuğu ahıra götürmüştü çuvala koymuştu? Ek baz raporunda 2 metre veya 1 dakika sapmadan bahsediyor. 1 dakikada ben 70 adım atıyorum, o da yaklaşık 50-55 metre. Evet ek rapordan itiraf gelmişte haberi mi yok? Daraltılmış baz analizinde en az 50 metrelik sapma olacağından bahsediyor ya. Evler zaten iç içe ve biz hala delili tartışıyoruz hala. Sayın başkan, dar alan baz çalışması ile ilgili olarak yabancı dilde yazılmış ve çeviresine ulaştığımız 4 adet yol gösterici teknik makaleyi dosyaya sunuyoruz. Hepsini okumakla vakit harcamayın diye sarı ile işaretlediğimiz yeri sarı ile işaretliyoruz. Hücresel veri baz analizi ile ilgili yerlerde özellikle bilimsel olarak neden net bir konum analizi yapılamayacağı teknik açıdan anlatıyor ve ekinde de tabloda en iyi koşullarda verebileceği en dar alan metresini söylüyor. O da 100 metre. Çok işlek bir şehirde bir çok baz istasyonu var ise telekomünikasyonculardan kaynaklanan sorunlar yoksa vs. az;\n\n\nDaraltılmış Baz Analizinin Güvenilmezliği ve Tahliye Talebi ​\nSağ olun teşekkürler başkanım, şimdi WiFi teknolojisi ile 50 ile 75 metre arasında sapma payı var, bluetooth teknolojisi ile 10 metre en az sapma payı var. Tüm bunlar Uzman bir Adli Bilişim şirketi tarafından yazılmış makaleler. Danimarka’dan, Amerika’dan hatalı baz çalışmasına göre mahkûmiyet kararı verip sonra düzeltilen yargı kararlarından da bahsediliyor. Yine makalelerde deniyor ki, HTS daraltılmış baz ile ilgili bazdan konum bilgisinin yorumlanabilmesi için öyle yazım falan yetmez, ciddi uzmanlık bilgisi gerekiyor. Ayrıca öncesinde özel bir adli radyo anketi dedikleri bir haritalandırılma metodu gerekiyor. Bazların olduğu bölgeye gidip yapılması gereken sürüş testi dedikleri kontrol işlemleri gerekiyor. Yani bu da sizde, mesela denemek için oraya gidiyorsunuz, telefonunuzla konuşuyorsunuz, bir kaç saat vakit geçiriyorsunuz diyelim, sonra sizin daraltılmış baz analizi bakalım aynı konumda verecek mi? 2019’da Danimarka’da 10 bin yargı kararı yanlış daraltılmış baza dayandığı için iptal edilmiş. Yani asla ve asla güvenilmeyecek bir metottur. Hele de bu kadar dar alanda iç içe olan evlerde bakıyorsak. Evet şimdi herkes dilinin ucu ile konuşuyor. Lütfen ağzımızdaki baklayı çıkaralım. Daraltılmış baz ile Ulusal Kriminal raporu bize ne söylüyor? Artık herkes katilini söylesin kör dövüşü yapmayalım. Ya katil Salim mi yoksa Enes mi? Biz katil Nevzat derken boşuna söylemiyoruz ki. Bir çok delil çıkardık sunduk ama bize ne söyleniyor? Nevzat hariç herkes katil olabilir. Mütalaada da katilin kim olduğu, çocuğun nerede öldürüldüğü söylenmiyor. Salim ile Yüksel’in yasak aşk iftirası okları Salim’e çekti. Yok prenses köpek, yok ensest ilişki deyip deyip okları Enes’e çekiyorlardı. Baz raporuna önem atfedecek isek, baz raporunu bir an olsun kabul edeceksek, o zaman baz raporu Salim’in 15:22’de Arif’in evinin içinde olduğunu söylüyor. Peki öyleyse ne anlama geliyor? Birincisi Nevzat su meselesi yüzünden Salim’i ararken evde değildi çünkü 15:10’da Arif’in evi ile Salim’in evinin parke yolundaydı. Yani Salim kendisini patikadan tepeden seslenmiyor. Nevzat ilahi ile bir işaret ile patikaya çıkıyor. O zamanda hala çocuk patikaya bile yönelmemiş patikaya. İkincisi de Salim, çocuk eve geldikten sonra eve geliyor. Salim’in eve gelişi 15:22’de oluyor. Yani ben raporun ağzındaki baklayı çıkarayım size; Yüksel ile Salim iftirası rapora göre çürütülmüş oldu. Yüksel hanıma müjdeler olsun. Arif’in evinin iki kapısı var, dış demir beyaz kapı demir tellen dışarıdan zor açılıyor, hatta o gün Hediye eve gelince kapıyı Eren kendisi açıyor. Bir de iç kahverengi kapısı var. Evde iki kapı var. 3 tane de çocuk var. Şimdi ben Enes’e ilk celse de ne sordum? Senin amcan senin annen ile bunları yapacak ve üstelik kız kardeşini vahşice öldürecek, sen bu durumda Salim’e ne tepki verirsin? Bana söylediği ne? Hepimiz duyduk. Hiçbir şey elimde olmazsa en azından mutfaktan bıçak alır onu paramparça ederim dedi. Şimdi baz raporunda biz çizilen senaryoya kısaca bakalım. Salim 14:52’de kendi ikâmetinden çıkıyor, 15:18’de dışarıda Arif’in evinin civarında. Tabi bu arada senaryoya göre çocuk patikaya çıkalı 4 dakika olmuş; Salim 15:22’de de eve giriyor. 15:22 ile 15:26 arasında mutfağın karşısındaki boş odada olduğunu söylüyor. Diğer bir durum, Nevzat’ı biz 15:40’da çocuğu dere yatağına götürürken görmedik mi? Kameralarda görmedik mi? Bakın baz raporu Nevzat için diyor ki, 16:00’da Narin Güran’ın cesedi bulunduğu yerde. Evet haklısınız, bilime inanmamak aptallıktır. Ya Avukat bey sen bilime inanmıyor musun? Ben de diyorum ki, ben bilime inanıyorum da bu raporu bilimsel zannediyorsun, senin hatan orada hemşehrim. Son olarak aynı raporda Nevzat Bahtiyar 16:35’te Narin Güran’ın cesedinin bulunduğun yerden ayrılarak Nevzat Tavşantepe’ye geliyor. Ya Arif’in tabiri ile bu Nevzo bu Nevzo o sıralarda baldızı Zinet Dalar’ın bulunduğu Gönenli tarafındaki evinde değil miydi? Biz bunları ifade ve kayıtlardan görmedik mi? Evet sayın başkan, Avrupa İnsan Hakları Mahkemesince şüpheden sanık yararlanır ilkesinin ele alındığı en önemli kararlardan birisi Tafner Avusturya kararıdır. Bu kararda özetle yerel mahkemenin temyiz mahkemelerinin sanığın yalnızca polisin soruşturma raporu ile mahkûm edildiğine, mahkemenin polisin soruşturma raporunda belirttiği şüpheli hususlara dayanarak karar verdiğine, mahkûmiyete dayanarak dayanak olarak gösterilen delillerin kesin ve tek bir sonuç olarak sanığın suçluluğunu oluşturamadığına, bunlara rağmen bu şekilde bir karar verilmesinin yargı makamlarının sanığın suçluluğu bakımından ön yargılı oldukları izlenimi verdiğine, bu şekilde sözleşmenin 6. maddesinin 2. fıkrasını ihlal ettiğine yer vermiştir. Şimdi olayımızda Jandarma tutanaklarını düşünecek olursak benzerliği hemen anlayabilirsiniz. Sayın başkan, sabrınız için teşekkür ediyorum. Bizim müvekkil ile ilgili son olarak sizden istirhamım; müvekkilimizin tahliyesini, neticesinden beraatını ancak bunu yapamıyorsanız da müvekkilim hakkında vereceğiniz karar en azından ev hapsi verilmesini, bu mağduriyetin giderilmesini sayın mahkemeden sayın heyetinizden istirham ediyorum. Sizlere çok teşekkür ediyorum.",

    "text": "Av. Muhammed Fatih DEMİR ​\n\nAçılış Beyanı ve Etik Durum ​\nNarin’in ağabeyi Enes. O kadar kolay olmamalı bir insanı, katledilen küçük Narin’in ağabeyini itham etmek. Bu kadar kolay olmamalı. Haksız itham da haksız hüküm kadar çok sakıncalıdır. Ama itham etmek çok kolaydır. Savunmak daha zordur. Kanaatimce en zoru da hüküm vermektir. En zoru şurada size düşüyor sayın yargıçlar. Şimdi şunu belirteyim. Beni ilk bu dosyaya dahil olduğumuzda Narin dosyasını fiziki ve dijital olarak oluşturduğumuzda her yerde Narin olarak dosyanın adını yazdık. Enes Güran yazmadık. Benim tüm dosyalarımda müvekkilimin adı yazar ama Narin’in adını yazdık. Niye Narin’in adını yazdık? Sanık müdafiliğidir. En beter suç savunulur. Kimse de karışamaz. Anayasa’dan gelen yetkimiz var. Bile bile savunma yapmamak yönünde bir hissiyatımız olduğu için avukatın geliri konuşuluyor burada. Tabii ki de avukatız, tabii ki de gelir elde etmek durumundayız. Burada meslek icra eden herkes gibi ama ben açık söylüyorum. Ben Narin’in katilinden bir gelir elde etmek istemedim buna ihtiyacım yok. Buradaki meslektaşlarımın da olmadığını düşünüyorum. Önce bunu bir aydınlatalım. Şimdi tarihi bir sorumluluğu olan bir dava. Biz bu davanın aktörleriyiz. Hukuk kitaplarına geçecek. Dünya hukuku bence konuşacak, belki kitaba dönüşecek, belki filme dönüşecek gerçekten bu olacak. Kıymetli bir dava.\n\n\nEnes’in Savunması ve Yargılama İlkeleri ​\nŞimdi sanık Enes Güran’ın müdafisi olduğum için sanık Enes üzerinden bir savunma yapacağım. Şimdiden Narin’in cesedine doğrudan teması bulunan Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın beyanlarına da özel bir sayfa açacağım. Bunu kıymetli görüyorum. Bizim maddi gerçeğe ulaşma sürecinde bizi sürekli sekteye uğratan şahıs Nevzat Bahtiyar’dır. Uyduruk raporlardır, ucube raporlardır, o yüzden ne bir doğru, ne bir yanlış onu bu savunma ile göstermeye çalışacağız. Narin’in ağabeyi Enes buradaki, salondaki herkese söylüyorum; yani bu kadar kolay olmamalı, bu kadar acımasız olmamalıyız. Yazık günah bu insan 21 Ağustos 2024 tarihinde Enes’ten bahsediyorum bir darbe yedi Enes. İddianame düzenlendi ikinci öldürücü darbe. Şimdi insanlar ne istiyorlar, mahkumiyet ile tamamen öldürelim Enes’i. Enes’i de öldürelim. İdam dediğimiz şey fiilen sadece bir insanın boynuna ip bağlamak değil ki. Bir insanın kişiliğini öldürebilirsiniz. Bir insanın insan olma haysiyetini öldürebilirsiniz. İnsanlar idam istiyorlar. Biz bu idamı kabul etmiyoruz. Biz bu idam talebini reddediyoruz. Böyle bir dünya yok. Bakıyorum paylaşımlara, insanlar diyorlar ki, sanıkların en ağır ceza almasını, bir dakika, sanıklar en ağır cezayı alsın diyorsun ya, sanıklardan biri masumsa ne olacak o durumda? Sanıkların değil, fail veyahut faillerin en ağır cezayı almasını istememiz lazım. Biz niye mahkemede yargılama makamlarından adalet istiyoruz? Pekala, her zaman adalet olsun fakat adalet, dosyadaki bilgi belge ve deliller ile mümkün olabilir. Görülebilenler ile mümkün olabilir. Ya görünmeyenler var ise? Ya duyulmayanlar var ise? Ya hissedilmeyenler var ise? İşte o yüzden ben CMK’sız gezmiyorum. Geçen celsede size söyledim. Ben gezmiyorum. O yüzden CMK madde 223, yani bu kanunu ihdas eden vekillerimiz, yani Türk milleti olarak ifade edilen Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisinin Mensupları demişler ki, bir yargıç yahut yargıçlar önlerine gelen somut uyuşmazlıkta eğer sanığın fiili işlediğini sabit olarak belirleyemiyorsa beraat kararı verecekler. Bu kadar. Bunu istiyor. Biz kararın üst başlığında Türk Milleti Adına ifadesini kullanıyorsak, o zaman da milletin dediğine uymak zorundayız. Kıymetli yargıçlar, böyle deniyor. Bu niye deniyor? Çünkü yasa koyucumuz bir tercihte bulunuyor. Yasa koyucumuz diyor ki, benim gönlüm razı gelmiyor diyor. Ben az da olsa masumiyet ihtimali olan birinin cezalandırılması riskine girmiyorum diyor. Geçen celse bir çok ilkeden bahsettim. Bir tane daha ilke de var. Masumların cezalandırılmasını önleme riskidir. Ceza muhakemesinde bunun için kanun koyucu tartışmasız maddeler koymuştur. Yoruma kapalıdır, dün burada Türk Ceza Kanunu’nun amaçsal yorumundan bahsedildi. Bir dakika ceza hukukunda amaçsal yorum yok. Genişletemezsin. Kıyas yasağı vardır. Pekala. Usul kanunlarında yorum olur ama ceza kanununda mümkün değil. Bu TCK’nun 37 maddesini dar yorumlamak zorundasın. Herkes korkuyor. Ya bu arada beraat kararı verilirse o şahıslardan biri daha sonradan suçlu olduğu anlaşılırsa korkmayın. Korkmayın CMK’da var, yargılamanın yenilenmesi de var. Şartları çok ağır. CMK madde 314 şartları ağır ama var. Eğer hatalı bir hüküm verilirse bu hatalı hükmün nasıl ortadan kaldırılacağını yasa koyucu düzenlemiş ama yasa koyucu bu şartları çok ağır öngörmüş. Niye? Çünkü yasa koyucu yargıçlarına güveniyor. Yasa koyucu diyor ki, yargıçlarımın bir yere kadar hata yapmasını kabul edebilirim diyor. O kadar ki, hata riskini göz ardı edebilirim diyor ama yasada sınırlı olarak belirttiğim nedenler hasıl olursa o zaman yargılamayı bir daha yenileyelim diyor. Şimdi iddia makamına ve kolluğa çokça eleştiride bulunacağım. Şahıslar ile hiçbir sorunum yok. Az önce meslektaşlarım da bahsetti. Biz iyi niyetli, yani Narin’in katilini bulma yönlü çabasında olduğumuzu düşünüyoruz ama ön yargılar var. Ön yargısız olmalı diyor. Geçen bahsettiğim, savcılara ilişkin etik belgede savcı diyor, ön yargısız olmalı. Niye bunu diyor? İlkeleri çok severim. Diyor ki, bak mesela bir ilke daha da var. Biz avukatların diyor, müvekkilleri sadece bürosunda diyor, veyahut adliyede görüşebilir diyor. Çok saçma gözüküyor değil mi? Ama yüzlerce yıllık savunma pratiği göstermiştir ki avukatın nitelikteki yerlerde görüşme yapması daha sağlıklıdır. Bin tane örnek sayabilirim. Burada savcılara ilişkin ilkeler de bu amaçla var ama yargıçlara ilişkin de var. Hepsi bir hatanın bir deneyimin ürüdür, kıymetlidir. Burada bir kez daha söylüyorum. Şahıslar ile ilgili sorunum yoktur fakat bu makamları işgal eden şahısların insan oldukları için yanılabileceklerinden, bu yanılgıları ben de burada belirtmek durumundayım. Bir kez daha söylüyorum; bir amacım da bir daha küçük bir kız çocuğunun katledilmesi vakasında böyle bariz hatalar yapılmasın. Sen devletsin. Ya böyle bir şey olabilir mi? Bir buçuk kilometrelik bir alanda küçük bir kız çocuğunun cansız bedenini bulamıyorsun; o onu dedi, bu bunu dedi, şu şunu söyledi, burada şu oldu, bizi yanlış yönlendirdi. Ya güvenmeyeceksin. Bakın ben avukat olarak asla müvekkillerime güvenmem. Benim meslek deneyiyim bana bunu gösteriyor. Mesleğimin, savunma makamının deneyimi, ben müvekkilime güvendiğim an hata yapacağım. Ona güvenmeyeceğim, onu sorgulayacağım. Öyle onun beyanını burada duruşma salonlarında ya da başka bir yerde paylaşacağım. Dolayısıyla biz bu mazeretleri kabul etmiyoruz. İddianamede ve esas hakkındaki mütalaada soruşturmanın yanlış yönlendirildiği iddiasının üçüncü şahıslara, devlet görevlisi olmayan şahıslara yöneltilmesini kabul etmiyoruz. Hayır. Soruşturmadan yanlış yönlendirme riskini bertaraf edemeyen kolluk görevlileri sorumludur. Şimdi kıymetli yargıçlar, ben biliyorsunuz celse arasında bu 46201 no’lu dosyaya taktım. Sürekli istiyorum sizden, sürekli. Diyorum ki, gelsin. Gittim oradaki Cumhuriyet Savcısına dosya inceleme talebi attım. Çok absürttür yani kısıtlama kararı olan dosyada niye insan dosya inceleme talebi atsın bir avukat? İstedim, üzerine de yazdım, şerhimdir. Şerh düşmek istedim çünkü bariz bir hukuk hatasıdır. Daha geçen celse kıymetli savcımız dedi ki 46201 sayılı dosyada suç tanımı yaptı. Suç delillerini yok etme gizleme, değiştirme, suçluyu kayırma artık CMK okumaya gerek var mı? Böyle bir suçlamada, böyle bir ithamda kısıtlama kararı devam edebilir mi? Bunu hangi akıl kabul edebilir? Yok. O zaman ben de size söylerim. Siz kısıtlama kararı olan bir dosyadaki veri, delil, ve bilgileri burada kullanamazsınız. Eşit olmak zorundayız. Sizin gördüğünüz tüm delilleri ben de görmek zorundayım. Baştan söylüyorum. Bu yönde gerekçeli kararda herhangi bir şey olursa çok özür dileyerek söylüyorum. Olmayacak? Pekala o zaman.\n\n\nKısıtlama Kararı ve “Güran Ailesi” Kavramı Eleştirisi ​\nBu yönlü, madem ki kısıtlama kararı var, madem ki hüküm verilecek, artık geçmiş olsun. Savcılık makamına o dosyada bir şey varsa da artık kullanamayacağız. Deliller açıkça ortaya konulur, açıkça tartışılır. CMK bize bunu söylüyor. Yapmadılar, bunun sorumluluğu da artık onların üzerinedir. Tarihsel sorumlulukları var. Bunu tercih ettiler. Pekala, şimdi kıymetli yargıçlar, geçen celse meslektaşımız da bahsetmişti. Mahir Bey’in Güran ailesi kavramı kıymetli bir nokta. Niye kıymetli bir nokta? Ben esas hakkındaki yazılı savunma dilekçemde düşman ceza hukukundan bahsettim. Çok riskli bir şey. Genelde politif davalarda kullanılır. Niye bundan bahsettim? Siz bir insana doğrudan insani tekleri gösterecek vasıfları kullanmazsanız, yani anne yani baba yani ağabey gibi vasıfları, kavramları kullanmazsanız, o insana saldırabilirsiniz. Artık karşınızda Narin’in ağabeyi yoktur. Narin’in babası yoktur. Narin’in annesi yoktur. Narin’in amcası yoktur. Artık karşınızda Güran ailesinin fertleri vardır. Saldır! Rahatça saldır. Kamuoyunu da arkana almışsın. Haberlere de paylaşmışsın. Yazmışsın da yazmışsın. Bu tanımlamayı biz reddediyoruz. Böyle bir tanımlama yok. Böyle bir saldırı mantığı yok. Burada yargılanan 4 tane sanık vardır. Bu sanıkların vasfı da ortadadır ve bellidir. İddia makamının iddianamede ve esas hakkındaki mütalaada Güran ailesi ya da ailesinin fertleri olarak belirtmiş olduğu kavramın altında delilleri karartma olarak ifade edebileceğimiz beyanlarını desteklemesi kabul edilemezdir. Kabul edilememesinin bir sebebi şudur; bu ancak bir iddiadır çünkü hüküm onun üzerine inşa edilmeyecektir. Hüküm buradaki 4 kişinin cinayet fiilinin faili olup olmadığı üzerine kurulacaktır. Bu kadar dolayısıyla oradaki uzun uza diye anlatılan beyanlar bu sebeple temelsizdir. Bunlara katılmak mümkün değildir. Sayın yargıçlar, bir de müsaadeniz ile flash şey yapabilir miyiz? Yalnız ben görmüyorum.\n\n\nHakaret İddiası ve Silahların Eşitliği Prensibi ​\nSilahlar eşit olsun madem ben de bu beyanı gösteriyorum. Hangi hukukçu bu ifadeye hakaret değil der? İfadeyi ben şöyle bir dakika sesli okuyayım. Hayır, şimdi şöyle izah edeyim, zaten görmesi gerekenler görüyor. Çok kısa, bir kullanıcı Arif Güran’dan bahsederek “bu köydeki herkes potansiyel faildir bu şerefsiz de dahil”. Ezberimden söyledim umarım yanılmamışımdır. Bu soruşturma numarasını vereyim, 2024/56920. Her savcımın, her yargıcımın kararına saygım sonsuz fakat mademki o 46201’i kullanıyor, ben de size bundan bahsedeyim. Burada Cumhuriyet Savcımız matbu ifadeler ile kopyala yapıştır. Tüm hakaretlerimiz hakkında dedi ki, matufiyet oluşmamıştır. Takipsizlik kararı veriyorum. Ya bu insanlar insan değil mi? Arif Güran insan değil mi? Arif Güran vatandaş değil mi? Arif Güran yurttaş değil mi? Arif Güran niye ceza kanunun ona sağlamış olduğu mağdur statüsüne haiz olamıyor? Buradaki tavır, buradaki yaklaşım bunu göstermek için bu hakareti gösterdim. Yok, hala bunun hakaret olmadığını, matufiyet olmadığını söyleyen var ise sabaha kadar tartışabilirim.\n\n\nİşkence İddiaları ve Soruşturma Yetkisinin Paylaşılması ​\nŞimdi yine sayın savcımız mütalaaya ek bir cümle ekledik. Bu çoban Ahmet meselesindeki şikayete tabi suçlar ile alakalı ihbarda bulunmasını istedi heyetinizden. Ben sayın savcıma şunu söylemek istiyorum. Geçen celse o kadar burada tanık dinlendi, sanık dinlendi. O kadar işkenceden kötü muameleden bahsedildi, bilmiyorum yani. Ben şahsen müvekkilime bunu öğretmedim. Yani ben tiyatro hocası değilim. Yani bu çok nitelikli dram gerektiriyor. Yani bana şunu yaptılar, bana şunu izlettiler, bana bunu söylettiler, çok affedersiniz işim gücüm yok bunu müvekkilime öğretecek halim de yok. Bunlar apaçık ciddi iddialardır. Bunların soruşturulması gerekiyor. Ben bilmiyorum, biz Türkiye’de hukukçular olarak bir devleti koruma refleksimiz var. Ben bunu aşamıyorum. Devlet dediğin sensin, benim, biziz. Devlet bu. Bir kutsaliyet ifadesi belirterek devleti koruma refleksi bize hata yaptırır. Bizim devletimizdir. Pekala, biz bu develetin ferdiyiz, pekala ne de olsa zararı da bizedir, pekala ama yargılamada devlet yok. Çok affedersiniz, şunu diyemez miydik iddia makamına, devlet adına hareket eden yok, devlet dememişler. Kamu adına kamu eşit değildir devlet. Yine biz şunu diyemez miydik, hüküm ve kararların üzerine devlet adına karar veriliyor. Hayır, Türk Milleti Adına karar veriliyor diyor. Millet bunu bilerek diyor. Bu teknik, bu bir tercihtir. Dolayısıyla o yönde de eleştiri de bulunmak istiyorum. Eğer o Ahmet Çoban meselesinde ihbarda bulunmasına talep ediyorsanız, işkence iddiaları da ciddi iddialardı. İhbarda bulunulması gerektiği kanaatindeyim. Şimdi yine soruşturma makamına ilişkin eleştirilerim devam ediyor. Bir sorunumuz daha var. Bizim ceza muhakeme kanunumuz hatta bu kanun yürürlüğe girdiği zaman şöyle dediler. Dediler ki, kanun koyucu cumhuriyet savcısı soruşturmanın imparatoru yapmıştır. Doğrudur. Yetkisi çoktur, soruşturmanın kaptanıdır, soruşturmanın yetkili kişisidir. Bunu niye yapıyor? Kanun koyucu niye soruşturmayı sadece kolluk mensuplarına bırakmıyor? Suçu suçluyu bulmakta bence naçizane görüşüm daha etkililer. Sahadalar çünkü biz Üniversitede, hukuk fakültesinde bir suçlu nasıl bulunur, bir fiil nasıl aydınlatılır, öğrenmiyoruz. Hukuk bilgileri öğreniyoruz ama kanun koyucu ne yapmış? Gitmiş, soruşturma makamının başına savcıyı koymuş çünkü kanun koyucu hukukçuya güveniyor, hukukçu yapacakmış diyor, hukukçu emredecek diyor. Çok özür diliyorum burada emredilen kişi zayıf değildir. Bir makama işgal etmektedir. Herkes cübbesini çıkarttığında herkes eşittir ama iş yapılırken farklı bir organizma var. Orada emredecek diyor. Bizim bu dosyada cumhuriyet savcılarımızın emrettiğini ben düşünmüyorum. Yetki paylaşmışlar çok tehlikeli bir şey yapmışlar. Çok tehlikeli bu. Veremezsin. Onun iyiliği için bile olsa veremezsin. O bilmez. Bazen biz konuşuyoruz, bizim de var polis tanıdıklarımız, komiser tanıdıklarımız bize soruyorlar. Avukat bey bunu nasıl, niye soruyorlar? Çünkü, evet suçu ve suçluyu bulmakta iyi fakat bir takım hukuk bilgileri onda olmadığı için kaygılı. O yüzden buradaki soruşturmadaki absürt nokta problemleri, noktalardan bir tanesi de bu yetkinin paylaşılmış olmasıdır. Yetki kollukla paylaşılamaz. Emredecekti. Emretmemin başımıza bunlar geldi. Şimdi yine kıymetli yargıçlar, biz diyoruz ki, ceza muhakemesi hukuku bir çatışma alanıdır. Ortada bir çatışma var. Çatışma şu, yasa koyucunun ön görmüş olduğu suç bu suçtan görülen fiili gerçekleştirmekle o şahıs esasında toplum barışını tehdit etmekte, bir çatışma meydana getiriyor. Çatışmanın tarafında, bir tarafında bu toplum barışını tehdit eden kişiler bir yandan da onun hakları var. Biz bu çatışmanın nasıl yönetileceğini CMK’dan öğreniyoruz. CMK kanun koyucumuz yine bu çatışmadan kavramları bilerek seçmişim. Bakın çok az bilinen bir şey olduğunu düşünüyorum. Alman Ceza Mahkemesi Kanununda ifade neden olmak tutuklama nedeniyken bizim kanun koyucumuz bunu ön görmemiş.\n\n\nDelil Sunumu ve “Siyaseten Katil” Kavramı ​\nYine kıymetli yargıçlar, yine ceza muhakemesi kanunumuz delillerin asılları ile irad ve ikame edeme kurallarını ön görmüştür. Yani bir beyan delili soruşturma makamı tarafından tutanakla sunuluyorsa bu beyan delillinin duruşma salonunda olduğu hali ile, aslı ile konuşturulmak suretiyle ortaya konması gerekir. Burada jandarma tutanaklarında bir ton beyan delili tutanağa bağlanmış. Bu şahıslar burada dinlenmedi. Hangi moral ile yazdığını bilmiyorum. Ben onu sorgulamadım. Dolayısıyla bu jandarmanın tutmuş olduğu aleyhe tutanakları zaten lehe bir tane tutanak yok. Yav ben anlamadım, bu insanların bir tane lehe işi yok mu? Bir tane lehlerine delil yok mu? Bir de kıymetli yargıçlar, bizim coğrafyamızın geçmişinde bir kavram var. Başka bir konu ile tartışırken Av. Mahir bey ile benim de aklıma bu dava geldi. Diyor ki, siyaseten katil, yani devletin ali menfaatleri gerektiriyorsa bir şahsı siyaseten katledebilirsin. Mesela Padişah kundaktaki kardeşini öldürebilir, siyaseten katildir, meşrudur ve ahlaki görülüyor. Biz Türkiye Cumhuriyeti’nin fertleri, Cumhuriyetimiz bunu reddediyor. Siyaseten katil yasaktır. Çok büyük bir suçtur. Dolayısıyla bu dosyada da bir takım muhaliflerce devletin ali menfaatlerinin bu şahısların cezalandırılması olduğu yönündeki açıklamalara da bir savunma olması açısından bunu belirttim. Ben sizin heyetinizin bunlara itibar edeceğini düşünmüyorum ama yine de bunu belirtmek istedim. Hakikaten de koyuncu dedim. Bir masumun cezalandırılması riskine girmemiş, bunun yanında yine çok sevdiğim bir yargıç Sami SELÇUK hukuki tanıda yanılgı. Bir kitap. Bu orada bir yargıcın yasa kuralını uygularken dikkat etmesi gerektiğine, çok özür diliyorum haddim değildir ama ben bunu kıymetli gördüğüm için açıklama yapmak istiyorum.\n\n\nYargıcın Görevleri ve Masumiyet Kanaati ​\nDiyor ki, Sami hoca eski Yargıtay başkanlığı da yapmış diye biliyorum. Yargıtay her türlü savcılığı yapmıştı da aynı zamanda. Yazılı hukuk diyor. Söz gelimi bir yasa, yargıcın hukuk anlayışına uymayabilir. CMK’nun 223/2’yi beğenmeyebiliriz ancak yargıç onu uygulamak zorundadır. Bir yargıç, hukukçu bir yurttaş olarak yazılı hukuku yani olan hukuku olması gereken hukuk açısından bir bilimsel çalışma yaparak elbette ele alabilir, eleştirebilir. Eleştirmelidir de. O onun hukuka topluma karşı yerine getirmesi gereken sıradan bir görevdir. Çünkü her hukukçu gibi yargıç da 24 saat yargılama yapmaz ama kendine ve herkese karşı sorumlu bir bireydir. Bu yüzden de hem bir düşünce üreticisi müçtehit, hem bir toplum önderi ve yol göstericisi mürşit, hem de hukuk savaşçısı yani mücahittir. Bunun doğal sonucu da şudur; Söz konusu eleştiri ödevini yerine getirmek ne kahramanlıktır, ne de yüreklilik görevini yerine getirmekten kaçınılamaz. Bu bir kahramanlılık, yüreklilik olsun ancak yargılama yaparken de yazılı hukuku, örneğin bir yasayı, iyidir kötüdür diye yargı kararını eleştiremez. Uygulamaktan da kaçınamaz çünkü yargılama yürürlükteki yasalara göre ve yürürlükteki yasaları uygulamak için yapılır. Olması gereken hukuku uygulamak için değil, Sokrates ne der? adaleti lütfetmek değil, herkesin hakkını vermek, kendi keyfine değil yasalara uyarak hüküm vermektir. Yine Montaigne diyor ki, yasalara yasa oldukları için saygı gösterilir ve uyulur, doğru oldukları için değil. Bunlardan niye bahsettim? CMK 223/2 de bir yasadır. Bu dosya nazarında sübut, yani sabit olup olmamak şeklinde yargılamadan beklenen amaç mümkün gözükmüyor. Yani şahsen bir hukukçu olarak kendi kanaatimi bir türlü netleştiremiyorum. Kendi müvekkilim hakkımda kanaatim net. Ben onu Yusuf’a benzetiyorum. Hz. Yusuf’a benzetiyorum. Ben diyorum ona da geçen sefer de söyledim. Onu kuyuya atan kudret, onu yine Mısır’ın emiri yapmaya muktedirdir. Ben sakin müsterih olmasını talep ediyorum. Ondan biz onun mücadelesini vereceğiz. Onu her gördüğümde aklıma o geliyor. Şimdi sizden ricam orada bir evrak daha açmanızı isteyeceğim.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Çelişkili ve Kurgu Beyanları ​\nO zaman çok uzatmayacağım bu kısmı. Şimdi burada Nevzat Bahtiyar adlı sanığın ifadeleri toplam 7 idi. Dün itibari ile 8 oldu. Yer gösterme de dahil. Ben onu konulara ayırdım. O gün neredeydin? Salim seni ne için aradı? Şu an kafadan ezbere söylüyorum, sana cesedi nasıl teslim etti? Teslim aldıktan sonra ne yaptın? Orada bayağı böyle aslında daha uzun bir çalışma olacaktı ama zaman bu kadar elverdi. Şimdi bu niye önemli? Ben bunu inşallah PDF’e çevirip hükümden önce teslim edeceğim. Zaman kalırsa incelersiniz. Eğer şimdi ben bunu niye yaptım? Yazılı dilekçemde de yazdım. Bir sanığın çelişkili beyanda bulunması onun aleyhinedir. Yargıç ne yapsın? Yargıç haklı. Önüne gelen kişi yalan söylüyor. Yalan söylediği tespit ediliyor ona niye güvensin? Dolayısıyla çelişkili beyan meselesi önemli fakat çelişkili beyanının yanında bir kavram daha var. Kurgu yaratma. Kurgu yaratma daha beter. Sanık sadece çelişkili beyanda bulunmuyor, başka bir hikaye meydana getiriyor, anlatıyor. Şimdi göreceksiniz. Kıymetli yargıçlar, o Bahtiyar’ın bu güzel bir metot yani o daha tek tek sayfaları karıştırmaktansa konu bazlı ayrım daha çok işimize yarıyor. Şimdi bakacağız, şunu göreceğiz. Nevzat Bahtiyar inanılmaz zeki. Gerçekten zeki. Ben onun çok zeki olduğunu düşünüyorum. O kadar zeki ki, o dakika ona soruluyor “O gün hiç Salim’i aradın mı?”. “Aramadım” diyor. Aradan biraz zaman geçiyor, telefonum var şimdi hatırladım, şu sebepten aradım diyor. İfadelerde yine bu tarz kolluğun yanlış soru taktikleri. Boşuna demiyorlar. Kolluk başına birkaç soru soracak, yorum katmayacak, yönlendirmeyecek. Sadece ne nedir, ne nasıldır, bu kadar sor. Sonradan zaten savcılar yargıçlar onun çelişkilerini bulup onu düşürecekler, merak etme. Ama yok, bunu yapmamışlar. O bir takım soru tarzlarını veri paylaşımı olduğu anlaşılıyor. Kurgu yaratıyor. Ben korna ve selektöre takmıştım mesela. İlk bu davayı aldığımızda dedim. Mesela dedim, bu çok nitelikli ayrıntı. Hani bunu sağlamak kolay değil. Korna ve selektör. Bir baktım, ilerleyen süreçte konu eve geldi. Bud a çok nitelikli. Bu kadar hızlı değişimler çok ilginç. Benim vicdanım kabul etmiyor. “Nevzat katildir” diyemem. Ona siz karar vereceksiniz. Benim buna hakkım da yok ama şimdi bu beyana bir şey demeyelim mi? Bu çok problemli bir şey. Bu çelişki değil. Bu kurgu yaratıyor. Çelişkili diyebileceğim bir şey Narin’in naaşı kendisinin uhdesinde. Bakın teslim demiyorum, öyle bir tespit olamaz. Kendinin uhdesinde. Şöyle ifade edeyim. Köyden ayrıldıktan sonraki dere kenarına geldiği süre zarfına kadar hemen hemen uyuyor. Ufak tefek değişiklikler var. Orada sıkıntı yok. Yine bilgi alma tutanağındaki “O gün Çarıklı’daydım” şeklindeki külliyen yalan olan ifadesi haricinde, saat 15:08’e kadar olan hareketliliklerinde anlatırken ufak tefek çelişkiler var. Orada da bir sıkıntı yok ama saat 15:08 geldiğinde Nevzat kuduruyor. Orada bambaşka bir şey görüyoruz. Orada çelişki yok, kurgu var. Ben hala da diyorum, hiçbir şeyine inanmıyorum. 15:08 telefon aramasından sonra ben dün kendisine sordum ya, hem annenin evinden muslukla su çekiyorsun bir elinde hortum var, hortuma gidiyorsun, hem de diyorsun ki onu su için aradım. Bu çok çelişkili bir beyandır. Elinde su var. Ya suya ulaşıyorsun, niye o gün? Niye o saat? Biz eşinin beyanlarından da görüyoruz ki o gün köyde de olmaması gerekiyor. Başka yerde olması gerekiyor. O gün diyor “Çarıklı’ya gitti, geri döndü” diyor. O saatte suyun içeriği, bilmiyorum, o sorulma nedeni bu ise bana samimi gelmiyor. Su için aradım. Niye su için arıyorsun? Sizden rica etsem bir tane şey var. Orada ‘cami Nevzat Patika Tepe’ diye geçmesi lazım. PDF var. Şimdi kıymetli, kıymetli yargıç şimdi ışığı kapatsak iyi olur sanki. Sağımdakiler de görür.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Olay Yeri Yakınlığı ve Beyan Tutarsızlıkları ​\nŞimdi dün Nevzat Bey’e sordum. Dedim ki, sen dedim annenden hortumu çekiyordun, suyu nasıl açıyordun diye sordum ona. Gerçekten bir tarafa bilmediğim bir soru sordum. Genelde bilirim sorularımın cevaplarını. Sordum, bana öyle bir cevap verdi ki tam bu diyebileceğim cevabı verdi. Bana dedi ki, annemin evinin avlusundan ona benzer bir ifade, dedi suyu çekiyorum. Şimdi saat 15:08’de Salim ile konuştun, ondan sonra gittin patlıcan sulamaya. O gün o saatte patlıcan suluyorsun. O da ilginç. Şimdi, tamam ben burada inanayım sana. Hani burada diyeyim ki doğru söylüyor olabilir, dikkate alayım. Artık sen 52 yaşındasın, akıllı bir adam olduğunu da söylüyorum senin. Bak beyanların nelere iş açıyor. Eğer söylediklerim doğru değilse 15:08’de sen evden çıktın, nereye çıktın, geldin? Şurada kıymetli arkadaşlar, bak ben burada salona doğru göstereyim. Bu onun evi. Ya evin önünden çıktığında şuraya geliyor. Annesinin evine, annesinin evine geldiği zaman saat 15:08’den sonrasından bahsediyoruz. Cami burada. Çıktığı zaman Narin’i görme ihtimali çok yüksek. Şuradan görünüyor. Gidelim keşif yapalım. Görünür yapmayalım, yine Google’dan bakalım. Görünür. Burada su hani onun tabiri ile söylüyorum. Annesinin evine gidip su musluğunu açtığı zaman burada Narin’i görüyor, geri geliyor, şu tarafa sulama işlemi yaptığını söylüyor, değil mi? Yine bakın Narin buradan çıkacak ya tepeye, yine çıkacağı zaman o saat diliminde o dakikalarda Narin’i görmeme ihtimali yok gibi bir şey. Şimdi bu mekandan bahsediyorum. Şu bölge çok kıymetli, çok önemli. Az önce videoda göstermeye çalıştık. Eksen kayması dediğimiz yer, açı kayması dediğimiz yer aslında şurayı ifade ediyor. Şimdi Narin’in camiden geldiği dakika ile evine doğru saptığı dakika arasında Nevzat Bahtiyar kendi beyanları ile, şaşmaz bu hiç şaşmaz, buralarda takılıyor. Ben diyor, Narin’i görmedim diyor. Ben buna inanmam, inanamam. Narin i gördün. Yani olay burada gerçekleşti. Diyorlar ya, bu ilginç bir tesadüf mü? Bir tarafta olay gerçekleşiyor, bir tarafta Nevzat buralarda takılıyor. Bu çok acayip bir şey. Bu çok acayip bir tesadüf. Ben onu size söyleyeyim. Şimdi o dakikalarda, Narin’in yürüdüğü o dakikalarda Narin’e en yakın olan şahıs Nevzat Bahtiyar.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Motivasyonu ve Araç Meselesi ​\nBu dosyadaki deliller net olarak bunu söylüyor. Ona en yakın olan. Bu kendi beyanları. Dosyadaki diğer şaşmaz objektif olan, veriler bunu ortaya koyuyor, dolayısıyla onun hakkında olumsuz kanaate de kapılmamız olağandır, normaldir. Yine bu dünkü duruşmada biraz toparlamaya çalıştı ama önceki celse batırdı. Bir cümle söyledi. Dedi ki, ben aslında dedi, naaşı oradan alacaktım, dedi. Başka bir yere götürecektim dedi. O zaman bırakacaktım falan deme hatırlamıyorum okumadım siz bakarsınız, yanıltmış olmayayım. Sen cinayetin asli faili değilsin, doğrudan faili değilsin, müşterek faili değilsin ama gidiyorsun naaşı koyduğun yeri değiştirmek istiyorsun. Niye değiştirmek istiyorsun? Senin motivasyonun ne? Burada kimse bulmamış, kimse görmemiş, bu değiştirme yönündeki enerjinin kaynağı ne? Aile görsün diye, işte Narin’in cesedini bulsun diye. İnanmıyorum sana. Sana niye inanayım? Jandarma kapına gelmeyene kadar bir kelime etmemişsin. Jandarma kapına gelmeyene kadar hiçbir şey yapmamışsın. Düşünüyordum yok. Öyle bir düşünceyi kabul etmiyorum. Dosyadaki veriler ile uyuşmuyor senin bu beyanın. Dolayısıyla oradaki hususta bu araba meselesi bir cinayetin gerekçesi olması düşük, gerçekten düşük fakat cinayetin gerekçesi olmamakla beraber Narin’e olan yaklaşımı değiştirebilir. Şöyle değiştirebilir sen gidiyorsun, bir adama 64.000 TL’ye bir araba satıyorsun. Fiyatını sordum ona, doğru bildi. Onu unutmamış. Unutamaz. Para bin lira, iki bin lira. Parası yok diyen adam 60.000 TL gelir beyan etmiş. Sıvacı günlükleri 2.000 lira, 3.000 lira. Az değil. Kendisi öyle beyan etmiş. Kimliğe ilişkin sorulara doğru cevap vermek zorunda. 64.000 TL’ye araba, bu arabayı Arif, bir nevi komisyoncu oluyor, burada komisyonculuk yapmak suretiyle bir başkasına satıyor. Bu işten de 2.000 TL kar ediyor. COVID öncesiydi. Para biraz daha kıymetliydi. Şimdinin her halde 10.000 TL’si falan oluyor. Ucuza bir araba veriyor. 74.000 TL gibi bir şey vadelisi. Tamam, peşinen alınmış, iyi paraya veriyor. Dostluk yapıyor, ona ucuza veriyor. Niye? Yine başka bir hukuk bilgisi kullanacağız. Özür dilerim, evet ayıplı mallar her zaman ucuzdur.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Şüpheli Eylemleri ve Adli Hata İhtimali ​\nAyıplı mal olduğu anlaşıldıktan sonra her zaman alıcı ayıpta bedelde indirim ister ama bedelde indirim gösterilen bedel üzerinden yapılır. Aslında burada Bahtiyar ayıplı olduğunu bildiği aracı önceden indirimini yapmış, veriyor, ucuza veriyor. Hakikaten ucuza veriyor. Daha sonrasında onun önüne bir hesap çıkartılıyor. 80.000 TL. Ben olsam sinirlenirim. Ben olsam kızarım. Hem ucuza araba veriyorsun hem de gelip sende para istiyorlar. 50.000 TL istiyorlar. Bildiğim kadarıyla 40.000 TL vermiş. Ben olsam içerlerim. Keşke benim yanıma gelseydi, ben ona yardımcı olurdum davasında. Yardımcı olurdum. Sormamış, etmemiş çünkü beraber aynı köyde oldukları için burada ona yapılan o muamele kanaatimce bu benim düşüncem, dosyaya yansıyan bir delil yok, Arif’e içerlenmiş. Zaten HTS trafiğine baktığımız zaman Arif’le görüşme sıklığının olmaması. Nedenlerden bir tanesi de bu içerlenmiş hakikaten aşağılamak için söylemiyorum, bir köy yerinde ufak günahlar çok büyük günahlardır aslında. Ufak hatalar çok büyütülüyor. Dolayısıyla orada aramız iyiydi falan, zaten kabul etmiş olsaydı masa kurulmazdı, toplantı edilmezdi. Demek ki, kabul etmemiş ki Nevzat bey bir masa kurulmuş. Kabul etmeme yönünden irade gösteriyor. O parayı vermiyorum diyebiliyor ama nedense bir cesedi alma konusunda hemen tamam diyor. Yani 50.000 TL’yi ödemiyorum ama Narin’in cesedi olduğu zaman hiç sorgulamaksızın hiç düşünmeksizin dakikalar içerisinde teslim alıp dakikalar içerisinde teslim ettiğini söylüyor. Absürt, ilginç. Çok büyük kurgu. Bu 30 dakika boyunca dere kenarında ne yaptığını açıklayamıyor. Onun bahsettiği fiiller kendi beyanı ile oraya dere kenarına koyma şeklinde 30 dakika altında gerçekleşebilir. 3 dakika 5 dakika 10 dakika olsun. Orada ne yaptı? Orası karanlık kalacak karanlık. Kimse görmüyor, kamera görmüyor. O söylemeyene kadar kimse bilmeyecek. 30 dakika boyunca orada ne yaptı? Keşke bir şey yapmasaydı, bilirdik. Söylerdi, bunu hakkında bu beyanı bulunmazdım ama o 52 yaşında akıllı adam. Söylemedi o zaman. Ben de bunu söylerim şimdi. Adli hata gerçekten önemli bir şey. Adli hata her zaman mümkündür. İnsanların olduğu her yerde mümkündür. Yargıçların olduğu yerde de hata mümkündür ki zaten o yüzden kanun yolu var.\n\n\nAdli Hatanın Nedenleri ve Davanın Karmaşıklığı ​\nO yüzden yargılamanın yenilenmesi var. Diyor ki, bir vakıayı adli hataya götüren süreçler nelerdir diye bir bilimsel makale gördüm. Çokça şey var, siz de davalarda görüyorsunuz. Birincisi görgü tanıklarının yanlış teşhisi, kolluk soruşturmasında yapılan yanlışlıklar, hatalar. Bizi neler hataya götürüyor? Savcılıkla yapılan yanlışlıklar, hatalar, adli tıpça yapılan hatalar, sahte itiraflar, sabıkalı kişilerce sunulan uydurma ve güvenilmez kanıtlar, yetersizce yapılan adli yardımlar. Bu dosyada da buna benzer çok şey var. Bizi, yani bizi hataya götürmeye sevk etmeye neden olabilecek çok şey var. Bu dosyada adli hata riskini doğurabilecek başka şeyler de var. Burada yazıyor, medya ve özellikle sosyal medya yargılamasının mahkeme salonunu etkilemesi. Ben o yüzden birinci celse size güveniyorum, biliyorum etkilenmeyeceksiniz dedim ama yine de talepte bulundum. O sebepten basın ve yayın organlarını izlememe talebinde bulundum. Yine adli hataya götüren nedenlerden bir tanesi daha soruşturma aşamasında yapılan hatalar ve yanlışlıklar. Soruşturma başarısızlığı ve gerçek suçlunun gerçek kalması yine kanıtın kusurlu, yanlış duası. Mesela daraltılmış baz çetin davaların niteliği. Parantez içerisinde kanıt yokluğu, kaynak yetersizliği ve mağdur tanıkların işbirliği yapmaması. Bu cinayet çok basit bir nedene dayanmış olmalı. Bunu ben demiyorum, bunu FBI ajanları söylüyor. Ben oturdum, onların makalelerini de okudum. Cinayet ne kadar basitse işin içinden çıkmak o kadar zordur diyor. Cinayetin faili tanığı ne kadar az ise diyor, işin içerisinden çıkmak o kadar zordur diyor. Cinayetin faili, tanığı ne kadar az ise diyor, işin içinden çıkmak o kadar zordur diyor. Şunu demiyor; kim kök suçlu demiyor. Çok kolaydır onu demek. Öyle bir şey olabilir mi? Akıl mantığa uyuyor mu? Çok afedersiniz, yemez yani. Ha karşında o kadar silahla jandarma varken yemez. Çok afedersiniz, zaten jandarma da bunu bildiği için bayağı hırpalamış. Ona rağmen bir şey çıkmamış. Bunun üzerine düşünmemiz gereken bir şeydir. Acaba gerçekten bilmedikleri için konuşmuyor olabilirler mi? Kimsenin niye bu aklına gelmiyor?\n\n\nAdli Hatayı Önleme ve Bilirkişi Raporları Eleştirisi ​\nDolayısıyla kıymetli yargıçlar, adli hataya bizi götürebilecek çok fazla neden var ama bizim bu adli hata riskini bu davanın adli hataya dönüşmesine izin vermememiz gerekiyor. Elimizde enstrümanlar var. CMK 223/2 var, şüpheden sanık yararlanır var. Keşke Enes için, keşke Enes için sanığın suçu işlediğinin sabit olmamasına dayalı bir hüküm gelseydi ama mümkün gözükmüyor çünkü dosyadaki veri ve beyanlar, o karmakarışık hale getirilmiş o kadar çarpıtılmış ki, gelen aşamada dileğim odur, isteğim odur bir hukukçu odur, o yönlü bir savunma yapmayacağım. Ne olacak? Bakın, şimdi soruşturma makamı işini iyi yapmadığı için ne olacak? Bu insan ölene kadar yarın öbür gün büyüyecek, çoluğu olacak, çocuğu olacak, insanlar arasına karışacak. Ölene kadar şüphe nedeniyle beraat alan biri olacak ha? Doğrudur. Beraat kararından kaynaklı aklanma hakkı mevcuttur içerisinde ama şunu da diyemeyecek yani; suçlu kesin olarak budur diye ben beraat edildim. Şimdi daraltılmış baz çalışması ile ilgili kıymetli meslektaşlarım epey bir açıklamada bulundular. Şimdi ben şunu izah ediyorum. Bu raporu tanzim edenler bilirkişi değil. En azından kovuşturma açısından bilirkişi değil. Soruşturma aşamasında zaten geçen celse bahsettim, bilirkişi görevlendirilmesine ilişkin kuralın hiçbirine riayet edilmemiş. Bir şekilde bu rapor dosyaya girmiş. Kıymetli yargıçlar, bir iddianame düzenlendiği zaman iddianamenin ekinde her şey olabilir. Her şey olabilir. Biz oradaki her şeyin nitelendirilmesini kabul etmemiz mümkün olabilir mi? Eğer yargılama makamı onu kabul ediyorsa her şeyi doğru, gerçek o zaman savunma makamının tüm raporlar tüm uzman mütalaaları üzerindeki başlıkta anılmak zorundadır. Silahların eşitliği ilkesi bana bunu söylüyor. Savcılık makamı kamu gücünü kullanmak suretiyle daha kudretlidir. Soruşturma aşamasında ama kovuşturmaya geçtiğimiz ben delillerin eşdeğer olduğunu düşünüyorum. Dolayısıyla savcılık makamı için bu bilirkişi raporu olabilir ama bizim açımızdan bilirkişi olmayacağını savunuyorum ben. Çünkü sizin CMK’ye göre yapmış olduğunuz bir görevlendirme kararı yok. Ek rapor talep ettiniz ama siz ek raporu doğrudan o kişilerden talep etmediniz. Savcılığı aracı kılmak suretiyle istediniz.\n\n\nHatalı Raporlar ve Uzmanlık Tartışması ​\nEsasında o belgenin yine savcılığa dair bir belge olduğu verisi muhafaza edilmiş oldu. Bunlar niye bilirkişi değil? Bunlar bilirkişi listesine kayıtlı değil, evet görevlendirme yapılabilir listede kayıtlı olmayanlardan olabilir. Evet kabul ediyorum ama nasıl yapılabilir? Bilirkişi listesine bak diyor, Van’a bak, ne bileyim Ankara’ya bak. İstanbul da bir ton var. Ben konu alakalı bilirkişi yapan kaç kişi ile görüştüm hepsi bu safsatadır diyor ya bu rapora. Bir uzman mütalaası istiyorum. Hani hazırlayın, ücret teklifi alıyorum, zaten uçan kaçan rakamlar ama yine de biz çoğu kişi hazırlamıyoruz diyorlar. Biz bu dosyada nasıl rapor hazırlayalım? Aman aman bu dosyada rapor hazırlamak kime düşer? Biterler işi biz sanık müdafi olarak biz bu riski göze aldık. Dolayısıyla o daraltılmış baz çalışmasına yönelik etkili delil çalışması yapamamamızın ana nedeni budur ama esasında yapmasak dahi daraltılmış baz çalışmasının defalarca çürütüldüğünü, meslektaşlarım tarafından çürütüldüğünü gördük. Çürütülüyor, durmadan çürütülüyor. Ben geçen celsedeki beyanı tekrar etmeyeceğim. Yeni bir metodun bir yargılamada nasıl kullanılabileceğine ilişkin unsurları izah etmiştim. Yine bir çeviride sundum. O çeviri, evet savunma dilekçemin son sayfasında çeviri hakkında bilgi notu diye bir şey yazdım. Bunu niye yazdım? Dedim ki, bu çeviride bir ton hata olabilir. Bu çeviriyi ben bu program ile yaptırdım. %100 doğruluk iddiam yoktur. Ben bilirkişi değilim. Yani sizi yanıltmamak için elimden gelen her şeyi yaptım. Keşke bu raporu da hazırlayanlar da bunu yapsaydı ama yapmadılar. Niye yapmadıklarına girmek istemiyorum. Girsek işin içerisinden çıkamayız ama şuna eminim, kasten gerçeğe aykırı rapor düzenlemek suçtur. Bunun mücadelesini vereceğiz. Bu suçtan yargılanmaları için elimizden geleni yapacağız ki başka bir yargılamada bir masum bu şeylere maruz kalmasın.\n\n\nDiyarbakır Barosu’nun Rolü ve Katılan Sıfatı ​\nŞimdi yine kıymetli yargıçlar, ben şimdi Diyarbakır Barosu’na geleyim. Katılan taraf şu an burada değiller. Kendilerini temsil edenler burada değiller. Çokça Diyarbakır Barosu meslektaş vardı. Eminim salonda kıymetli bir baro, kıymetli işler yapmış ama bu dosyada çok yanlış konumlandırdı kendini. Çok yanlış! Sayın heyet. Heyetiniz daha önceden pek görünmeyen bir karar verdi. Şu yönde görünmeyen; her zaman toplumsal olaylarda, kamuoyuna mal olmuş davalarda barolar barolar birliği gelirdi, katılma sıfatında bulunurdu. Suçtan doğrudan doğruya zarar görmedikleri için red kararını alıp giderlerdi. Ben de bir avukat olarak hep buna içten içe üzülmüşümdür yani. Keşke baromuz burada olsaydı, keşke onlarda mücadele etseydi diye. Şimdi bu davada anladım ki, esasında bu doğru bir kuralmış. Doğrudan doğruya zarar gören kavramını dar yorumlamamızda abes bir şey yokmuş, çünkü olmuyor. Bir baro katılan sıfatını aldığında taraf olduğu için artık taraf olmak tehlikelidir. Biz zannediyoruz ki ihsas-ı rey sadece yargıçlar için var. Yok, herkes için ihsas-ı rey vardır. Bir söz ağzınızdan çıkıyorsa o söz sizi bağlar. Soruşturmanın başında Diyarbakır Barosu’nun o dönemki yöneticileri bu dosya ile alakalı görüşünü bir şekilde ifade ettiler. Daha iddianamede tanzim edilmemişti. O görüşe bağlılar artık. Evet, yanıldığını kabul etmek bir erdemdir. Ben çok yanıldım. Mesela dün Nahit bey benim bir yanılgımı ortaya koydu, teşekkür ediyorum kendisine. Ben yazılı savunma dilekçemde Enes’in ATK raporundaki 3-6 gün tespitini yapmışım, o minvalde gün belirtmişim ama esasında ATK raporunda, yani günler tutmuyor esasında. Orada bir gün düzeltmesi yaptı, haklı. Ben onu görmemişim. Eleştirebilir. Ben de onu eleştireceğim. Bu kadar meslektaşımın sinirlenmesine gerilmesine gerek yoktu. Ben Diyarbakır barosu kötüdür, Diyarbakır Barosu çok kıymetlidir.\n\n\nBaro’nun Talepleri ve Müşterek Faillik Tanımı ​\nŞimdi mesela dünkü iddia biçimine baktığımızda Diyarbakır Barosu, katılan olan Diyarbakır Barosu sanıkların bir takım çelişkilerini dizdi, dizdi, dizdi. O da iddia makamı gibi bir senaryo, bir oturak yapamadı. En sonunda dedi ki, tüm sanıkların cezalandırılmasını istiyorum. Evet, katılan sıfatındaki kişi bunu isteyebilir. Katılan sıfatındaki suje tüm sanıkların cezalandırılmalarını isteyebilir. İddia dokunulmazlığıdır, problem yok. Ama sıfatı taşıyan Diyarbakır Barosu ise bunun bir ağırlığı var. Diyarbakır Barosunu bu ağırlı bilerek bunu istemek zorunda. Bak daha sonrasında Diyarbakır Barosu’nun hatalı bir talebi söz konusu ise, burada bir masumun cezalandırılması söz konusu olursa siz hukuk tarihine nasıl geçeceksiniz? Ya siz güzel geçtiniz baro olarak bugüne kadar. Ben İstanbul Barosu’ndanım ama ben hep sevdim sizi. Ama siz bu davadan ötürü hukuk tarihini bir masumu cezalandırılmasına neden olan baro olarak mı geçmek istiyorsunuz? Ben bunu sizin için dahi olsa kabul etmiyorum. Amaçsal yorum ceza kanununda mümkün değil. O meslektaşıma ben bunu belirtmek istiyorum. TCK anlamında yine müşterek fail tanımlamaları. Şimdi kıymetli yargıçlarım bilirsiniz kelimeler kıymetli, önemli diyoruz sürekli. Unsur ayrı bir şey, şart ayrı bir şey, özellik ayrı bir şey. Burada müşterek faillik tanımlanmasında birlikte suç işleme kararıyla fiil üzerinde ortak hakimiyet unsurdur. Unsurdan birisi yoksa ifadenin tanımlanması mümkün değildir. Şart eksikliği tartışırız ama unsurdur. Unsur ikisi de olmak zorundadır. Keşke bu dosyada, ben de istiyorum, iki unsur da var ise eğer tüm sanıklar yönünden ispat edilebilse ama yok. Şimdi mütalaaya bakıyoruz, mütalaa Yargıtay’ın kasten öldürme suçlarında müşterek faillik tanımlanmasındaki ifadeler, ben copy-paste olduğunu düşünüyorum, sayın savcım yanlış olduğumu düşünüyorsa beni düzelsin. Belki de ben yanılmışımdır. Kopyala-yapıştır olduğunu düşünüyorum ben. İfadeler çok benziyor. Size atmış olduğum Yargıtay Genel Kurulu kararında…\n\n\nMüşterek Faillik Unsurları ve Adli Hata Örnekleri ​\nEvet güzel oldu. Şimdi, yok estağfurullah, şimdi bu müşterek faillikteki Yargıtay Ceza Genel Kurulunda olan şey birlikte suç işleme kararı. Şimdi mütalaa müşterek failliği öyle bir yorumlamış ki, ben çok korktum. Müşterek faillik yorumu çok çok zorlanan bir yorum. Çok kaygıcı bir yorum. Tabiri caizse olay yerinden geçen her kim var ise müşterek fail olacak. Bu kavramda o yüzden birlikte suç işleme kararı var. Yani aktif olarak önceden failler birlikteden aynen kasten olmak değil, öncesinde olay anında olabilir sözlü açık zımni birçok şeyi var. Birlikte bu karar alınacak, suç işleme kararı alınacak, suçtan kastımız da cinayet fiilidir, kasten öldürme suçudur. Bir ton tartışma var burada. Ceza Genel kitaplarında yaralamaya gidiyorlar ama sanık ölüyor. İşte bak burada birlikte suç işleme kararı bir sanık açısından problemli. Bunu nasıl yorumlayacağız? Demek ki, çok önemli bir kavramdır. Ortak hakimiyet ne diyor? Kanun çok açık ve net. TCK madde 37, fiil üzerinde ortak hakimiyet. Mekan üzerinde ortak hakimiyet değil. Fiil üzerinde, fiilde bu olayımızda, davamızda Narin’i boğmak fiilidir. Yani bu sanıkların bu boğmak fiilini nasıl iştirak ettiklerinin, bu birlikte suç işleme kararını nasıl aldıklarını yine fiil üzerinde bu hakimiyeti nasıl oluşturduklarının ortaya konması gerekiyor. Ben anlatımın yani mütalaanın anlatımının bu değerlendirmeyi yapmaya muktedir olmadığını düşünüyorum. Dolayısıyla müşterek faillik ile ilgili açıklamalarım bu. Şimdi sürekli bu çelişkiler bahsediliyor evet. Çelişki öneminden bahsettim. Çelişki kurumundan da bahsettim. Yine bir tane daha kitap var. Adli hatalar kitabı. Yine büyük üstad Avukat Verges. Rahmetlinin kitabı burada adli hataları anlatılıyor. Çokça adli hata var. Hatalı karar verdiğini fark edip kendi devlet yetkililerine dilekçe yazan yargıçlar da var. Kast temelli hata yapan da var, yönlendirme temelli hata yapan da var, bir ton hata var. İşte bu adli hata örneklerinde davalarından birinde Rida Dalosh denen bir karakter var.\n\n\nRida Daloş Davası ve Enes’in Durumu ​\nŞimdi burada Rida Dalosh denen bir karakter var. Yanılmıyorsam Fransa idi burası, evet Fransa. Pardon Marsilya Marsilya. Şimdi Rida Dalosh denen karakter, bunun adı kendi davasının kötü şahidi Rid yok mu? Yok mu, hayatımızda bi dahi suç olmayan, davaya dönüşmeyen bazı hayat olaylarında, insan ilişkilerinde, evimizde ailemiz ile dostumuza bazen davamızın kötü şahidi olabiliyoruz. Bazen kendimizi yanlış ifade edebiliriz, bazen bir şeyler hatırlamayabiliriz, bazen bir şeyleri unutuyor olabiliriz. Hepimiz kendi davamızın kötü şahidi olabiliriz ama Allah kimseye Enes olmayı nasip etmesin. Enes, bu şahitlik ona çok pahalıya mal oldu. Öyle pahalıya mal olmak ki, daha kız kardeşinin mezarını göremedi ve adı bundan unutulması zor bir addır büyük ihtimalle yarın öbür gün de ismini değiştirmek zorunda kalacak. Şimdi bu Rida Dalosh, cinayet günü için yanlış olduğu ortaya çıkan başka bir yerde olduğu sanması ortaya çıkarmış, yani cinayet A yerinde işlenmiş ama Rida B yerindeyim demiş. Sonradan Rida’nın A yerinde olduğu anlaşılmış. Hakimler soruşturma ve kovuşturma sürecinde yalan söylediği için doğal olarak suçlu olduğu sonucuna ulaşmıştır. Hiç kimse Dalosh’un bağımlığının bu zihin bulanıklarını açıklayabilip açıklayamayacağı ile alakalı soruyu soracak temel sağ görüye sahip değildi. Sağ görü bu davada gerçekten çok önemli. Niye bu insanlara iyi olma hakkı vermiyorsunuz? Niye iyi olamazlar mı? Bir detay var. Önemli bir detay. Enes o gün ne diyor? Bakkala gittiğim zaman diyor, köyün delisine enerji içeceği aldım. Hoş bir çocuk Enes ha. Normal hayatında çok seversiniz. Köyün delisine kendi cebinden para çıkartıp enerji içeceği alan bir çocuktan bahsediyoruz. Biraz sağ görü ile bakarsanız bu çocuktaki iyi yanları göreceksiniz. Ha bu arada çok özür diliyorum, burada bu cümleye ara veriyorum. Bir tane video kaydı, o çok önemli. Okul önünde çekilen bir video. Olay günü Enes’i gösteriyor. Çok karanlık bir yer. Evet şimdi bakın. Yorgunluktan, üzüntüden bitmiş, tükenmiş, bitap yere düşüyor bu çocuk. Ya ben böyle kaç tane cinayet faili tanıyorsunuz? Ya hem cinayet fiilini işleyecek, hem cinayet fiilini iştirak edecek hem de her yerde kız kardeşini arayacak. Şizofren mi bu çocuk? Ya da çok profesyonel bir katil mi? Buna akıl sır erdirebilmek mümkün mü? Bak şimdi buna da tiyatro mu diyecekler? Buna da dram eğitimi mi diyecekler? Beni tanımıyordu o zaman. Ben ona o eğitimi vermedim. Bak bu kadar. Bu video bu kadar. Şimdi dolayısıyla buradaki Dalosh denen karakter, cinayet, evet cinayet günü nerede olduğu yönünde yalan söylemişti bağımlılığından ötürü. Şimdi diyor ki buradaki kitapta, hakimler diyor kendilerini mazur göstermek için de kapatıldığı tarih tam olarak onlara söylemediğini ileri sürdüler. Halbuki araştırmaları gerekiyor diyor. Kitapta bu ihtimal bir bağımlının blackout adı ile bilinen, hafıza boşlukları olabileceği ve bulunduğu ne yeri ve zamanı bilmeyeceği, ölçüde ağırdır. Çünkü yalan addedilenler onun şahsında yalan değildi. Hayatın olağan akışından bahsediliyor. Katılan taraf meslektaşlarımız üç ya da dört defa hayatın olağan akışı dedi. Evet biz avukatlar hayatın olağan akışı kavramanı çok kullanırız. Mahkemede de görürüz kararlarda.\n\n\nTravmanın Etkisi ve Yargılamaya Son Çağrı ​\nŞimdi yine kıymetli yargıçlar 21 Ağustos 2024 tarihinden sonra özellikle Narin’in annesi, babası ve kardeşinden oluşan gerçek ailesi budur. Hepsi aile. Aile. Hepsi seviyor ama bizim hukuken anladığımız tanımla söylüyorum, aile anne babadan oluşan birlik ki yine köyün geri kalanları için de keza öyle. Artık hayat olağan akmıyor. Hala bile, hiçbir şey olağan akmıyor. Dolayısıyla olağan hayatta meydana gelebilecek mantık silsilelerini biz bu davada uygulayamayız. Hele hele Enes için hiç uygulayamayız. Olağan mıdır? Enes’in o saatlere kadar arama yapması, yorulması bitip yere düşmesi olağan değil. Dolayasıyla hayatın olağan akışı kavramı bu davada o şekilde yorumlanamaz. O gün hayat olağan akmıyor. Hala bile akmıyor, akamayacak artık. Bir zahmet akmasın yani. Küçük bir kız o köyde öldü. Akmasın hayat. Olağan akmadığı için bu travmanın yani bir psikoloğa, herhangi bir psikoloğa soralım; bunun ne denli bir travma olduğunu bize söyleyecektir. Bu koca bir travmadır. O travmadan sonra da o insanın normal olması, normal ifade etmesi, normal davranması mümkün değil. Dolayısıyla müvekkil Enes’in davranışları bu minvalde değerlendirilmelidir. Yine o günden sonra basın mensupları her gün köydeler idi. Türkiye bu davaya sahip çıktı, kıymet verdi, takip etti. Her gün köy ahali kamera görüyor her yerde. Bu da olağan değil. Kameralar var, sunucular var, devlet yetkilileri geldi, milletvekilleri geldi. Orada da bir olağan dışlılık, o olağan dışlılığa nazaran davranışlar da olağan olmayabilir. Benim karşıma bir kamera çıkartsanız benim normal davranmamı bekleyemezsiniz. Dolayısıyla Enes’in davranışları anlamında bu blackout kavramı ile beraber ondan da bahsetmiş olayım. Müşterek faillikten bahsettim, mekan mekan evet müşterek faillikte mekan kavramı da burada allak bullak. Mekan nedir? Biz mekandan ne anlıyoruz? Suç işlenilen yer. Bizim hukuken mekan diyeceğimiz yer ama şimdi bu o kadar küçük bir köy ki aslında fotoğrafını gördük. Yani mekan tepe mi? Yani mekan ahır önü mü? Mekan yamaç mı? Mekan ev mi? Mekan patika mı? Bu belirgin değil. Bu belirginliği sağlayamadığımız durumda da yine müşterek failliğe ilişkin ithamlar yapmamız ve tanımları yapmamız çok zorlaşıyor. Bitireceğim, toparlayacağım. Çok yordum herkesi. Sonuç olarak geçen celse Karamozov kardeşler kitabını gösterdim. Ben de bayağı laf yedim, iyi ki de gösterdim. Ama çok güzel bir kitap. Karamozov kardeşler’de Dostoyevski 1200 sayfa falan olması lazım. ilk 1020 sayfa okuyucuya öyle bir katil çıkartıyor ki; diyorsun ki, katil budur. Aklını kullanıyorsun, herkes kendini zeki kabul ediyor. Her insan zekidir, buna da layıktır ama kitabın son sayfalarında sürpriz! Yazar sürpriz yapıyor. Katil bambaşka biri çıkıyor. Dolayısıyla demek ki, aklımıza güvenirken de bin defa düşünmemiz gerekiyor çünkü aklımızdır, yanılabiliriz, yanıltılabiliriz. Yanlış yönlendirilmiş olabiliriz. Manipülasyona maruz kalabiliriz. Kolluğun, savcılığın manipüle ettiği gibi, ettiler yani, bunu anlayacaklar ilerleyen süreçte. Şimdi son sözlerim de şu; kıymetli yargıçlar, yargı sistemimizde cumhuriyetimizin kazanımları olan bu kanunlar bir vaka, bir olay yargılamaya dönüştüğü zaman karar verme davranışlarımızın nasıl olabileceğini, hüküm çeşitlerini ayrıntılı olarak belirtmiştir. Sizden talebim yasalarımıza bu anlamda yasalarımızın bu ilgili maddelerine uymanızı sizden talep ediyorum. Gerçekten büyük bir risktir. Ağırdır yani. Ya masumsa sorusunu gece kafanızı yastığa koyduğunuz zaman sorma ağırlığına gerçekten girmenize gerek yok, kimse sizi bundan dolayı kınayamaz bir laf bile söyleyemez. Gelsinler onlar otursunlar. Madem bu kadar kendilerine güveniyorlar, gelsin otursunlar, onlar karar versinler. Kolay değil zordur. Yasanın bu zorluktan nasıl çıkacağınızı yasa göstermiştir. Dediğim gibi yine suçlu suç işlenmesinin önlenmesi, toplum menfaati, genel güvenlik, genel ahlakı yargılamanın amacı değil, içişleri bakanlığı ilgilensin, bizi ilgilendirmiyor. O içişleri bakanlığının sorunu. Dolayısıyla bu anlamda o amaçlardan azade maddi gerçeğe ulaşma amacını yasaya uygun bir şekilde hüküm kurmanızı talep ediyorum. Son olarak, belirttiğim gibi ilk darbeyi Enes Narin öldüğü zaman yedi. İkinci darbeyi iddianame ile yedi. Sizden saygılarım ile talep ediyorum. Öldürücü darbeyi siz vurmayın, teşekkür ediyorum.",

    "text": "Av. Adnan Ataş ​\n\nKamera Görüntülerinin İncelenmesi ve Sorumluluk ​\nAslında sayın başkan, tüm dosyaya baktığınız zaman, şöyle başlamak istiyorum cümleye, Tavşantepe köyünün sahibi, Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın avukatı diyesi geliyor insanın, tüm dosyaya baktığımızda, biraz sonra sebeplerini ayrıntılı olarak izah edeceğiz; öncelikle müvekkil ile ilgili, bizden önceki savunmada müvekkil ile ilgili ithamlar olduğu için sadece cevaplamamız gerekiyor. İddianamede yok, ancak müvekkil ile ilgili bu iddialara cevap vermemiz gerekiyor. Sadece müvekkil ile ilgili ithamlar yoktu, DARAN-2 görüntüleri 19 gün sonra incelendi dediler bizden önce. Sayın başkan DARAN görüntüleri 19 gün sonra incelenmedi, DARAN görüntülerinin 28-29 Ağustos tarihlerinde incelendiğine dair dosya içerisinde tutanaklar var. Sadece DARAN-2 kamerası değil, aynı zamanda kırmızı arabayı gören çiftlik kamerası da 28-29 Ağustos’ta incelendi. Yalnız incelenme saatleri sayın başkan, saat çiftlik kamerası saat 17:00’dan sonra, DARAN-2 görüntüleri ise 18:00’dan sonra incelendi. Bu kameraların 28-29 Ağustos tarihlerinde incelenmesine rağmen müvekkil dahil sanıkların tespit edilememesinin sebebi müvekkil değil, Güran ailesidir. Kameralarda bu saatlere bakılmasının sebebi müvekkil değil, dediğim gibi Güran ailesidir. Sayın başkan, müvekkil ile ilgili az önce.. Bu şekilde ses gelmiyor sayın başkan.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’a Yönelik Asılsız İddialar ​\nTamam. Şimdi sayın başkan, ikinci husus, bir istismardan bahsedildi. Yine bizden önceki savunmada biz şunu gördük. Soruşturma boyunca Güran ailesinin, Güran ailesi diyorum lütfen kişi ve hedef göstermiyorum, tek tek isim saymak istemiyorum, yaklaşık 39 tane tanık dinlendi bu dosyada. 25’e yakını Güran ailesinden sayın başkan. Baba dahil hiç kimse müvekkili şüpheli olarak göstermedi. Birinci husus bu. İkinci husus 8 Eylül’den sonraki tarihte öncelikle bir 50 bin liralık ya da 40 bin liralık alacak verecek meselesi ileri sürüldü. Bu iddia tutmadı sayın başkan. Kimse inanmadı, bizde inanmadık. Akabinde Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın yengesi ile ilişkisi var iddiası ortaya atıldı. Biz kullanılan telefonun Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın yengesine ait olmadığını belirterek bu iddiayı da çürüttük ve nihayetinde müvekkil ile ilgili hoş olmayan, dayanağı olmayan iğrenç iftira diyeceğim, pedofili ya da sapıklık iddiası dile getirildi. Hiçbir iddiası yok sayın başkan. Hiçbir dayanağı olmayan bir iddia. Az önce meslektaşımız Ali bey bir şeyi dile getirdi. Yani örnek veriyorum, biz bu dosyada Enes Güran’dan bahsediyorsak Enes Güran ile ilgili bir iddiadan bahsediyorsak, onun ile ilgili bir jandarma tutanağımız var. Annesi diyor ki, erkek çocuklarım evdeyken ben kızımı Maşallah’a bırakıyorum diyor. Meslektaşımızın da dediği gibi herkes bu tutanağa bir anlam yükleyebilir veya annenin bu cümlesi bir anlam yüklenebilir. Biz bir iddiada bulunurken sayın başkan, öncelikle onu belirtmek istiyorum, dosya içerisindeki tutanaklardan hareket ediyoruz. Dolayasıyla hiçbir dayanağı olmayan, hiçbir delil ile desteklenmeyen bu iddiayı kabul etmiyoruz. Hatta iğrenç bir iddia olarak suçluyoruz. Yine bilinen, köyde dinlenen insan sayısı soruşturma aşamasında sayın başkan, söylemeye gerek yok, müvekkil ile ilgili bu yönde tek bir tespit, tek bir şüphe dahi yok. Bu iddiayı hiçbir şekilde kabul etmiyoruz. Bizden önceki savunmada, Narin cümlesi şöyle geçti. Olay yeri olarak evinin içiymiş gibi dile getirildi. Sayın başkan müvekkilin olay yerine dair bir bilgisi yok. Olay yeri ile ilgili bizim, yani müvekkilimizin somut, bugüne kadar tek bir beyanı yok.\n\n\nMüvekkilin İfade Tutarlılığı ve Güran Ailesi Çelişkileri ​\nMüvekkil zaten son ve istikrarlı beyanında ailesini güvende hissettikten sonra tüm beyanlarında aynı şeyi dile getirdi. Gittiğinde Narin kızımız odada yerdeydi ve ağzından köpük geliyordu. Olay yerini hiçbir zaman tariflemedi. Yine bugünkü savunma, bizden önceki savunma bize yine bir şey gösteriyor sayın başkan. Savunmada şunu duyduk. Enes Güran kardeşi Narin Güran’a bir zarar verirse Salim Güran neden babasını aramasın? Neden babasını arayıp da oğlun kızına böyle bir şey yaptı, neredesin, gel demesin? gibi bir ibare kullanıldı. Narin’in kaybolduğu gün sayın başkan, biz dosya içerisinde biliyoruz ki Arif Güran kızın kaybını, kendi kızının kaybını ailesinden öğrenmedi. Komşusundan ilk önce, kendi beyanına göre söylüyorum, kendi komşusundan daha sonra ise sayın başkan, yan köydeki birinden öğrendiğini söylüyor. Salim Güran, Narin’in kaybolduğu gün tüm aile üyesi ile görüşüyor, demeyeceğim bir çok aile üyesi ile görüşüyor ama babayı aramıyor. Enes Narin’e bir şey yaptığında babayı araması gereken Salim, Narin kaybolduğunda babayı aramıyor. Bu durum zaten Salim Güran’ın aslında bir şekilde babadan uzak durmak istediğini, bize açıkça gösteriyor. Şu ana kadar sayın başkan söylediklerim bizden önceki iddialar ve ben bunlara kısmen de olsa cevap vermek zorundayım çünkü bu son sözümüz. Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın ifade değişikliklerinden bahsedildi. Sayın başkan, Nevzat Bahtiyar bugün konuştu. En rahat konuştuğu bugündü ve dündü. Mahkemenizin takdirinde olan bir durum. Bu duruşmadan sonra 7 Kasım’da duruşmadan bir hafta sonra ailesine koruma veriliyor. En net haliyle o gün kendisine, ailesi kendisine güvence istedi ve müvekkilimin de o tarihten sonra kısmen de olsa kafası, en azından ailesi yönünden rahattı. O tarihten bu yana hiçbir şekilde ifadesi değişmedi. Eğer ifade değişikliği bir şey gösteriyorsa sayın başkan biz Güran ailesinin tüm üyelerinin bu süreçte yaptığı ifade değişikliğini çok iyi gördük. Az önce dedim ya, Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın, köyün sahibi Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın avukatıyım demek istiyorum, diye dosyada ki soy isimleri kapattığımızda sayın başkan, Nevzat’ın soyadını Güran zannedersiniz. Tüm olanlar sanki Nevzat’ı korumak için, ama değil.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Durumu ve Soğukkanlılık İddiası ​\nBiz şunu çok iyi biliyoruz ki müvekkil Nevzat Bahtiyar Salim’in yakın arkadaşı, Salim’in dostu ve düğün davetiyesi için aile üyelerinin köyde olmadığı bir gün Salim Güran’ın arayıp da suça ortak ettiği, köyün gerçekten garibanı. Bir husus var sayın başkan. Müvekkil ile ilgili hep soğukkanlı, soğukkanlı, soğukkanlı ibaresi var. Biliyorsunuz, gerek sizin de kullandığınız bir beyanı, sayın başkan, bugün müvekkilin ailesi burada değil, burada olmamasının iki sebebi var. Birincisi, evet güvenlik gerekçesiyle ikincisi biz avukatların ben ve Ali Bey’in çabası. Onlar da duruşmaya gelmek istediler. Biz gerek görmedik. Bizzat Nevzat beyin yanında olduğumuzu söyledik. Müvekkilin ailesi de bugün yanında olmak istedi ama dediğimiz gibi biz sadece müvekkili değil, burada çok fazla insan buradaki insanların güvenliği için duruşma düzeninde bir sorun yaşanmaması için biz ailenin gelmesini uygun görmedik. Sizinle de aynı görüşte olduğumuzu düşünüyorum. Müvekkil, sayın başkan, ilk duruşma da da aynı şeyi yaşadı. İlk duruşmada da yalnızdı. Sadece yalnız olmanın dışında hakaretlere ve tehditlere maruz kaldı. Biz duruşmada Güran ailesi üyelerinin müvekkilimize yaptığı baskıyı gördük. Yani annenin bir kaç kez söylediği “Allah belanı versin” cümlesini bir kaç kez gördük. Burada, sayın başkan, bir insan kendisini güvende hissetmezse, bir insan çaresizlik içeresinde hissederse kendini ki, duruşmada biliyorsunuz kendi tuttuğu özel müdafisi de yoktu. Diğer CMK müdafini eleştirmiyorum zaten onunla ilgili hepimiz gerçeği biliyoruz. Gerçek derken kötü bir şey yok ama o sürecin nasıl olduğunu biliyoruz. Müvekkilimiz dolayısıyla kendini yalnız ve çaresizlik içerisinde hissetti. Bunun kendisinde yarattığı ruh hali ile, evet bir ne yazık ki, duruşmada bir tavır sergiledi. Kendi içine kapandı, sustu ve soğukkanlı gözüktü. Bu soğukkanlı gözükmesi hiçbir şekilde sizde veya kamuoyunda izlenime sebep olmasın, dediğim gibi yalnız kaldı. Yani duruşmada, takdir edeceğiniz üzere, bazen kendisine sözler söylendi. Yeri geldi ağır cümleler kullanıldı.\n\n\nCinayet Gerekçesi Eksikliği ve Tanıklardaki Çelişkiler ​\nAilesi yanında değil, avukatı yanında değil ve bu ruh haliyle, içerisinde bulunduğu durum sebebiyle bu soğukkanlı duruşun aslında bu soğukkanlı duruş değil, dediğimiz gibi bu yani insanın psikolojisinin geliştirdiği bir savunma diyelim buna. Sayın başkan bir kronolojisi olur, en başta cinayet için bir gerekçe olması gerekiyor. Biz bu güne kadar cinayet ilgili müvekkilim açısından dosya içerisinde ne iddia makamı tarafından, ne katılanlar tarafından, ne sanıklar tarafından ortaya konulmuş ciddi bir gerekçe göremedik. Az önce ifade ettiğim üzere ne para konusu, ne yengesiyle olan ilişki konusu ne de bugün ki iğrenç iddia cinayet için bir gerekçe değil. Sayın başkan, soruşturma aşamasında Yasemin Gül’ün kullandığı bir cümle var. Yüksel Güran kardeşi der ki bizim Güran’ların çocuklarına Güran’lar dışında kimse karışamaz, varsa bir olay köyün içerisinde ailenin içerisindedir der ve bu çok net bir cümle. O köyde Güran’ların çocukları dışında Güran’lara dokunabilecek biri yok. Bu ailenin kendi kabulü, ailenin kendi beyanı. Yüksel Güran bu ifadesi ile aslında müvekkilimi cinayet şüphelisi olmaktan çok rahat çıkarmaktadır. Sayın başkan, tüm çelişkilere tek tek değinmeyeceğim, bazılarını dile getirmem gerekiyor. Birsen Güran’ın ifadesini izah ettiler. Dün Nahit bey de izah etti, detaylı olarak anlattı bunu. Birsen Güran 17:40 diyor ve beyanını da bir telefon görüşmesi ile destekliyor. Ama telefon görüşmesi de yalan çıkıyor.\n\n\nİfadelerdeki Çelişkiler ve Aile Üyelerinin Rolü ​\nSayın başkan dün Nahit bey, dosya içerisinde HTS kayıtları belli, Birsen Güran ben işte 17:40 halamla görüştüm, ben saate baktım, bu sebeple 17:40 dedim. Ama 17:40 değil, 14:00 imiş denildi. 14:00’da da görüşmesi yok halasıyla. Dolayısıyla Birsen Güran’ın ifadesi bu dosya açısından çok çok somut bir delildir. Sadece bir beyan değildir, bir beyandan fazlasıdır. Salim Güran kendisine saati 17:40 olarak söyle şeklindeki bu beyan müdafi huzurunda alınmış bir beyandır. Bu beyana itibar edilmeli sayın başkanım. Hediye Güran saat 13:00 ve 13:40 olmak üzere iki kez olay yerine gittiğini söylüyor. Diyeceğim, olay yeri Arif Güran ve evin çevresi olduğu için oğlu Abdurrahman Güran uyandığında saat 13:00’dan 17:00’a kadar annesini evde görmediğini söylüyor. Sayın başkan dün katılan tarafın, tabi katılan taraf diyoruz, sayın başkan bu dosya öyle bir dosya ki normal şartlarda biz mütalaaya karşı savunma yapıyoruz ama bugün hem savunmaya hem mütalaaya, hem de diğer sanıklara karşı bir savunma geliştirmek zorundayız. Dün katılan tarafı bu durumu çok net izah etti. Hediye Güran da aslında bir tanık. Yani bir şekilde Hediye Güran bu kişilerin, işte olay dışına çıkarılması için hazırlanmış bir tanık. Biz de bu konuda katılan taraf ile aynı düşüncedeyiz. Sayın başkan, Enes Güran’ın ifadeleri çok çelişkili. Bir insanın hayatında önemli günler vardır, bu önemli günleri unutamayız. O önemli günlerin detaylarını aklımızdan çıkaramayız. Tek tek ifadelerin tarihlerini söylememe gerek yok, tüm ifadeler dosya içerisinde mevcut. Jandarmanın yaptığı mülakatta 14:45 ile 17:30 arasındaki eylemlerinden bahsederken hiç uyumaktan bahsetmiyor, hiç. Saatlerde yanılmış olabilir diyelim, hiç uyumaktan bahsetmiyor sayın başkan. Ama sonraki günlerde yine ben o saatlerde uyuyordum diyerek yeni bir savunma, yeni bir argüman, yeni bir çelişki ortaya doğurdu. Salim Güran’ın Mehmet Selim Atasoy ve Ramazan Atasoy ile çelişen ifadelerini zaten hepimiz biliyoruz. Dün de Ramazan Atasoy dinlendi. O çelişkiler yine giderilmedi. Ramazan Atasoy hala söylediği saatlerde ısrarcı. Kanaatimiz, Birsen Güran’ın yönlendirildiği gibi onun da yönlendirildiğidir. Bir de eşarp detayı var sayın başkan. Çok fazla dile getirildiği için tekrar etmemize gerek yok, annenin eşarp balkonda demirlerdeydi ya da balkon parmaklıklarındaydı ibaresi bir kez dile getirilmiyor bu sayın başkan. Aile tarafından birçok kez dile getiriliyor. Ömer Güran, Salim Güran’ın kardeşi bir yayında hatta Ferit Demir ile yaptığı bir röportajda Narin’in nereden geldiğini ve nereye gittiğini gösteriyor. Nereye gittiğini anlatıyor. Sayın başkan çok detaylı anlatıyor, neden eve gittikten sonra kameraya takılmadı diye sorulduğunda kendisine işte patikadan geldi ama giderken bu tarafı kullandığı için kameraya takılmadığını söylüyor. Bize olay yerini, ailenin içerisini gösteriyor. Sayın başkan, bir kırmızı araba olayı var. Az önce meslektaşımız ses kaydı dinletti. Ses kaydında dikkatimi çeken bir şey oldu. Arka tarafta biri ile görüşüyor.\n\n\nSalim Güran’ın Yönlendirme Çabaları ve Kırmızı Araba İddiası ​\nSalim Güran görüşmede şimdi savunmaları o dur ki çevreden edindiği bilgiyi jandarmaya aktardı. Dinlettikleri ses kaydı, sayın başkan, saat 22:40’dan sonra ya da 22:30’dan sonraki ses kaydı. jandarmanın aradığı ilk ses kaydı değil. Jandarmanın ilk aranması saat 20:18’de Salim Güran’ın jandarmayı aradığında doğrudan iki çingene ve bir kırmızı araçtan bahsediyor. Fadile Bahtiyar’ın ifadesi var. sayın başkan bu ses kaydı Salim Güran’ın iki çingene ve bir araçtan bahsettiği ses kaydı, siz de belki takip ediyorsunuz, son dönemler medyaya düştü. Yeni, yani kamuoyunun yeni bildiği bir delil ama Fadile Bahtiyar’ın Nahit bey iyi takip ediyordur sayın başkan.\n\n\nDelil Karartma, Yönlendirme ve Olay Yeri Bulguları ​\nBen biliyorum sayın başkan. Ben takip ediyorum. Son 1 ay içerisinde düştü sosyal medyaya bu ses kaydı. Şimdi Salim Güran’ın iki çingene ve bir kırmızı arabadan bahsettiği ses kaydı, bir bir buçuk ay önce sosyal medyaya düştü. Müvekkil kızı Fadile Bahtiyar 16 Eylül tarihli ifadesinde diyor ki “Ben Salim Güran ve Mehmet Selim Atasoy’u yan yana gördüm”. Salim Güran bu ilk tarladan gelip de meydanda toplandıkları andan bahsediyor. Saat, jandarmanın arandığı saat 20:18’den bahsediyor ve Salim Güran’ın yanındaki Mehmet Selim Atasoy’a yani fısıldayarak bir kırmızı araba ve 2 çingeneden bahsedeceğim diyor. Jandarmayı arayıp bunu yapıyor. Bu iddia makamının da dediği gibi iki sebeple olabilir. Birincisi Nevzat’ı işaret etmesi, ikincisi yönlendirme yapması. Meslektaşımızın dinlettiği ses kaydında sayın başkan, dediğim gibi 22:30’dan sonraki bir ses kaydı o, ilk ses kaydı değil. Dolayısıyla başkasından duydum ya da başkasından duyduğunu aktardığı şeklindeki savunmayı doğrulamıyor. Ama ses kaydında dikkatimi çeken bir şey daha oldu. Salim Güran biri ile konuşuyor. Karşısında kayıp ile ilgili soru sorduğunda Salim Güran kırmızı bir araba, iki çingeneden bahsediyor ve öyle değil mi Mehmet Selim diye soruyor. Yine yanında Mehmet Selim Atasoy var. Doğrulattığı kişi ya da başkasından duyduğu kişi de Mehmet Selim Atasoy. Bu da zaten dosyadaki delillere baktığımızda Mehmet Selim Atasoy ve Ramazan Atasoy’un beyanlarına baktığımız zaman ne olduğunu aslında bize gayet iyi gösteriyor. Salim Güran, Birsen, Hediye ve diğer aile üyelerinden sonra Mehmet Selim Atasoy ve Ramazan Atasoy’a da müdahale etmiş gözüküyor. Yönlendirme açısından söylüyorum. Jandarmanın yönlendirilmesi. Ali bey anlattı, tekrar uzun uzun anlatmama gerek yok ama bir şeyi dile getirmedi. Arif Güran’ın iddialarını dile getirmedi. Dosya içerisinde yer alan mülakat Arif Güran ile yapılan mülakat tutanağı, o tutanakta Arif Güran kendi ailesinin jandarmayı yönlendirmesinden bahsediyor sayın başkan. Bakın, sadece jandarmanın dikkatini çeken bir husus değil bu, katılan Arif Güran’ın dahi dikkatini çeken bir detay. Peki tüm bunlar, tüm delil karartmalar, tüm bu çelişkiler, tüm bu yönlendirmeler artık Nevzat Güran diyeceğim sayın başkan, Nevzat Bahtiyar için mi yapıldı? Mümkün değil. Dün Nahit bey aslında uzun uzun değindi. Çok uzun bir savunma yaptığı için sadece benim değil, bir çok meslektaşımızın yaptığı savunmalarda tekrara girmiş olacağız. Enes’in vücudundaki izler, hep gözündeki morluk, kolundaki ısırık konuşuldu. Ama sayın başkan sırtında izler var, ama sayın başkan göğüs tarafında izler var. Nahit Bey’in de dediği gibi 8-9 yerinde ekimozlar var. Evet hepsi net tespit edilememiş ama 8-9 izden bahsediyoruz sayın başkan. Bu bir kargaşanın ya da bir müdahalenin ya da bir kavganın neticesinde olabilecek bir şey. Sadece bir mısır koçanı ile olabilecek bir şey değil. Enes’in gözündeki morlukları neye bağlayabiliriz sayın başkan? Narin’in üzerinden alınan 91 sürüntüye, 91 sürüntünün bir çoğunda kan pozitif. Ahırda toprak alanda kan pozitif, ahırın yanındaki kayalıkta kan var. Evde balkonun o girişindeki orada kan var. Sayın başkan Arif Güran’ın ev ve çevresinde bir şey olduğu kesin. İddia makamı mütalaasında Narin’in yokuşu yukarı çıktığını kabul ediyor. Mütalaaya bu yönde sadece bu yönü ile bizde katılıyoruz. Her ne olduysa, sayın başkan, o yokuşun yukarısında oldu. Zaten Ulusal Kriminal Büro’nun raporu da bunu destekliyor. Sayın başkan, Salim Güran’ın aracında bulunan DNA, Salim Güran’a dün aynı soruyu ben de sordum, ifadelerinde şöyle bir cümle var. Aracımıza bindi mi ya da soruşturma aşamasında kullandığı kelimeyi söylüyorum; ben araca bindiğini görmedim. Sayın başkan soruşturma dosyasında çocukların dahi ifadesi alındı, biliyorsunuz. Video kayıtları incelendi. Okul kamerası, Ruhi Kaya’nın kamerası bir sürü çocukların ifadesi var. Biz hiçbir çocuğu arabada oyun oynarken görmedik. Sayın başkan tüm köyün çocukları okul ve civarında, çiçekler ile okulun bahçesinde oyun oynuyor. Biz bunu gördük ama sayın başkan çocukların arabada oyun oynadığını görmedik. Hepimiz babayız, hepimiz biliyoruz. Biz arabayı ilk aldığımız anda belki kendi çocuğumuz 1-2 gün merak eder, oynar ama üçüncü günden sonra araba çocukların oyun alanı değildir. Arif Güran’ın aracının şoför koltuğunda bulunan DNA bu nedenle çok önemli bir delildir. Salim Güran’ın. Özür dilerim, Arif Güran dedim. Yine cenazenin üzerinde bulunan üç taş konusu ve Nahit Eren’in de iddia ettiği üzere gibi PSA’lar ile ilgili açıklama. Acaba oraya sadece müvekkilden sonra üç taş, bir taş iken iki taştan fazlası yani oraya etek mi bırakıldı? O çantaya başka eşyalar mı konuldu? Müvekkil bir çok şeyi samimi olarak izah etti ama kanca yok sayın başkan. O kanca bile daha sonra gitmiş olabilir sayın başkan. Daha sonra gittiğini düşünüyoruz. Bu da müvekkilimden sonra katilin artık veya katillerin diyeyim, olay yerine hani pardon cenazenin bulunduğu yere gittiği ve cenazeyi gizlemek adına daha fazla bir çaba içerisine girdiğini gösteriyor. Salim Güran’ın bir ses kaydı var. Az önce onu atladım sayın başkan. Çelişkilerden ya da yönlendirmeden bahsederken ses kaydında insanlar mısır tarlasına bakalım mı, mısır tarlasında da arayalım mı? diye sorduklarında ya varsa kanaldadır, mısır tarlasında ne işi var kızın? orada bataklıkta arama yapmayın gibi cümlesi var. Tam cümleyi hatırlamıyorum ama bataklık kelimesinin geçtiğini biliyorum. Mısır tarlasının geçtiğini biliyorum. Mısır tarlasında Eğertutmaz deresinin civarı da bataklık sayın başkan. O tarafa gitmek isteyen insanlar olduğu zaman ne işiniz var sizin orada? Narin oraya gitmiş olamaz, gelin kanala bakalım. Ha gitmek isterseniz siz biliyorsunuz ama insanları kanala yönlendiriyor sayın başkan. Bu da dosyadaki en önemli delillerden bir tanesidir. Jandarmanın istihbari tutanaklarına baktığımız zaman bir çok tutanakta sayın başkan, hatta şöyle bir tutanak var, çok kısa 2-3 satırlık, Arif Güran’ın ahırında cenazeye bulabilirsiniz diye. Hatta Arif Güran’ın da işin içerisinde olduğuna dair bir şey var, bir istihbari bilgi var. JASAT’ın tuttuğu tutanak ve soruşturma dosyası içerisinde mevcut. Sayın başkan bunların hepsi bir tesadüf olamaz, bulunan kanlar gelen istihbari bilgiler, Salim Güran’ın aracında çıkan DNA, Enes Güran’ın gözündeki morluk, vücudundaki 8-9 ekimoz, ayrı ayrı bölgelerdeki, bunların hepsi bize şunu gösteriyor. Her ne olduysa, sayın başkan, ahır ve Arif Güran’ın evi civarında oldu. Mitokondriyal DNA meselesi. Şöyle bir detay var orada sayın başkan. Bu DNA Narin’e ait, anneye ve Enes’e ait olabilir ama sayın başkan oradaki saçların boyutu farklı. Kısa saçlar da var, uzun saçlarda var. Dolayısıyla her yani orada elde edilen bütün saçların ve kılların Narin’e ait olma ihtimali var. Evet DNA olarak mümkün, boy ölçülerine baktığımız zaman biri 16 cm biri 29 cm sayın başkan. Her iki saç ve kıl örneğinin aynı anda Narin’e ait olma ihtimali yok. Boyutları farklı, dolayısıyla biz o DNA’nın aslında, Narin bir çok kişinin kullandığı bir cümle, Narin katilini avucunda sakladı ve bize göstermek istedi. Tekrar ediyorum sayın başkan. Ben DNA’yla yola çıkarak oradaki DNA annenindir, Enes’indir demiyorum. Narin’in de olabilir bu kabul ancak yani Narin’in üzerinde bulunan saç ve kılların boyutları farklı. Hepsi Narin’e ait olamaz sayın başkan. Dolayasıyla ben o DNA’ların bizi katile götüreceğini düşünüyorum. Nihai kararı tabii ki siz vereceksiniz. Evden alınan 37 halı dün, Nahit Eren’in de belirttiği gibi, Nahit başkanımızın da belirttiği gibi, sadece iki adet DNA bulunuyor. Ben tabii ki bu anormal bir durum. Yani bir evde, insanların yaşadığı, gazetecilerin gelip gittiği, habercilerin, jandarmanın, polisin. Sadece iki DNA tespit edilebiliyor. Zaten bu başlı başına anormal bir durum ama ben buradan yola çıkarak Yüksel Güran’ın ifadesine baktığımızda sayın başkan, Yüksel Güran bir çok ifadesinde Hediye Güran gittikten sonra balkonu yıkadığını söylüyor. Belki sadece balkonu yıkamadı, halıları da yıkadı. Belki olay mahallini temizledi. Ben ifadesindeki o cümlenin de farkında olmadan bizi gerçeğe götüreceğini düşünüyorum. Sayın başkan kusura bakmayın, dosyayı biliyorsunuz. Bazen notlarımızı hatırlamıyoruz yoksa o.. “Tüm bu hususlar nazara alınarak” diyeceğim ama az kaldı sayın başkan.\n\n\nCinayet Mahallinin Tespiti ve Ailenin Köydeki Gücü ​\nSayın başkan, tüm bu anlattıklarım bize bir şeyi gösteriyor. Cinayet mahalli belli. Narin o yokuşu çıktı, her ne yaşandı ise orada yaşandı. Her ne yaşandı ise aile içerisinde yaşandı. Arif Güran, ilk defa savunma yapıyorum, başın sağ olsun, buradan dile getireyim, burada mı değil mi bilmiyorum. Bir baba için çok zor. Dün savunmasında bir anne çocuğuna bunu yapar mı dedi. Üzülerek söylüyorum ki, ne yazık ki, biz evet, biz çocuğunu öldüren anne de gördük. Biz kardeşini öldüren ağabey de gördük. Yani kendisine de Allah sabır versin diyorum. Başka da sadece anlıyorum kendisini, öyle söyleyeyim. Müvekkil ile ilgili sayın başkan şu ana kadar hep olay yerinde delillerden ve şeyden bahsettik, deliller bizi nereye götürüyor. Ben size bunu izah etmeye çalıştım müvekkil ile ilgili. Sayın başkan işte buradayız. Bir sanık orada, diğer üç sanık orada. Nasıl bir iştirakten bahsedebiliriz sayın başkan? Yani bu dört insanın bir arada birlikte hareket etmesi, karar vermesi mümkün değil. Salim ile Nevzat hareket etse Yüksel hanım dışarıda kalıyor, Salim ile Enes hareket etse Nevzat dışarıda kalıyor. Bir şekilde müvekkilim bu dört kişi ile birlikte aynı anda, aynı ortamda bulunması, birlikte bir şeye karar vermesi mümkün değil. Neden kabul etti? Neden eksik anlattı? Cenazeyi kabul etti? Neden eksik anlattı, hususlarına geleceğim sayın başkan. Biz çoban Ahmet’in videosunu izledik dün burada. Çoban Ahmet’i gördük hepimiz. Kürtçe de anlaşamayabiliriz, duyduğumuz belli başlı şeyler var. Hepimiz Enes kelimesini duymamıza rağmen çoban kabul etmedi. Erhan Güran da kabul etmedi. Hepimiz savcılığa şikayet cümlesini duyarken savcılığa gitmeyeceksin, bir şey anlatmayacaksın, neyse o tam. Cümle işte çoban bunu kabul etmedi. Erhan Güran da bunu kabul etmedi. Şimdi videoyu izliyoruz sayın başkan, oradaki 10-15 kişinin hepsinin çok rahat olduğu gözüküyor. Orada çobana karşı bir eylem gerçekleştiriyorlar ama bizi şikayet edebilir korkusu yok. Hiçbir aile üyesinde çobanın kendisini şikayet edebileceğine dair bir korku yok. Biz bu köyün sahibiyiz, istediğimiz insanı sorgularız, istediğimiz insana istediğimizi yaptırırız rahatlığı içerisindeler. Yine sosyal medyada, sayın başkan, sosyal medyada tehdit mesajları yayınlandı. Yani en çok dikkatimi çeken “İsteyene istediği kadar sevgi, istemeyene istemediği kadar mermi” diye bir paylaşım yapıldı. Sayın başkan bu ailenin anladığım kadarıyla bir sınır yok diyeceğim ama beni aşar onu söylemek ama evet, kendi köylerinde güçlü bir aile. Bu paylaşıma rağmen hala çok rahat şekilde gezebiliyorlar. Bazı şeyleri ifade ediyorlar. Arif Güran dün biliyorsunuz mahkeme içerisinde bir müdahaleden sonra siz Güran ailesinin üyelerini dışarı çıkartın dediğinizde Arif Güran yerinden kalkarak bu tarafa gelip hiç kimse yerinden kalkmasın dedi. Biz böyle bir öz güvenden bahsediyoruz. Duydunuz, duymadınız bilmiyoruz sayın başkan, muhtemelen siz çıktıktan sonraydı. Oraya geldi ve dedi ki hiç kimse dışarı çıkmasın. Sayın başkan sizin verdiğiniz bir karar var ama aile sizin verdiğiniz kararı da uygulamak istemiyor. Ben Nevzat Bahtiyar üzerindeki baskıyı anlatmaya çalışıyorum sayın başkan. Nevzat Bahtiyar.. müdahale etmeyin de, müsaade edin ben bitireyim.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar Üzerindeki Baskı ve Cinayete İştirak İddiasının Reddi ​\nMeslektaşım müsaade edin, ben bitireyim lütfen. Lütfen meslektaşım sakin. Siz de konuşacaksınız, dinleyeceğiz. Ben kendim duydum, siz duymadınız ise ona bir şey diyemem. Şimdi bu rahatlığa, bu güçte yani bu rahatlıkta ve bu güçte düşünen aileye karşı benim müvekkilim Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın, sayın başkan, karşı gelme ihtimali yok. Yani sosyal medyada şöyle bir şey gördüm sayın başkan. Biri diyor ki, “Salim salatalık dese Nevzat Bahtiyar elinde tuzla yardıma koşacak”. Yani Salim’in Nevzat ile ilgili olan işte gerek arkadaşlığı gerek ilişkisi olay günü ne yazık ki müvekkil Nevzat’ı işin içerisine dahil etmiştir. Daraltılmış baz raporu sayın başkan, meslektaşımız açıklamayı yaptı, mahkemenizce itibar edilip edilmeyeceğini bilmiyoruz. Ama iddia makamının iştirak konusunda baz raporunu dikkate aldığı için söylüyorum, kendisiyle çeliştiğini düşünüyorum sayın başkan. Cinayet mahalli ahır, Arif’in evinin çevresi veya o alanda. Tam bunu bilmiyoruz. Daraltılmış baz raporun göre müvekkil Nevzat Bahtiyar olay yerine giden son kişi. 15:27. Şayet cinayet ahırda işlendiyse müvekkilim zaten hiç ahıra gitmedi. Cinayet evde işlendiyse sayın başkan müvekkilim 15:27’de eve geliyor. Her iki ihtimalde de ölüm gerçekleştikten sonra müvekkilim cinayet mahalline gittiği gözüküyor. Daraltılmış baz raporuna göre fikir birliği az önce izah ettim sayın başkan, benim müvekkilimin ya da bu dört kişinin aynı anda bir şeye karar vermesi mümkün değil. Müvekkilim her senaryoda dışarıda kalıyor ama nasılsa iştirak olarak mütalaa verildi. Sayın başkan daraltılmış baz raporuna göre de benim müvekkilim, tekrar ediyorum karar verirken sayın başkan, kafanızda bir canlandırma yapmanızı istiyorum, oturup müzakere yapacaksınız. Cinayet mahalli ahırda ise benim müvekkilim patikada. Cinayet mahalli evin içinde ise benim müvekkilim yine patikada. Önce Salim Güran gidiyor sayın başkan. Ben tabi daraltılmış baz raporundaki aleyhe olan hususları kabul etmemekle birlikte, bunları söylüyorum. Sayın başkan şöyle bir şey düşünmenizi istiyorum. Salim ve Nevzat kendi evlerinin önünde patika yolda bekliyorlar. Narin kızımız yukarı çıktı, Enes Güran bir müdahalede bulundu ve bir ses geldi. Sese ilk müdahaleye giden kişi Salim Güran, 7 dakika sonra benim müvekkilim gidiyor sayın başkan. Eylem birliği nerede? Ölüm gerçekleştikten sonra eylem birliği olmaz. Müvekkilimin 19 gün cenazenin yerini göstermemesi eylem birliği değil sayın başkan. Ölüm gerçekleştikten sonra değil. Ölüm anında orada değil. Benim müvekkilim daraltılmış baz raporuna göre, iddia makamı burada kendi içerisinde çelişiyor, 19 gün doğrudur; kolluğa bildirmedi ama sayın başkan samimi beyanında 4 gün boyunca o cenazeyi o yerinden çıkarıp bir yolun kenarına bırakmak istediğini söyledi. Bulunsun diye. Ne yazık ki hepimiz biliyoruz, köydeki jandarmaların sayısından dolayı bunu dile getirmedi. Şey bu işlemi gerçekleştiremedi. 4 gün boyunca sayın başkan o cenazeyi yerinden çıkarmak için işe gitmediğini söyledi bize ve 4 gün boyunca işe gitmedi zaten. Narin’in bulunması için oradan alınma düşüncesi var ama köydeki asker ve işte personel sayısından dolayı bu işlemi yapamamış. 39 tane tanık dinlendi. Toparlıyorum sayın başkan. 39 tanık dinlendi. Dinlenen tanıklardan hiçbiri müvekkilimin, yani müvekkilimi korumak için bir yalanı yok. Buna da cevap vermiş olayım. Bu arada Gazal Bahtiyar ile ilgili, Mehmet Bahtiyar ile ilgili işte onlar da yalan söyledi. Sayın başkan Mehmet Bahtiyar olay günü ilk aşamada yanlış hatırlıyor ifadeyi verirken. Ancak henüz ifadesi bitmeden, ikinci sayfada ifadesini düzeltiyor. Hatasını anlayıp benim bahsettiğim gün 1 gün önceydi, hep birlikte işe gittiğimiz gün. Nevzat’ın cenazeyi dereye götürdüğü gün yanımızda değildi diyor. Daha ifadesi bitmeden hatasını anlayıp bunu düzeltiyor. Çok acı bir şey sayın başkan. 28-29 Ağustos’ta çiftlik kamerasına bakılmış, DARAN görüntülerine bakılmış, bunlar incelenmiş. Bahsettiğimiz diğer daha net gösteren kamera, onunla ilgili incelemeler yapılmış ama hep 18’den sonraya bakılmış. Bunun sebebi Güran ailesi, müvekkilim değil ve bilinçli yapılan bir şey sayın başkan. Az önce daraltılmış baz raporuyla ilgili zaten meslektaşım dediğim gibi beyanda bulundu ama mahkemenizce itibar edilecekse dahi müvekkil Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın olay yerine giden son kişi olduğu dikkate alındığında eylem ve fikir birliği mümkün değil. Dolayısıyla benim müvekkilim açısından cinayet ve cinayete iştirak suçunun unsurları oluşmamıştır. Çok kısa, çok kısa sayın başkan. Korku ve tehdit sebebiyle bu eylemi gerçekleştirdi de biz burada sizden istediğim bir şey vardı sayın başkan. Cinayet mahallini düşünmeniz. Bunun sebebini izah ettim size. Daraltılmış baz raporuna göre olay yerine giden en son kişi. Bunu düşünmenizi istiyorum. İkinci husus, sayın başkan, bugün Güran ailesinin tamamı müvekkilimi katil olarak gösteriyor. Korkuyu, yani köyde insanlara verdikleri korkuyu çobana dün suç duyurusunda bulundunuz mu diye sordum, hayır dedi. “Allah hakkımı bırakmasın” diyor sayın başkan. Korkudan savcılığa gidemiyor. Köydeki böyle bir aileden bahsediyoruz. İki şey düşünmenizi istiyorum. Olay anında müvekkilimin en son kişi olduğu, ikincisi köydeki korku baskı ve üçüncüsü, sayın başkan, tüm Güran ailesi bu ifadelerine başvurulan tüm insanlar benim müvekkilim için bunu yapmış olamaz. Benim müvekkilim ile bir husumetleri yok. Artık onlara izah ettik sayın başkan. Tüm bu hususlara binaen müvekkilim açısından cinayete iştirak ve cinayet ile ilgili mütalaayı kabul etmiyoruz. Müvekkilin tabii ki beraatını diyeceğiz ancak suç delillerini gizleme ve suçluyu kayırma yönünden zaten kendi kabulü var. Cinayetten beraatına karar verilmesini ve hüküm ile birlikte tahliyesini talep ediyoruz.",

    "text": "AUTHOR\n\n\nYıldıray Oğur\n\n\nLAST UPDATED\n\n\nNovember 11, 2024\n\n\nSOURCE\n\n\nOriginal Source\n\n\nReading Time\n\n\n~ 10 min\n\n\nWord Count\n\n\n1817\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur Miller’s famous play The Crucible tells the story of 29 people tried and executed for witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between 1692 and 1693.\nIn fact, what Miller narrated was not the witch trials in Salem, but the McCarthyist communist witch hunt that began in the United States in the late 1940s.\nIf there were a courageous Arthur Miller in Turkey today, he would write about another trial resembling the witch courts of Salem 400 years ago: the Narin Case that began in Diyarbakır.\nThis requires courage because this case has turned into a mass lynching ritual against a supposedly demonic family, provoked by fake news and allegations that have almost entirely collapsed.\nThe statements made recently in a broadcast by a widely watched journalist were a summary of the demonic, witch-family image created by this enormous pile of misinformation:\n\nIf there is such a thing as the Devil and if you were to give him flesh and bone, he would run away from Tavşantepe village, my brother. That bunch of unknown creatures there is mocking 80 million, 85 million Turkish citizens. Clearly, they have politicians behind them. Clearly, they have taken some powerful AKP figures in the region with them. But the social pressure is so high that even those powerful AKP figures are not enough to cover up the issue in the region—at least as far as we can see for now. The Prosecutor dug deeper and looked at HTS records. Where was whose phone at the time of the murder, or the time thought to be the moment of the murder? They have sort of solved that everything happened in Narin’s house. Because the accused uncle keeps entering and exiting the house. He entered and exited three times. All the aunts, uncles, everyone keeps going in and out, and clearly something was happening inside the house at that time. They went even further and checked water consumption. And at that hour, around the time of the incident, a significant increase in water usage was noticed. During that period. And clearly, a cleaning had been done in the house. They also found that cleaning agents capable of removing DNA traces were used. What we are seeing is that this family is actually a highly conscious pack of killers. They know how to destroy evidence, how to anonymize their crime, how to remove DNA… They know everything. The family behaves like an organized criminal gang. You know what I really think? We are facing such a demonic village that I wish such a place didn’t exist on the map. You are a mother for God’s sake, a mother. And that mother is an accomplice to this crime, my brother. They say they’re protecting them in prison, doing something for their safety. What safety? They have lost all humanity.\n\nHe is angry enough to advocate for the village to be wiped off the map and the family members not to be protected in prison, but he hasn’t even bothered to read the 12-page indictment.\nThe indictment does not claim that all family members were entering and exiting the house; only three family members are alleged to have been there.\nThe claims that carpets were washed or water consumption increased are lies.\nThe allegation that a family whose members have been detained repeatedly, whose three members are on trial for life, and six more are in prison is being protected by the government is entirely baseless. Why would a family accused of murdering a little girl be protected? What special quality could this rural family possibly have? There is not even an answer to such a simple question.\nIn fact, ministers did not even offer their condolences to the family. The Ministry of Family is represented as a complainant in the trial.\nThe Ministry’s lawyer, despite the lack of any evidence, said: “It is considered that the murder occurred due to an incident within the family. The defendants should be punished at the upper limit. No child has ever been left this alone by their closest relatives. Therefore, all of Turkey has become Narin’s family,” and asked defendants about the most absurd allegations.\nSo what is the reason for this collective lynching?\nOf course, the allegations that have been circulating in the media for months and have almost entirely collapsed or been disproven.\nLet’s look at a few:\n\nIt was claimed that a gas station attendant saw Narin’s body wrapped in a blanket on the front seat of Salim Güran’s car and handed over the camera footage to the Gendarmerie. The attendant turned out to be a fake account; the station did not exist, and there was no camera footage.\nWhile Narin was missing, a slipper was found. When the mother said “the slipper does not belong to Narin,” she was accused of trying to obstruct her daughter’s discovery. When Narin was found, her slippers came out of the same sack she had been placed in.\nIt was claimed that the carpets in Narin’s home were washed to destroy evidence. However, the autopsy established that the little girl was manually strangled. So there could be no evidence on the carpets. The indictment shows that all carpets and blankets in the house were examined and no evidence was found.\nFor days it was said that the “Family Council” ordered all villagers to switch from smartphones to keypad phones, and the media reported on the “mafia-like silence” of the demonic family. The indictment revealed that the Gendarmerie had collected the smartphones and distributed keypad phones itself.\nIt was claimed that the Qur’an-course imam was involved and that sexual videos were found on his phone; this was disproven.\nIt was claimed that family members used “burner” phone lines; this was denied.\nIt was claimed that a family member working at the State Waterworks increased the creek’s water flow so the body would decompose faster; false.\nIt was said the house had cameras and recordings were deleted; the cameras were found to have been installed after the incident.\nIt was claimed that recordings of supposed secret family meetings were examined; nothing was found.\nIt was said that Narin was actually Salim’s biological daughter. The indictment includes a DNA report confirming Narin’s biological parents.\nIt was claimed that Narin’s DNA was found on the front seat and steering wheel of Salim’s car; it was actually found on the back seat.\nClaims that the village was a Hezbollah village, a guard village, a tribal village were false. Claims that ammunition was found were also disproven.\nA supposed audio message in which Salim asked his 15-year-old worker R.A. “Ramazan, is the girl dead or alive?” was circulated for days as the recording that solved the murder. This was completely false.\nIn the last court session, the original Kurdish recording was listened to. Not only were the words “girl” or “dead” not present, but even the phrase tiştek te was debated—whether it meant “something of yours” or “sprinkler.”\n\nIn this witch hunt, ideological divides have disappeared; the government and DEM Party stand united.\nEven the defendants’ detailed torture allegations in court are met with applause on social media: “Good, they deserve it, well done Gendarmerie.” When journalists report that mother Yüksel Güran cried in court saying, “Hang me, but don’t insult my honor, why does no one listen to us?” commenters respond with insults, the mildest being “stop the theatrics, you never loved Narin anyway.”\nBar associations and human rights groups that normally react immediately to “allegations of Gendarmerie torture against Kurdish villagers” now ask cold, bureaucratic questions like “Where is the evidence? Have you filed your application?”—simply because they have taken sides in the case based on prejudice.\nThere is a murder, and months later—after the indictment and after three days of hearings—still the only piece of evidence is a so-called conflicting HTS base-station result, a method no one fully understands, placing the mother, uncle, brother, and neighbor Nevzat at home when Narin disappeared.\nAnd the only evidence of what they supposedly did inside the house is the third statement of Nevzat, the man who confessed to burying the body in the creek. His first two statements were based on entirely different scenarios.\nThe first murder claim is this: the uncle and the mother were having sexual relations; Narin saw them, and the uncle killed her.\nAccording to this scenario, the 20-year-old brother was also at home while his mother and uncle were having sexual relations. But when Narin saw it, the uncle killed her. Not the brother—her seeing her mother and uncle supposedly dishonors only her, not him.\nThe second claim is that the brother committed the murder, because Narin saw him in a homosexual relationship, incest, or with a dog. Or there was an accident. The family members then supposedly took a vow of silence to protect him. At the end of the day the brother, mother, and uncle are going toward life sentences, yet for some reason they do not break their silence.\nThe third claim is the strangest: the family is hiding something so terrible that three people choose to destroy their lives to keep it.\nBut the supposedly demonic and calculating family patriarch, Salim, after the murder, calls their neighbor—whom he has been in conflict with over a vehicle sale—and confesses the relationship that supposedly caused him to murder Narin, and then informs him about the murder. Despite having dozens of family members, he assigns the task of disposing of the body to this neighbor.\nAnd all of this supposedly happens within 15 minutes, according to the camera footage.\nThese are the murder scenarios that all of Turkey has accepted without question.\nAnd the witness is a man who immediately agreed to dispose of the body of an 8-year-old girl, put her in a sack, tied the sack with the string from her school bag, placed it by the creek, weighted it down with a 20-kilogram stone, and then went to buy cheese for his aunt.\nMoreover, he confessed not because his conscience troubled him, but because his car was seen on the creek-side security cameras.\nThose who question whether he could be the murderer are accused of protecting the family, being paid by them, or siding with the government. This cold-blooded potential killer is being defended by millions.\nEven the torture of all family members and their tearful statements do not change this powerful public conviction.\nThe crowd is waiting for the hammer to fall. That’s why they cannot tolerate even a defense. Gülben Ergen even demanded that the names of the lawyers defending the suspects be made public.\nFortunately, the presiding judge is fair and listens to the claims, not joining the lynch.\nNew camera footage from the Gendarmerie outpost tower was submitted to the court. Information about how and by whom the conflicting HTS result was created will arrive at the next hearing.\nBut at this point, even if the family turns out not to be witches, the crowd will not be satisfied.\nYes, this is happening in Diyarbakır in 2024, not in Salem in 1692.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The cameras that were supposedly examined were reviewed only from after 18:00, because they were said to show a time two hours later than when the child went missing! The claim by two people from the village that they had seen Narin in the evening, and the uncle’s natural act of relaying this information to the gendarmerie, formed the basis of the absurd accusation that the family had “misled the authorities.”"

    "text": "Astonishing Errors in the Law Enforcement Investigation\nImagine having camera footage right at your fingertips while searching for any trace of a child who left home at noon and never returned. How can it be explained that the officers responsible for reviewing those cameras decided to begin the examination only from the time villagers said they had seen her? What kind of irresponsibility is this?\nIf a child has gone missing, shouldn’t the cameras covering her path be reviewed at least from the early hours of the day — not only to find the child but also to see whether there was anything suspicious nearby? The accusations that made Uncle Salim Güran’s life unbearable are based entirely on his repeating to the gendarmerie what two children claimed — that they had seen Narin in the evening. The audio recording of Salim Güran’s conversation with the gendarmerie is here[1].\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  Salim Güran’s voice record\n\nAs can be heard, Salim Güran conveys exactly what he heard from others to the gendarmerie commander, just as he should have. The villagers, perhaps out of childish irresponsibility or simply by mistake, said they had seen Narin in the evening; this ruined the lives of both those children and the uncle who repeated it. The gendarmerie, or law enforcement in general, burned a family and set a village ablaze while shrugging off the burden of the investigations they had failed to carry out properly and in time. Knowing all this, how can we tolerate such injustice?"

He was at home at the time; he had returned home after midnight from Malatya Arguvan, where he worked as an excavator operator; and everything he said was true — now confirmed in detail by a forensic IT expert through his phone’s image data. To whom should Enes Güran tell his story?\nIt was a miracle that Enes, who had started heavy labor at the age of 18 to support his family and was essentially still just a child, managed to maintain his composure at the trial despite the slanders and absurd accusations he faced. He, too, talked and talked and talked… He answered every question. Anyone can read his defense, yet what should Enes say to those who still, irresponsibly and cruelly, ask, “Why are they silent?”\nFor example, the claims that Enes used drugs were refuted in the very first days with a doctor’s report. I’m also sharing that report here, but just like in political frame-up cases, no evidence, no document is accepted in the “Narin Frame-up Case” — because consciences are darkened.\n\n\n\nForensic report[2] confirming Enes Güran did not use drugs"

    "text": "Nevzat Bahtiyar and Ignored Suspicions\nWhen the family was asked during the days Narin was missing whether they had any disputes with anyone, they pointed to Nevzat Bahtiyar. They said that a disagreement had arisen after discovering that Nevzat had sold them a stolen car, and that he had paid them 50,000 lira in compensation after the matter came to light[3]. Their statements on this issue were ignored, and they were met with the dismissive response, “Would anyone harm a child over 50,000 lira?” Yet there are countless similar cases. For instance, consider the first case in Turkey solved through DNA analysis[4] — how cruel, how similar, how thought-provoking it was. In Diyarbakır, a father and son were recently murdered and burned over 200,000 lira. Did no one hear about it?\nIn short, if the Güran family mentioned such a dispute, the person involved should have been immediately and seriously questioned. Since the case was brushed aside, the Gürans failed to suspect Nevzat, who had stayed close to them and appeared to be supportive during the search for Narin. They were so crushed by the grave accusations that their ability to reason about what might have happened was paralyzed. Among hundreds of gendarmerie officers, dozens of journalists, the constant comings and goings, endless gossip, and hostile stares, they came to distrust everyone and everything — even themselves.\nThus, they never had another chance to think or speak about the Devil again. Another accusation directed at the family was that when a red car was mentioned on the day of the incident, they did not immediately say it belonged to Nevzat. Yet the vehicle in which Nevzat is believed to have transported Narin’s body was apparently not his but his son’s, and the son did not live in the village. Therefore, whoever saw that car leaving the village did not recognize it. When a red car was mentioned, it was only natural that no one thought of Nevzat’s vehicle — one they barely knew, not well enough to recognize from afar."

    "text": "The Unanswerable Question: “Why Were They Silent?”\nPeople ask why they were silent, why they didn’t speak. But the real question should have been this: if Salim had killed Narin and given her body to Nevzat to make it disappear, and if the “killer family” knew everything, then to whom was Nevzat performing his theater of consolation for 19 days? Why did no one tell him to stay away, to stop roaming around?"

Many die suspiciously in prison soon after being incarcerated; some are killed before even being imprisoned; others spend years behind bars. None of this is ever deterrent. Lacking empathy, sociopathic child murderers clearly do not possess the mental capacity to weigh the consequences of their actions.\nNevzat, after placing three stones over Narin’s body and lingering inexplicably for some time, returned to the village, bought cheese from his sister-in-law, and drank tea… According to {internet traffic analysis[5], he did not access the internet at all from the time Narin disappeared on the school camera until after the minutes when her lifeless body was taken to and buried by the creek."

    "section": "A Matter of Conscience Beyond Politics",
    "text": "A Matter of Conscience Beyond Politics\nAs for me, while trying to support this quest for justice in my constituency, I still hear remarks like “This family expelled you from the village” or “Salim Güran said in court that he expelled DEM Party members.” Frankly, I cannot understand how this casts any shadow on the family’s possible innocence. They probably mean this: even if this family is innocent, why should you/we be the ones to defend their innocence — let them suffer their punishment. The “dark face of the era” I spoke of relates to this as well — the ease with which guilt is ascribed to those unlike us, and not just any guilt…\nThis unethical understanding of justice, which suggests imprisoning innocent people for life for crimes they didn’t commit, is truly repulsive. Let me clarify first: I went to the village during the days Narin was missing. No one there treated me or the delegation accompanying me rudely. We sat in Narin’s parents’ house for about 45 minutes, shared their anxiety, conveyed our good wishes, and left. But yes, I also heard Salim Güran’s statement firsthand at the second hearing.\nThen and now, I think the same thing. Salim Güran, in despair, trusted the AKP government and the state, and believing that their perceived closeness to our party meant they could never escape this ordeal, he said, “I expelled the DEM Party from the village.” Otherwise, even if he did not sympathize with our party, there was no reason for him to say that in court. He would not have turned against any group — least of all a party that won eight parliamentary seats in Diyarbakır.\nAnyone trapped so horrifically might have acted the same way, carrying in their memory the government’s intense campaign at that time to criminalize the DEM Party. In any case, regardless of the reason, it is truly shocking to think that the pursuit of justice — by one of the country’s largest political parties — could or should depend on whether sympathy toward it exists. We know well what a great legacy of struggle the DEM Party has inherited. Suppose a village from which it was “expelled” is unfairly set ablaze and not a single member turns back to look — then that legacy was never deserved, and nothing of it remains today. More importantly, in a matter that has captured national attention from Iğdır to İmralı, it is vital to imagine a pursuit of justice that rises above all such calculations and ideological divides. Such a pursuit exists, and it gives me great hope."

    "text": "The Path to Social Peace: A Shared Ethical Stance\nThe common ground created by people from different provinces, professions, and ideologies who have come together day and night for Narin is immensely valuable. There are citizens who, at their own expense, commissioned an animated film for Narin to convey the simplicity of the truth. I, too, shared this film, even though it was originally posted by someone whose profile displayed nationalist symbols. A few of my friends thought my account had been hacked when they saw I shared it.\nBut I had not focused on that at all. Because the effort and ethical stance of a Turkish nationalist who wholeheartedly supported justice for a Kurdish family with limited Turkish, working tirelessly day and night, must not be overlooked. If this country is ever to share a common future, then taking a shared ethical stance on issues beyond politics will be one of the guarantees of that future. There is no other way.\nThere are also many DEM Party members among those demanding justice for Narin’s family and defending them. They often support my efforts on social media by saying, “I’m proud of my party.” And at those moments, I too feel proud.\nIf this country is to cultivate a true culture of democracy and social peace amid such a poisonous climate of polarization, it will be thanks to these people — those who step out of their comfort zones, feel responsibility, and without saying “But it’s complicated,” “But your article is too long,” or “But their statements were contradictory,” uncover every claim and expose every distortion created by media disinformation. Not those who speak freely when it’s easy, only to turn their backs when it becomes hard…\nBecause social peace and normalization are, above all, matters of culture; they cannot be effortlessly built or imposed from above. Those who grasp the simplicity of Narin’s truth despite all its difficulty, and who keep this issue alive day and night together, are also the harbingers of such a culture.\n#NarinveAilesiİçinAdalet (JusticeForNarinAndHerFamily)\n\n\n\nExternal References (5)\n\n\nX: Ferhatt - A link to a post ↩︎\n\n\nX: Mustafa Demir - A link to a post ↩︎\n\n\nBBNHABER: Day 3 of the Narin Case: What Is the Exchange Between Father Arif and Confessor Nevzat?

    "section": "Media and Perception in the Narin Case",
    "text": "Media and Perception in the Narin Case\nBy now, I think we should know why we were locked, twenty-four hours a day and at every age, onto the incident of Narin’s disappearance, why we went to bed with Narin and woke up with Narin. Within a few days after Narin went missing, her family was targeted, in part due to a horrific journalism and media practice. Leave aside those who call themselves YouTubers, TikTok personalities, very famous or semi-famous people — I am talking about names who are treated as real journalists. They practiced a kind of dreadful reporting that trampled on journalistic ethics and professional codes. It was reporting done as if they knew nothing at all about these ethics. Perhaps they truly did not.\nAfter all the pressure and all the devastation that the media has suffered, what we are left alone with is this kind of disastrous journalism. Until now I did not want to give any specific examples, but please, now, watch this report[1] and the previous interviews. See what poor Mother Yüksel is saying and how the journalist — who at that time had considerable impact on the public agenda — conveys it… In order to climb to the top of the agenda for angry and prejudiced crowds, she gives them exactly what they want. Is there any other explanation? If they want us to forget what they did, they must offer self-criticism and apologize for this kind of journalism.\n\nThe Responsibility of Celebrities and the Sexist Narrative\nSpeaking of celebrities, I did not want to reproduce it, but this post[2] is still up on X in a manner that is, to put it mildly, irresponsible. As you see, Yüksel Güran had not yet even appeared in court once, had not had the chance to defend herself, had not had the chance to explain what happened to her, and yet she was branded through a heavy, sexist insult that was reinterpreted. In response to the growing criticism against her, the owner of that post said on social media just yesterday, “Since August 21, we have only believed in the court panel, in proven evidence, and in the reasoned decision.” Yet in the first month of the incident — when neither a hearing had taken place nor a single piece of evidence had been found against her — she had shared that grave tweet without even entertaining the possibility that Yüksel Güran might be innocent. Moreover, no one who claims, in any form, a kind of rights advocacy or assumes responsibility when it comes to women’s and children’s rights can use that sexist language toward anyone, even if that person were proven guilty. In any reasonable country in the world, for a person who opens preschools here and there to use such language would draw a severe reaction. In short, they stomped for days, for months, with cleated boots on the wounded hearts of Narin’s family…\nMeanwhile, for years and years, audiences had been watching all forms of domestic violence and strangeness in TV dramas at least three hours a day. Thanks to the daytime programming genre represented by Esra Erol, they had also long become familiar with so-called True Crime. In the post-truth era, the border separating reality from fiction had long been violated; the fact that the lives being trampled on were real lives had in many cases been completely ignored. In the Narin case, everyone had a storyline, and everyone wanted to shoot their own movie. Who cared about Yüksel Güran?\n\n\nThe Silence of Journalism\nOf course, someone needed to recount what happened here in an orderly and detailed way — to be able to recount it. For example, I wish one of the journalists with a respected press tradition in that region, someone who knows the region and its people, someone who can foresee what is possible and what is not possible there, had focused on this issue. I wish someone could have seen, with the same rare perceptiveness and reflex shown in that magnificent photograph capturing the naked truth of Kemal Kurkut, the morbid attention that turned toward Tavşantepe with hatred, becoming a kind of demon-burning ritual… I wish someone had, instead of internalizing this hatred through a self-orientalist impulse or remaining entirely indifferent to what happened, properly analyzed it and investigated Narin’s killing from outside this state of frenzy.\nBecause I repeat once more: this incident was also a matter of investigative journalism. Unfortunately, for quite some time, no one investigated. As Pierre Bourdieu exposed years ago in his work On Television, they chose a form of newsmaking that was like mirrors reflecting each other. That was not journalism at all. Particularly in the early period of the incident, apart from journalist Rojda Altıntaş’s justifiedly cautious efforts to mention contradictions and to question Nevzat’s role, no genuine effort was made.\nYıldıray Oğur became the first to draw attention to the possibility that the family and the village might be innocent, by featuring a letter sent to him by Miham Akkul from Diyarbakır, who is doing graduate studies in France. Later on, both Yıldıray Oğur and Mihan Akkul wrote about this. However, although these writings dealt well with baseless claims and so on, they did not turn into a detailed and in-depth analysis or piece of reporting capable of drawing the attention of a broader public.\nStill, the Serbestiyet circle, in the following period, not only brought to the agenda the hatred and unlawfulness directed at Narin’s family, but also continually opened space for reports and new information on problematic evidence such as the so-called narrowed-down cell-site analysis[3]. This was a very important effort. The piece I wrote in January titled We owe Narin the truth was published in a media environment that was, in this sense, a desert of truth. Considering the outlet in which it was published, it must be admitted that it was a relatively long piece. Had it not been so — that is, had it not been written at length, step by step, with the care of walking through a minefield — it is likely that both I and the outlet that published it would have faced a brutal lynching. Thankfully, that care protected me, protected bianet, and protected a family that had already suffered enough.\n\n\nThe Uniqueness of the Case and the Contradictions\nNow let us return again to the question of how unique this case is. There are indeed families who kill their children and do terrible things to them. But in the Narin case there were so many contradictions and inconsistencies that prevent us from accepting this crude information as an explanation… Simply taking the trouble to address these inconsistencies and these contradictions that defy the normal course of life, stepping out of one’s discursive and mental comfort zone, and having the courage to do so regardless of the result — that alone would have sufficed. In other words, examining the claims that were presented as concrete evidence, examining much of the information and documentation that is actually accessible, and seeing that almost none of it has any evidentiary value — this already led us to that simple truth. Sadly, this was not done. People remained in an ideological comfort zone. A family assumed to hold great power, great money, or great influence suddenly turned into the symbolic counterpart of the AKP government — in other words, of Leviathan.\n\n\nPolitical Symbols and the Frenzied Reaction\nYet it was impossible not to notice how truly defenseless they turned out to be in a very short time. In addition to the AKP, other hatreds — Hizbullah, Hüda Par, JİTEM — were added to the picture… It was as if, if Tavşantepe and the Güran Family were punished in the most merciless way, all the missed opportunities up to now would somehow be redeemed. I have written about this before. I will not dwell on it. It was as if, for the first time, the impunity in cases of violence against women and children had finally reached an end, and as if an opportunity had emerged to punish the killers in the person of a supposedly powerful family aligned with the government, and no one wanted that opportunity to be lost. It would not be allowed to slip away.\nYet the family was not one of the powerful families of the region. The AKP government’s representatives in the region should have known that better than anyone — and I believe they realized it instantly. And they largely abandoned both Tavşantepe Village, said to be the core of their own voter base, and the Güran Family to the frenzy of a media and public reaction turned hysterical. A single sentence spoken — probably offhand and to this day unexplained — by the AKP Diyarbakır MP also, unfortunately, had a significant effect in destroying the family. In short, the government-state that the Güran family wanted to trust, and did trust, simply placed its mask before the Tavşantepe hunters and quietly stepped aside.\n\n\nThe Repeated Face of the Frame-Up\nMoreover, if the family is innocent — and I believe those on the government side formed that opinion — the experienced legal professionals who intervened in the case would have seen it in the judicial process… Yet things at home did not match things in the marketplace. Thus, they did not prevent the torture and the imposition of aggravated life sentences on the residents of a village said to be largely close to the AKP, on members of a wounded family, in the so-called Year of the Family. In sum, this was also a kind of frame-up case. Those who struggled for years against the Kobanî Frame-Up Case foresaw that, if silence prevailed here, such frame-ups would engulf society as a whole. In fact, the Gezi Trial had emerged with the same frame-up pattern. I think what was not taken into account was that now, setting aside “opposition” or not, any ordinary citizen in any non-political case — even purely criminal matters — could suddenly fall prey to frame-ups of a massive scale that spill across the entire country.\nThrough days and nights of hearings, from Kobanî to Gezi to all the political cases dragged toward statute of limitations, judges, chief judges, and prosecutors — who sat there in the courtroom as if filing their nails under the table or surfing the internet at leisure, exhibiting not a pursuit of justice but merely a presence — had by now perhaps nothing left to offer… These legal actors, who for years had never been entrusted with any meaningful share of responsibility for ensuring justice, and who themselves had never tried to claim such a responsibility, had also lost any reflex for justice in criminal cases.\nThe truly horrifying thing, however, was that lawyers who for years had intervened in those same courtrooms in political trials, when they took part in a criminal case like the Narin Case, became unable to see the sack being pulled over the head of the victim family, or the frame-up, because they identified the victim family with the centers of power and authority. The reason why they too maintained a similar lack of reflex or were drawn into defenses focused not on achieving results but on performance and rhetorical dominance must be sought, at least in part, here.\n\n\nThe Blunting of Critical Vision\nCritical vision had become so dulled that it was no longer sufficient to grasp and accept the simple truth standing in plain sight. Speaking to the cameras became the prevailing stance. The effort to produce answers for the broad masses who reflected their unrestrained anger at the political power onto Narin’s family also prevented seeing the chain of events in the Narin Case, as a criminal case, in all its starkness.\nThe political character of the Narin case must be understood in this way.\n\n\n\nExternal References (3)\n\n\nX: Kibele - A link to a post ↩︎\n\n\nX: Gülben Ergen - A link to a post ↩︎\n\n\nSERBESTİYET: Onur Erkan - Forensic IT Experts Explain the “Narrowed Base Station” in the Narin Case: “A 2-Meter Margin of Error Does Not Exist Anywhere in the World; the U.S. Aims for 50 Meters” (27 June 2025) ↩︎"

    "section": "The Normalization of Evil",
    "text": "The Normalization of Evil\nAlmost a year has passed since Narin’s death. What happened to that beautiful child and to her family showed us the dark face of this era; how “evil becomes ordinary,” and how it absorbs everyone. With the developments surrounding it before and after, the Narin case struck us in the face with a harshness with which we may never have witnessed the normalization of evil in modern Turkey. An ominous event for which words fall short, born entirely of irresponsible conduct that never once recalled an ethic of responsibility toward the other. A great evil… Moreover, this irresponsibility was inverted in a way never seen before and clothed itself in the appearance of “standing up for a missing little girl.”\nIf you look at a social media post made just yesterday, the family were murderers because “there was blood pouring like out of a glass” on the rocks near Narin’s house. That is the exact wording! And no one would say: this child, who was killed by having her mouth and nose covered to cut off her air — apart from the fact that she herself remained a still-bleeding wound — which part of her was bleeding such that blood would spread all the way to the rocks? Nonsensical claims and lies kept being repeated.\nThose who proclaimed these lies nonstop on social media under the guise of some supposed journalistic activity were being exalted as “He was like a father to Narin!” No one was saying that Narin already had a father. A father who said “I would give my life for my daughter”… Are they being a father to Narin by slowly killing Narin’s innocent mother, her brother, and her uncle in solitary cells hundreds of kilometers away from their home? Apart from killing Narin a thousand more times and shredding her memory into pieces, what else have these people — who supposedly seek justice for Narin — achieved for Narin?\nWith mind-numbing irresponsibility the lies continued, and continue still. What happened to the Güran Family and to Tavşantepe Village is like an apocalyptic sign. As if the Dajjal (the Antichrist) has appeared… You know that “Dajjal” means “liar, deceiver, one who mixes up truth and falsehood, good and evil.” That is exactly it. I do not know where to begin…\nThese days I wanted to write something partly about developments in the Narin case and partly about Sırrı Süreyya Önder. But it was not possible. In a constant rush I could not find the time to write these pieces separately. But today I realized that in my mind these two subjects are in constant conversation and stitched to one another. The fact that Sırrı Süreyya Önder is so loved is, to a great extent, related to his openness to understanding other lives and stories — in other words, to his wisdom. He was truly one of those exceptional figures with the ability to pass through stories and form a deep and powerful bond with the truth. In the Narin case, that is precisely what happened. Sırrı Süreyya immediately distilled the truth I have been struggling and struggling to articulate, as soon as he read what I had written and the interview I had given. I am sure that he also quickly grasped how this incident was related to the near-total collapse of the media and judicial order, and the fact that many legal professionals could not escape that collapse, and thus its political character. I will try to explain these in the following sections. But I am afraid this will be a long piece. For that reason I am dividing the article for you into five sections following this introduction. We will publish one section each day."

    "section": "New developments",
    "text": "New developments\nA lot has happened over time. First of all, the well-known digital forensics expert Tuncay Beşikçi analyzed and reported on the internet traffic image logs of Yüksel, Enes, and Salim Güran for the day Narin was killed. Beşikçi also examined the “narrowed base station record” study that formed the basis of the reasoned judgment and of the aggravated life sentences issued for the family members. Thanks to him we fully understood that this retrospective so-called narrowed base station record is the sort of entirely invalid work that would not be taken seriously anywhere in the world.\n\nInternet Traffic and Proof of Innocence\nIn fact, the internet traffic information and image logs for the three family members sentenced to aggravated life in prison — for the relevant day and time — were already present in and accessible to the case. Yet despite the persistent insistence of the family’s lawyers at the sentencing hearing, this information was not taken into account, and judgment was announced without waiting for the content of that internet traffic to be examined.\nWith Tuncay Beşikçi’s report we understood that these logs contained data that entirely revealed the innocence of the family members. During the critical hours of the incident they were doing exactly what they had said in their statements. Salim was in his own home, Enes and the mother were in their own home. Essentially this information was already established by witness testimony. They had not even managed to force six-year-old Eren to say otherwise. But no one wanted to consider this simple fact.\n\n\nThe Troll Army Replacing Sensationalism\nIn the time since judgment was handed down in the Narin case, one segment that had shown intense interest in the case has left the stage and become entirely indifferent to the construction of justice. The stage has been left to certain grotesque entities that have made a name and profit out of sensational criminal cases, and to social media influencers and a troll army. They wanted the Güran Family to be destroyed. Strangely, by now it no longer even mattered to them whether the family was actually guilty. There were even those who said, “If they couldn’t protect a little girl, then they already deserve this punishment!” They could not bring themselves to say, “May God spare every child from encountering evil”…\nEverything was extremely strange. For example, the lawyer defending Nevzat Bahtiyar behaved just like a troll and considered any amount of confusion he could sow as a gain. He was exhibiting the same sort of grave defense practice we saw a few years ago in Ankara from the lawyer who defended the murderer of the young academic staff member Ceren Damar. Without realizing that he himself was throwing the reasoned judgment — the very basis for the ruling — into the trash, he was putting forth new claims destined for the trash. For example, he was saying that Narin was not killed because she came home and witnessed something, but — to paraphrase — because she witnessed something or something happened to her before she went to the course. On another day he was trying to place cousins who, as established in the trial process, were not even in the village that day at the scene of the incident. He was viciously and in a manner constituting criminal accusation targeting the desperate mother in prison and Enes. In short, a merciless and relentless slander and defamation campaign with no basis whatsoever had been given the name “Justice for Narin.”\n\n\nThe UKB Report and the “Shadow” Claim\nOne of the two fundamental studies forming the basis of the reasoned judgment was darbaz; the other was the National Criminal Bureau’s (UKB) image enhancement and reporting work. This study claimed that Narin supposedly walked up the slope along the footpath and identified her as a shadow in front of the family’s barn. Yet according to the reasoned judgment, the same footpath allegedly had two other people going up and down it within a minute or two — and the UKB report could not see them at all. Supposedly Uncle Salim, who walked the same path right after Nevzat_Bahtiyar to take back from him the blanket in which the child’s body was being carried to the Gürans’ house, could not be identified in the report. Therefore, to the already deeply problematic assessment — which the family’s lawyers had explained with great clarity — the digital forensics expert Tuncay Beşikçi also drew attention in detail.\nBeşikçi laid out in full the absurdity of considering a shadow as evidence in a criminal trial. It was also understood that the point identified as where Narin and “the movement” were visible was a rocky and brushy area. It was clearly explained that the shadow labeled as Narin could not possibly be Narin, because even an hour after the incident the same shadow was still standing in the exact same spot. After these pieces of evidence were submitted to the appellate court, not a single minute more should have been spent in prison by the family members, including Salim Güran. Because at those minutes Salim Güran was, almost uninterruptedly, browsing the internet and making use of the internet in a way that could not be characterized as just background activity. The court’s own reasoned judgment was already telling us that the same phone was not with someone else but on his person. No reasonable person could claim that he was participating in a murder at the same time he was actively browsing the internet.\n\n\nThe Appellate Process and the Presiding Judge’s Dissenting Opinion\nAlongside all of this, in the appellate process the presiding judge also attached a lengthy dissenting opinion to the reasoned judgment. The appellate petitions were examined at the Diyarbakır 8th High Criminal Court and forwarded to the Diyarbakır Regional Court of Appeal 1st Criminal Chamber for review. The Chamber reviewing the file and the submissions upheld, by majority vote, on May 26, the prison sentences given to the four defendants. The Presiding Judge, however, attached a dissent and laid out his reasoning at length. In the dissent the presiding judge stated that the footage in the file, the base station records, and the DNA findings had been inadequately and insufficiently examined, and in particular that there was a need to clarify Nevzat Bahtiyar’s movements through detailed image analysis.\nHe stated that it was neither reasonable nor consistent with the ordinary flow of life that mother Yüksel Güran, her son Enes Güran, and Uncle Salim Güran killed Narin within minutes, acting as co-perpetrators, immediately after Narin supposedly came home. The dissent also stated that critical evidence such as PSA and hair samples had not been scientifically examined in a sufficient manner and that, due to all of these deficiencies, the judgment should be overturned.\n\n\nThe India Report and New Findings\nAnother development after this date was the report prepared by Brilliant Forensic Investigation (BFI), an India-based digital forensics firm, which determined that Narin did not make it past Nevzat Bahtiyar’s house and that she was abducted near that house. Narin never reached her own home. India’s global reputation and success in information technologies is well known. The report also stated that the previous reports prepared by UKB and the German expert were flawed. This BFI report was appended by Salim Güran’s lawyer, Onur Akdağ, to the petition for review and submitted to the Court of Cassation.\n\n\nThe Collapse of the Court’s Judgment\nAll of these developments should have nullified the consequences of the already deeply problematic court ruling for Yüksel, Enes, and Salim. Because at present there is not a single — not even one — sound, undisputed, concrete piece of evidence that justifies these aggravated life sentences. On the contrary, there are many witnesses and much evidence submitted at the appellate stage that testify to the exact opposite. At the outset, the most concrete information available was that Nevzat Bahtiyar, for 19 days, misled Narin’s family and all law enforcement, accompanied them in the searches, supposedly consoled the family, and kept up this filthy act until he was caught.\nUntil days later a farm camera recording captured the red vehicle in which it was understood that the child’s lifeless body had been carried, he did not say a single word. When it was determined that the red vehicle was being driven by Nevzat, Nevzat was not at his own home in Tavşantepe, he was at his son’s home in Çarıklı; and until that place was raided, he had not surfaced. On the day Narin’s lifeless body was found, he was forced to confess, as a matter of necessity, that he had placed the child’s body, with her sandal still on her foot and her bag still around her neck, into a sack and transported it by car to Eğertutmaz Creek.\nIn his first statement he said that he then placed the child’s body there, still in the sack, into a pit by the creek bank, and that he put a big stone on top, and that there were two stones on either side — in other words, that he hid the child’s body beneath three stones. Nevzat Bahtiyar later changed this chilling statement in two respects: At the sentencing hearing, while saying that he had supposedly carried Narin from her father’s house in his arms as he left the house (he paused noticeably at the unexpected question “Where was the sandal then”), he said that Salim handed him the sandal, having taken it from the entrance door. He claimed he concealed the child behind himself, and he reduced the number of stones, now saying there was a single stone, in order to strengthen the claim that later Salim went to Eğertutmaz Creek and placed the other two stones. Yet in this video you can still watch his first statement where he speaks of three stones.\nIn short, as a result of an utterly bizarre trial process unlike anything else in the world, three grieving family members — who, according to Nevzat Bahtiyar’s own statement, for whom there is not one single concrete piece of evidence, and where the only person proven to have touched, carried, and buried the child’s body is Nevzat — were sentenced to aggravated life in prison. If the Court of Cassation accepts the judgment in this way, Nevzat Bahtiyar will, in not much more than a month or two, be walking among us having completed his sentence…\n\n\nDNA and the Sandal Inconsistency\nIf we recall that there were findings of abuse on the child’s body, then those who want the family members to rot in prison and who resist any healthy, concrete, and reliable information whatsoever must once again consider whose side they are on. Without bothering to read or examine a single explanation, a single report, those who accuse the family with the zeal of fanatical supporters write under every article, post, and message asserting the family’s innocence: “But the DNA in the car, but the hair in Narin’s palm.” There are those who romanticize the murder by saying, “Narin hid her killer in her palm.”\nIn the end I do not think this will change that hateful and irresponsible attitude, but I would like to explain once more: Nothing could be more natural than the child’s DNA being in the uncle’s car. Narin’s family themselves had already said that their daughter had been in that car in the recent past. The claim that this DNA came from some kind of vomit or postmortem fluid could not, in any way, be confirmed in the court proceedings. The fact that the DNA was in more than one spot in the car corresponded to the assertion that Narin had been in the car when alive and moving around.\nAbove all, in the sentencing hearing where the family members were given aggravated life sentences, Nevzat Bahtiyar said in his latest statement that he transported Narin in his own vehicle. Everyone who believes that final statement by Nevzat must also accept that the child’s body never touched Salim’s car after death, and that this DNA was something the child left in the vehicle while she was alive. If Nevzat is lying again, then that means adding this statement to the many false statements as to how and where Salim supposedly handed the child to him. In that case it is as clear as day that a person who is telling so many lies without cause and misleading the court to have an entire family sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment is concealing his own crime, not someone else’s. Because in nearly a year no clue pointing to anything or anyone else has emerged. If there were even the slightest concrete evidence about the murder, after all that the family and the entire village have suffered for a year, it would not have been possible for it not to surface. Those who say, “If Nevzat had done it, surely someone in the village would have seen,” do not want to believe that in the seclusion of a pathway where there are no other houses nearby, harm could be done to a child within minutes without anyone seeing.\nYet we are talking about a child who weighed only 23 kilos… It feels more comfortable to believe that this harm was done to Narin in her own home and jointly by her own family members. They believe that this tiny, frail child somehow bruised her brother’s eye at that moment, caused abrasions on his body, bit his arm, and that the mother then ripped out his hair. When you say this is impossible, then they say that the bruise around Enes’s eye or the bite on his arm may have come from the mother or the uncle when they “caught him hurting the child”…\nThese are arguments that rely on nothing but a vicious imagination that is extremely difficult to contend with and that is not grounded in a single concrete piece of evidence. None of the legal professionals who contributed to the imposition of aggravated life sentences on three family members through the reasoned judgment has, unfortunately, been able to put forward a rational argument that transcends this malice, this disinformation, and this gossip-mongering.\nAs for the hair strand in the child’s palm, the 29 cm brown hair strand for which mitochondrial DNA testing determined that it “belongs to the maternal line” cannot, in terms of either color or length, belong to the mother or the brothers. The determination that it belongs to the maternal line also means that this hair could belong to Narin herself, which is a far more plausible possibility given both the length of the hair and the manner of the child’s death. Because as a little child being killed by strangulation struggles to escape the hand at her throat, her own hair could easily wind around that hand and get caught in her palm. Just as it is most likely that the hair on one’s own clothing belongs to oneself. Indeed, after the family’s lawyers, today a forensic medicine specialist also said he was of this opinion.\n\n\nAbsurd Claims and Village Gossip\nWhen you explain all of this separately and draw attention to the baselessness of “He said this, she said that”-style village gossip, this time you get comments that truly make one want to scream, like: “So did this child kill herself, was it the overlock machinist passing through the village who killed her?” At this point I think psychoanalysts and social psychologists need to analyze the situation. An entire country seems almost hypnotized, with eyes and ears completely closed to the straightforward possibility that the killer might simply be the person who physically carried and buried Narin. As if the person who lied time and again throughout the judicial process and misled everyone were some kind of ghost… as if he could not possibly commit murder! “If Nevzat had committed this murder, the family would never have left him alive,” they say. That is their only argument. I will address separately how baseless this already very flimsy general rationale is, but essentially when Nevzat was apprehended the uncle was already under arrest. On the day Narin’s body was found, her mother, her father, her brother Enes, and her uncles — along with dozens of other people from the family and the village — were also taken into custody. So there was no such possibility of “not leaving him alive.” Beyond that, it cannot be asserted as certain knowledge that any given family would seek an extrajudicial solution in such a matter. There is no data whatsoever in terms of the Güran Family’s history in the village to support such a claim.\nThe most absurd part is that when those who accuse the family and defend Nevzat have all their claims refuted, they move on to sowing confusion by talking about the crowds, the people, the hustle and bustle on the footpath that Narin allegedly walked at the time of the incident, and by implying, overtly or covertly, that the entire village was involved. Nevzat’s own lawyer is among them. No one says: why do you not ask Nevzat, “Who were these people?” Because at those minutes he himself had already said that he was at least there to water eggplants. He also said that shortly thereafter he went to Arif’s house and that he carried the child’s body from there to the barn. As can be seen, the merciless lies being told are increasingly tossing aside even the pretense of consistency.\nIn short, people continue to believe that the Güran family had some as-yet-unrevealed purpose, motive, or motivation in the murder. Moreover, it is implicitly or explicitly argued that the entire village, from the youngest to the oldest, participated in this secret with a level of taciturnity that could not exist even in a dystopian work of science fiction. Yet as Bernard Williams says in his book Truth and Truthfulness, “everyone poking their noses into each other’s business is a tiresome feature of villagers. In fact, in small traditional communities, people typically lie all the time precisely because it is so hard to keep anything secret.” (p.152).\nIt is impossible to understand the refusal to accept the childish lies or confusion spoken in a small village a few hours after the incident, when it was not yet known what horrific thing had happened to Narin and when it was probably assumed she would pop out from somewhere and come back. The simple reality of a village atmosphere is being rejected. In this process — which has already traumatized the next generations of the village and frankly ruined all of their reputations — people believe in the existence of a secret that has not been revealed for a year. Because they want to believe. Because they believed once… and now insisting on it is easier than saying “We were wrong.”\n\n\nThe Spread of Evil\nThis is what I mean by the dark face of this era… This is what I mean by the normalization of evil and its absorption of everyone. After Narin, the fact that her dearest ones — her innocent mother, her 18-year-old brother — are being slowly killed, under severe isolation in a cell, is something that many people find, unbelievably, not disturbing at all. The fire of the police-thriller excitement sparked by the incident has burned out. Who cares about Tavşantepe Village, about a peasant family there? The journalists, the TV people, the rights defenders, the jurists — all back in their homes, busy with their own work…\nSo what is the family doing, what state are they in at the end of this apocalyptic year? I was thinking about this too, on the plane I boarded about a week ago to fly to Erzincan to visit mother Yüksel and her son Enes, which took off from Ankara at 00:05 just past midnight. I will tell that tomorrow."

    "text": "AUTHOR\n\n\nE. Miham Akkul\n\n\nLAST UPDATED\n\n\nNovember 7, 2024\n\n\nSOURCE\n\n\nOriginal Source\n\n\nReading Time\n\n\n~ 16 min\n\n\nWord Count\n\n\n2992\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 2000 years ago, at the very beginning of our calendar, they tortured Jesus Christ with spiked rods and barbed whips; they placed on the head of this good-hearted man, who spoke of the kingdom of heaven — or the son of God — a crown of thorns, and then threw him into a dungeon to bring him before Governor Pontius Pilate the next day. That night, Pontius Pilate’s wife, Claudia Procula — who, though not considered a saint by Catholics, is regarded as one by the Orthodox — pleaded with her governor husband: “Can you not pardon him?” Pontius Pilate said that, should a new uprising of the Israelites occur, Emperor Augustus would have his head; he was trapped between his office and justice. And finally the day came, they stood the Messiah beside Pontius Pilate; he was covered in blood, the vindictive crowd had gathered. “Here is the pitiful state of this insolent one,” said Pontius Pilate. “Is this not enough?”\nIt was not enough! The rabbis cried out in unison, shouting their true demand: Crucify him!…\nHonorable Judges, Esteemed Justices, I wish to address you in whatever manner most flatters your pride; I do not wish to take risks, for this is my final article on the matter, the last bullet in my rifle. Whether you are truly venerable, whether you possess any respectable side, I do not know. Perhaps you arrived at your positions through various patronages. Perhaps you arrived through hard work, yet all you ever did was pass a few exams, keep your hands clean, become judges, and in this life, take pleasure in the tension your arrival and departure — “the judges have come, the judges have gone” — created among a few drivers and bailiffs. You strove for this and received your reward. The bailiff, the driver, the police officer, even the young clerk are anxious; rest assured, you have succeeded. But perhaps it is not so; perhaps you realized, even in childhood, how terrible and suffocating tyranny and injustice can be, and you labored since those years, and now you have become such sensitive and serious practitioners of law that you can sense the rise and fall of a prisoner’s anxiety in the swallow of the throat you button your shirt over every morning in front of the mirror. The weight of the duty to deliver justice presses upon your chest like a gravestone, and you speak only after thinking a thousand times with utmost seriousness. You live with the noble relief of passing through the finest scales the judgments you issue about defendants whose ties to life and relationships hang by a thread. How beautiful it would be if you were such people; in a country with such judges, people would sleep peacefully at night. I did not try to learn who you are; had I tried, I would likely have had no strength left to write this letter — perhaps it would have scourged me further. You see, prejudice is a terrible thing, is it not, Honorable Judges? At the start of the paragraph, your eyebrows furrowed at my belittling assumptions, then, when I mentioned your noble purpose, a sacred illumination crossed your face, your hearts sweetened. Yes, these pre-judgments are terrible things; according to the man known as the smartest on earth, they are more difficult than atomic physics.\nStill, let us incline toward the best possibility and assume you are the kind of human beings who deserve these noble stories, these invaluable quotations from precious novels, and let us come to our main matter.\nThey placed before you a family whose bodies may not be covered in blood, but whose world has been shattered; this family is called the Güran Family. They have a ringleader, a cruel village headman: Salim. He is not a Jesus Christ, yet — just as Jesus advised his apostles eager to stone a prostitute — he is as guilty as the one among us who must cast the first stone, meaning he is as guilty as all of us, as innocent as all of us. The greatest crime of this headman, who has been stoned by nearly the entire pure and spotless total of 85 million people, is said to be the messages he deleted to cover up the sex workers he slept with and a few illegal electricity dealings — and, of course, the “DNA taken from a strand of hair fallen from Narin,” allegedly found on the right rear seat when the entire Narin family got into the headman’s car on their way to a wedding. Whether or not you are familiar with what we previously wrote, let us repeat the most crucial point: how this whole affair became a tangled mess and how it ultimately turned into a 14-page document called an indictment. Let us examine once more what happened. As we have written repeatedly, everything began with a fabricated, baseless gas station lie about Salim Güran in a Facebook post. In that post were Narin’s mother, the blanket, the front seat, the car, and of course Salim. This entire storm of lies was built upon that, Honorable Judges; the source of the lie “Narin saw something and was killed” is that Facebook post, which drove an entire country into this mental blackout through the media. In fact, in Nevzat’s first statement — the very same Nevzat whom the media wrapped delicately in cotton as the real likely murderer — you can see these exact core details from that post. In his panic, the first thing Nevzat clung to was this Facebook lie. When the crime scene investigation images surfaced recently, our clever public exclaimed, “This man is too stupid; he couldn’t have killed this girl!” As if killing and burying an eight-year-old girl is something an intelligent person would do — I truly cannot grasp the logic. In any case, while everything was this clear, the Prosecutor did not do what a legal professional should have done and instead tossed the matter to you.\nThis indictment clearly relies on Nevzat’s latest statement, yet it does not even dare to admit this. The reason for all this timidity is obvious, for the Prosecutor seems to have chosen, as a cunning escape route, not to base everything on the words of a liar full of blatant contradictions. Naturally, the Court will ask the Prosecutor: “You accepted everything Nevzat said, yet why did you not write ‘murderer’ when he said ‘murderer’?” Honorable Court Panel, I hope you show a bit of reproach to this Prosecutor who tries to shift responsibility onto you to escape the media’s wrath. I am very curious about what answer he will give: Will he say, “We cannot trust all of his statements, but I had no choice except to present some of Nevzat’s accusations to you as an indictment in order to save myself”? Or will he say, “Be clever like me, hand down the sentence and send it to the Court of Cassation, enough of this dragging on”?\nAccording to the Prosecutor’s indictment, Salim Güran informed the gendarmerie that the Roma had mentioned a red car — supposedly to secretly expose Nevzat. He supposedly committed such foolishness without caring that he might be implicating himself! His going back and forth to the stream right beside the village was also considered suspicious. If they searched for the girl, it was a crime; if they did not search, it was also a crime — what else were these “diabolical yokels” supposed to do? Did you, by chance, have any suggestions for them during the search? Forgive me, I forgot: on the third day, villagers were actually prohibited from participating in the search. Yet according to the shabby media, of course they were not eager to search for the child they allegedly killed! In a village surrounded by a stream and an irrigation channel, could there be any place more plausible to look for a missing child? What crime did the Prosecutor perceive in the occasional visits of the village headman and the head of the family to these places? I leave that judgment to you.\nIt is also sufficient to look merely at the statements of the mother and Enes to see how hollow the idea of an organized murder is; neither of them is speaking in Salim’s favor — they have said whatever they know. Enes and Nevzat describe Salim as almost their commander, indeed nearly their servant-master; so what exactly are they trying to protect of Salim’s, Honorable Judges?\nMoreover, in this indictment based solely on Nevzat’s statement, is there any reasonable explanation for the sentence sought for Enes? Is the Prosecutor truly claiming that eight-year-old Narin was more sensitive about honor than a 20-year-old male youth?\nThey say human memory is afflicted with forgetfulness. Shall we take a look, Honorable Judges, at the chain of lies that has collapsed one by one over the past three months:\n\nThe gas station allegation — debunked.\nThe claim that the sandal belonged to Narin and the mother was misleading — debunked.\nThe allegation that the carpets were washed — debunked.\nThe allegation that they used button phones as a precaution — debunked.\nThe allegation that the imam was involved — debunked.\nThe allegation regarding the “Is the girl dead or alive?” voice recording — debunked.\nThe a burner SIM card allegation — debunked.\nThe allegation that the accomplices misleading the gendarmerie were six years old — debunked.\nThe allegation that the family member working at the State Hydraulic Works continuously increased the water flow so the body would decompose faster — debunked.\nThe allegation that there were cameras in the houses and they hid this — debunked.\nThe allegation that Narin was Salim’s biological daughter — debunked.\nThe allegation that Narin’s DNA was on the front seat and the steering wheel — debunked.\nThe allegation that the village was a Hezbollah village — debunked.\nThe allegation that ammunition was found in the village — debunked.\nThe allegation that Salim misled the gendarmerie and never mentioned the red car — debunked.\n\nLet us close the topic of this boundless chain of lies with a personal anecdote: one day, a friend well aware of my preoccupation with this matter sent me a message: “See? You kept desperately defending the family, and now CNN TÜRK is breaking news: ‘According to the forensic report, the death fluid from Narin’s throat got onto Salim Güran’s hand, and from there onto the steering wheel…’” Yes, Honorable Judges, they said exactly this — they invented a new term for forensic literature, and to provoke the foolish masses, they called it “death fluid”… Death fluid…\nI am inviting you not to conscience or mercy, but to your true duty — the task to which you owe your livelihood and your entire being — that is, reasoning, in other words, intellect and discernment, more concretely, the law. And I want to ask you this question: if the body of this delicate child had been found not after 19 days but after 2 days, and if the media’s ratings-driven and social media clowns’ engagement-hungry fantastical scenarios about the village had not existed, and if Nevzat had given this statement — would you have believed him?\nA thief confesses to burying a bag full of stolen jewelry and tells you, “I didn’t steal what’s inside; someone else stole them and asked me to hide the bag,” and would you act as though you believed this merely to avoid the wrath of media buffoons?\nOn November 7, you will surely witness a commotion, an unprecedented uproar in front of the courthouse — countless vehicles with antennas, around 50 bar associations that have joined the invitation to lynch the family under the pretext of representing rights, law, and justice, perhaps numerous messages from ministers on your phones, various kinds of clownery — an unparalleled chaos. Do not say, “Well, all these people, all this media — they can’t all be fools; of course we must listen to the voice of our noble nation.” Yes, so many people can be mistaken — they always have been, and they will continue to be. I hope I am not pressing on your nationalist nerve, but I quote Ali Nesin: “Ninety percent of Turkey believes that sixty percent of Turkey is stupid.” As I said, there is no need to take offense; Turkey’s ignorance and foolishness, though delayed, have also appeared in now-just societies a century ago. The best-known example for you is the Dreyfus Affair. They taught you this at the very beginning of your education — I am writing this letter with that assumption in mind. If, in the future, when this cautionary event is taught in communication and law faculties, you do not want your names to be included, then I kindly ask you to continue reading this letter in good faith.\nI implore you, Honorable Judges, free yourselves from the captivity of manipulative questions; there is no murder network masterfully covered up, no organized evil expertly concealed.\nOn a scorching afternoon, in a central village of Diyarbakır, a Savage took a little girl who was joyfully skipping past the front of his house; in that stillest moment when the cicadas lull a person into drowsiness, he strangled her, buried her in that cursed stream, and placed stones over her — that is all that happened. Saying “I don’t know” is not the same as cunningly hiding what you know, Honorable Judges; sometimes we truly do not see, do not hear, do not know.\nThe law cannot function based on “What will people say,” Honorable Judges; you do not wear that robe to keep your back warm!\nUnfortunately, in Turkey today, there also exists a monstrosity of social media that has slipped into the hierarchy of the judiciary, and you have recently witnessed this uncontrolled madness; this unhinged, hysterical herd has even had graves opened — that is how powerful they are. Now, so that our esteemed ministers are not subjected for a few days to the lynching of this deranged clan of monkeys, you may be pressured into issuing decisions you do not believe in and do not wish to render. Your situation reminds me not only of Pontius Pilate but also of the character Kaymakam Halil Hilmi Bey in Reşat Nuri’s work, who was subjected to the bullying of the cruel Unionists; in enduring every kind of humiliation, Halil Hilmi Bey would take refuge in the couplet:\n\nIf I were on my own, I would never bow to the cruelty of fate;\nbut in this ruined household, I have a family I must provide for.\n\nOf course, the children and family members waiting at home cannot be dismissed lightly; however, conscience and justice cannot be confined within this narrow couplet either, Honorable Judges. Yours are children and family members, but so are everyone else’s. And rest assured, fulfilling the requirements of the law will not bring disastrous consequences upon you; if there is a city more Kurdish and further east, it would be Kermanshah in Iran — they are certainly not going to send you there. If you say, “You cannot deceive us with such things; we do what is easiest for us,” be assured that after doing so, you will be honored with a few days of exaggerated praise from the base and contemptible elements of social and conventional media. “Behold, the great Turkish justice has manifested, long live our judges!” they will say. But do not be overly proud; when the same people later see a survey concerning trust in the judiciary, they will not hesitate to mark you as 90% untrustworthy. This rotten case, built upon the rumor that “Narin saw something and was killed,” will thus be closed from your perspective — you will not have brought trouble upon yourselves. Everything will be that easy, done and over.\nBut there is also the difficult path — allow me to describe it. In the passage we quoted above, where Turkey’s greatest living writer Orhan Pamuk refers to the vile murderer, there is one more sentence spoken by the victim: “I see now that my life was nothing but a light stretched between two darknesses extending into eternity…” Yes, Honorable Judges, that is what we call life. If you are believers, perhaps for you that light continues; in any case, doing something unjust within this eternity — setting aside whether it is moral or conscientious — is, in my view, not even a wise act for the sake of our earthly comfort. If you say, “We have rendered many decisions, this means nothing to us,” I am not convinced. I do not believe you have ever faced a case as sharp as deciding between aggravated life imprisonment or acquittal for a mother whose child was murdered in a barbaric way; this is not a dilemma to be taken lightly. And do not deceive yourselves by saying, “We will issue this decision, Yargıtay will fix it anyway.” Years pass, hearts stop in prison cells, brains bleed, organs turn cancerous — countless calamities await the convicted… This is not a burden one can shoulder. I am not even counting the viran lives of those outside.\nAnd if you still insist on doing as you please, and wish to please the base, ignoble vulgarity of social media and the media, know this: those charlatans will find another spectacle to trample on three days later, but the shadow of the moral burden this matter brings upon you will continue to envelop your life. This injustice will appear to you like a misplaced ghost — sometimes as a repulsive fly landing on the cheese at a Sunday breakfast table, sometimes bursting forth like a whale from the water at the moment you are on the verge of finding peace while gazing at the sea. For years, whenever it comes to mind, you will lament, saying, “If only we had fulfilled the requirements of the law on that day,” and you will grieve. If anything resembling peace and happiness exists on this earth, know that nothing is a more insurmountable, lasting, or unyielding obstacle than pangs of conscience. Ten years pass, twenty years pass — everyone forgets, but you will remember; you will begin your sorrowful tale with, “Once, in a village of Diyarbakır, on an August afternoon, a little girl was killed…”\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Even in the Diyarbakır 8th High Criminal Court’s reasoned judgment, a coherent narrative explaining how the murder was committed cannot be established; it is explicitly acknowledged that the motive for the murder could not be determined. Moreover, the court could not answer the question of why Salim Güran, instead of taking the body himself and hiding it in the stream, handed it over to Nevzat Bahtiyar—thereby sharing a very important secret that still remains unknown.\nIndeed, the President of the 1st Criminal Chamber of the Regional Court of Appeal, who dissented from the Chamber’s decision to uphold the verdict, particularly emphasized that the motive and manner of the murder could not be determined. The President listed the legal deficiencies in the investigation and prosecution in 14 points.\nThe point that struck me most in the President’s detailed dissenting opinion was his emphasis that “according to the new situation that emerged after news and discussion content in social media and TV bulletins, there were changes in the defendants’ statements.” The President had clearly observed the media’s influence on the trial through the statements."

    "text": "The truth: There was no such gas station employee; the account was fake\nAfter Nevzat Bahtiyar was caught, in his first statement to the prosecutor on 9 September, he said that Salim Güran had shown him something wrapped in a blanket inside the car and told him, “You will dispose of this,” and that he had seen Narin’s body in Salim’s vehicle and taken it from there. He even repeated this during the camera-recorded “scene reconstruction.” These statements were consistent with the “gas station employee’s” social media post! Even though in his second statement on 10 September he recounted different details, he still claimed he took the body from the car.\nBut in his 21 September statement to the prosecutor, Nevzat Bahtiyar completely changed his account of taking Narin’s body from Salim’s vehicle:\n“Salim Güran called me. We went together to Arif’s house. I saw Narin Güran lying motionless on the ground. After placing her in a blanket, Salim Güran handed the body to me. I took the body into my arms, left the house, and carried it to my residence to put it in my vehicle.”\nHis claim that he took the body from the family’s home overturned his earlier narrative and erased most of his first two statements.\nIt is unknown whether this change in statement was related, but shortly afterward it emerged that the Facebook account of the so-called “gas station employee” was fake, that no such employee existed, and that the information shared was false. On 2 October, reports[6] confirming this were published.\nThe court accepted as true Nevzat Bahtiyar’s final statement—repeated during the hearings—that he took the body from the house, first carried it to his barn, put it in a sack, and transported it by his own vehicle to Eğertutmaz Stream. Thus the court concluded that Narin was not killed in uncle Salim’s vehicle and her body was not transported with that vehicle.\nNevertheless, relying on Nevzat Bahtiyar’s assertion that “there was a frothy liquid in Narin’s mouth,” the court reasoned that this liquid might have gotten on Salim Güran’s hand and that he might have wiped his hand on the seat. Salim denied this “absolutely” and said, “It would be normal for Narin’s DNA to be found in my vehicle; I would be surprised if it wasn’t. It is the family car.”\nYet the court’s reasoned judgment stated, “It is clear that after Narin was killed, either Narin herself or an object that came into contact with her body was transported with Salim’s vehicle.” The court thus based its decision not on evidence but on assumption. The President of the Chamber, who dissented from the appellate decision, also emphasized that the investigation on this point was incomplete.\nAlthough the blanket was never found and the “gas station employee” turned out to be fake, the reports published before Narin’s body was found—“Horrifying allegation from gas station employee! Was she lying unconscious in her uncle’s vehicle?”—contributed significantly to the perception that uncle Salim Güran and the family were guilty."

    "text": "The truth: There was no sexual relationship between the uncle and the mother\nNevzat Bahtiyar repeated in court his allegation that Narin was killed because she witnessed a relationship between Salim and Yüksel. But the allegation must not have been very convincing, because the presiding judge reminded him that the time when Narin was last seen on the path leading home was close to the time Nevzat arrived at the home and asked, “When did Salim have time to have relations with Yüksel for Narin to have seen it?” Nevzat answered, “I don’t know. I did not see it.” Salim and Yüksel Güran both vehemently rejected the allegation as “slander.”\nIndeed, the court’s reasoned judgment stated that “it has been concluded that defendant Yüksel did not have a relationship with defendant Salim at the time of the incident.” However, the court still accepted Nevzat’s account as true and rejected Salim Güran’s defense as false. This acceptance was based on the court’s conclusion that “defendant Salim made this statement to defendant Nevzat to conceal the real motive for killing Narin together—a motive that our court has also been unable to determine.”\nThus the court concluded that Salim Güran committed the murder to conceal a motive “more important” than a “sexual relationship” with his sister-in-law Yüksel but, somehow, entrusted the task of hiding the murder to Nevzat Bahtiyar. Yet the court could not identify this very important “real motive.”\nThe President of the 1st Criminal Chamber of the Diyarbakır Regional Court of Appeal, who dissented from the appellate decision, found the court’s decision “contrary to reason, logic, the ordinary flow of life, and the patriarchal structure of the region.” He stated: “More important than whether the relationship between Yüksel and Salim was seen or known is the question of what the real motive for killing Narin was. No conclusion has been expressed within the scope of the evidence, and the conclusion and reasoning reached in the form of mind-reading based on abstract assumptions is unlawful.”"

Contrary to what news reports claimed, the hospital’s death report stated that there was “no suspicious condition or sign of trauma” in her death and that she died during treatment, which is why no autopsy was performed.\nThus, the scenarios claiming that Tülin Güran was killed by being pushed down the stairs collapsed. Yet these reports also played a significant role in intensifying suspicion toward the family.\nReports about Tülin’s death also surfaced during the hearings. When questioned by the judge, Yüksel Güran said her daughter was born disabled and complained about the accusations:\n\n“Police officers blamed me for Tülin’s death; why did Tülin die? If Tülin had not passed away at Dağkapı Hospital, I swear they would have exhumed her grave. ‘You killed your daughter Tülin.’ Everyone knows it; there is a report, thank God.\n‘You threw Tülin down the stairs; what kind of mother are you?’ In that station they interrogated me about Tülin. In this case they portrayed me as guilty. I was in the holding cell; someone came and shook his finger at me: ‘Look, I’m going to Dağkapı. If your daughter did not die there, your life is over.’ They went to Dağkapı Hospital and retrieved my daughter’s death report. How can there be such cruelty? I lost my daughter 17 years ago.”\n\nNaturally, the court’s reasoned judgment did not mention Tülin Güran’s death at all, because it clearly had no criminal aspect. Some outlets that published the false reports did not even bother to correct them; the uncorrected errors remain in digital archives."

The program’s host, Didem Arslan Yılmaz, attempted to correct the mistake on her 28 August program by replaying the mother’s remarks.\nYılmaz said: “RTÜK does not want the word cigarette to be used. Tobacco is interpreted as illegal substance or drug in the region. No, sir, he is smoking a cigarette. It is not an illegal substance; it is tobacco.” Yet despite Yılmaz’s efforts, reports and commentary claiming Enes used illegal substances continued.\nOlder brother Baran Güran was also asked about this on Kanal D’s “Neler Oluyor Hayatta” program on 29 October. Baran Güran said that Enes “had never smoked a cigarette in his life and that this was shown in tests conducted” [14].\nBaran Güran later repeated this in court. During the hearings, the lawyer representing the Ministry of Family and Social Policies, Elif Aslı Şahin, asked, “Did Enes have a tendency toward violence or substance use? Have you ever witnessed an anger management problem?” Baran Güran replied, “Absolutely never. I can state this clearly. You may ask the whole village. Enes is someone who never fought with anyone.”\nDuring his own testimony, when describing how his mother called him while he was smoking that day, Enes was also questioned on this matter. The Presiding Judge asked, “Was it marijuana or a cigarette? In Diyarbakır, marijuana is also called ‘plain cigarette.’” Enes replied, “No, we were smoking cigarettes.”\nLater, at the third day of the hearing, the Presiding Judge said, “I just received a message. A report on Enes has come out. It is negative,” announcing the report[15]. Thus, the allegations that Enes Güran used illegal substances were definitively resolved. The reasoned judgment did not mention the allegation at all."

Suspecting that the Kurdish phrase “ne mıre” had been mistranslated, the Diyarbakır Bar Association requested a new expert analysis[16].\nOn 20 September, Anadolu Agency reported the new translation conducted by the expert. According to this, the phrase “She’s not dead yet” did not exist in the Turkish translation of the Kurdish conversation. Ramazan was actually saying, “One of them is on the ground, haaa,” and Salim responded, “Okay, I will go and get it now.”\nThus the correct translation emerged, but reports about the phrase “She’s not dead yet” in the phone call continued for about a week. Moreover, most media outlets did not even correct their false reports afterward…\nThis phone call was also addressed in court. After playing the Kurdish recording again, Diyarbakır Bar Association President and intervening lawyer Nahit Eren asked: “What did you mean by saying ‘Pick up the thing of yours that fell down there’?” Salim Güran replied, “We usually hide that illegal (electric) device under the bushes near the rocks there. That may be it; nothing else. What else would I tell Ramazan?”\nUpon this, Nahit Eren said, “So this conversation is not about Narin. Now that we have clarified this…” and moved on to another topic.\nThus, it was definitively established that the phone conversation was not related to Narin, and that the phrase “She’s not dead yet” had never been used. The judges did not even dwell on this conversation. The reasoned judgment did not mention it at all."

She answered: “I did not wash the carpets. But because people were coming and going to the house, as far as I remember, on the fifth or sixth day my sister Yasemin came and asked whether I had clean carpets because they were dirty. I said I had. Yasemin took the clean carpet and laid it down. My old carpet is still in the house unwashed.”\nIndeed, halktv.com.tr—which on 7 October claimed to have found images proving the carpets were washed—corrected its report[17] three days later with a new story titled “The mystery of the carpets on the balcony in the Narin murder unraveled!” stating: “It has been determined that the carpets seized by the gendarmerie were not washed, and that this finding matches mother Yüksel Güran’s statement. It was stated that the carpets were taken from the house shortly after the incident and that no washing traces were found on them.”\nA forensic report from the Van Gendarmerie Criminal Laboratory stated that only one carpet sample had the DNA profile of a male and that no findings related to Narin were detected.\nIntervening lawyer Nahit Eren argued that the presence of the DNA of only one person was proof that the carpets had been washed. Eren said: “Thirty-seven carpets, kilims, rugs were taken from the house, some were taken while still laid out. Of the samples taken from those 37 carpets, DNA belonging to only two individuals was found! Wouldn’t they contain hair?” Nevzat Bahtiyar’s lawyer Adnan Ataş expressed similar views.\nEnes Güran’s lawyer Mustafa Demir also argued that the gendarmerie did not conduct a thorough examination, saying: “They only checked with blue light, because they were looking for blood or bodily fluids. They did not find any other DNA. They clung to this idea: The carpets were washed, so nothing remains. Who told this to the press? Again the gendarmerie, I claim.”\nYüksel Güran’s lawyer Doğuşcan Kurucu argued that the forensic report showed “the carpets were not washed and no external intervention was detected.”\nWitnesses also did not confirm that the carpets had been washed, but most importantly, there was no concrete evidence proving that the carpets were washed. The claim remained only as an assumption in the media archive."

Indeed, she was tried in the other case with 16 defendants for this reason. The court ruled that “her statements regarding the hours when the incident occurred were made to protect Enes Güran by saying he was sleeping” and that “her statements were made to conceal the truth about Narin’s murder,” sentencing her to 3 years and 6 months in prison.\nEnes Güran’s lawyer also objected in the appellate application to the court’s rejection without justification of Hediye Güran’s statement, which contradicted Nevzat Bahtiyar’s account.\nAdditionally, it was never confirmed that Enes took three showers that day."

    "text": "The truth: Footage of older brother Baran Güran at a DEM rally surfaced\nIt was incorrect to associate the broadcast ban with Hezbollah and weapons. Because the broadcast ban imposed on 29 August was lifted on 9 September—the very day these Hezbollah allegations began to spread widely.\nIt was also false that “numerous weapons belonging to Hezbollah were found” during searches in the village. No such information appeared in the case file, nor did any further news emerge in the media confirming this claim.\nWhat is true is that, in the early days when the gendarmerie was searching for Narin, during their search of Arif Güran’s barn, they found 380 AK-47 Kalashnikov long-barrel rifle cartridges wrapped in towels and hidden inside hazelnut cream containers, transparent plastic tomato paste buckets, and white flour sacks [25]. A criminal investigation was launched under Law No. 6136 on Firearms regarding the illegally held ammunition. In court, Salim Güran also repeated that 380 bullets had been found.\nThe “32.Gün” documentary on Hezbollah was not filmed in Narin’s village. Teyit.org determined that the documentary was filmed in Yolaç (Susa) Village in Diyarbakır’s Silvan district [26]. The name of Yolaç Village appeared in the documentary; in one frame, the mosque’s signboard was visible. There is an 87-kilometer distance between Tavşantepe and Yolaç.\nThere is no information or document showing that Tavşantepe Village is fully under Hezbollah/HÜDAPAR influence or that the majority of villagers belong to the organization. HÜDAPAR officials also stated that the village was not theirs.\nWhile DEM initially adopted an approach linking the murder to Hezbollah, this stance shifted in the following days. DEM Diyarbakır MP Sevilay Çelenk said, “If you look at the family’s photos, you can clearly see from everything that they have no connection with Hezbollah.” Çelenk evaluated that “rumors such as Hezbollah, counter-guerrilla, village guards, etc. were criminalizing Tavşantepe and its residents” [27].\nIn the elections in Tavşantepe, HDP was the leading party in 2015, İYİ Party in 2023, and AKP in the 2024 local elections [28]. In the last election, AKP received 100 votes, DEM 32 votes, and HÜDAPAR 16 votes [27]. This shows that the village is not politically homogeneous to the extent that had been suggested.\nSalim Güran also said in court that he had no problems with political parties, and that during the days when Narin was being searched for, they “expelled DEM’s meal truck from the village because journalists were following them.”\nMoreover, it emerged that Narin’s older brother Baran Güran had shared footage from DEM Party rallies on social media. Following this, pro-government media outlets such as Takvim[29] and Yeni Şafak[30] published stories titled “Narin’s brother Baran at DEM demonstrations! The spiral of silence in Tavşantepe and the DEM Party factor” and “Footage emerges showing that Narin’s brother Baran Güran is a PKK sympathizer.”\nIn conclusion, no concrete information or documents were produced showing that either Hezbollah/HÜDAPAR or DEM had dominance in the village. The court’s verdict and the appellate decision also contained no references to political organizations in the village. However, these reports and comments influenced journalists and the public to align themselves in the Narin Güran murder case based on their own political positions."

Moreover, Nevzat Bahtiyar did not go to the gendarmerie by himself or request anonymity; he was arrested.\nWhen the gendarmerie identified that a red vehicle had gone to Eğertutmaz Stream at the time Narin disappeared, they first suspected not Nevzat Bahtiyar but his son. When they went to the son’s home in Çarıklı, they found Nevzat there. Nevzat Bahtiyar surrendered, saying, “The person you are looking for is not my son, it is me. I guessed that you would eventually come to me.”\nAfter being caught, Nevzat began talking. But even though his later statements contradicted his first statement, the media mostly continued to label his statements as “confessions.”\nOf course, at that time there were also a few journalists—including Barış Terkoğlu and İsmail Saymaz—who did not agree with the widespread “confession” narrative and said that Nevzat’s statements “did not make sense.” After the first statement emerged, İsmail Saymaz said on Halk TV: “There are inconsistencies in Nevzat Bahtiyar’s statement. There is a self-exonerating aspect to it. There must be a substantial reason for a person to take the body of someone killed by another person and bury it in the stream. The village headman has been detained for ten days. Why did he stay silent? Why did he not speak? What are you afraid of? I think this person actively participated in the crime.” However, the trial did not proceed in this direction.\nAdditionally, the claim on A Haber during the hearings that “there is a new secret witness” and that his statement would change the course of the trial also proved to be false. Immediately after this claim circulated, the presiding judge announced during the hearing: “There is no secret witness statement submitted to our court” [35].\nHowever, Abdurrahman Şimşek—who presented the “new secret witness” claim—did not issue a correction regarding his report[36]. Even the report published on Sabah’s website remains there in its incorrect form."

At no stage of the investigations did any situation arise in which he “confessed to the murder.”\nIt is also not true that mother Yüksel Güran admitted that she had deliberately sent Narin, who did not want to go to the Quran course, to the course. On the contrary, Yüksel Güran stated that she did not want to send Narin to the Quran course that day, and that she could not refuse Narin because Narin insisted on going.\nWhat is more, interestingly, in the two interviews[38] that Yüksel Güran gave to Ferit Demir two days after Narin disappeared—the first on the balcony of the house and the second in the living room—she also said that Narin had insisted:\n\nI saw that Narin was dusting the television. Suddenly, her eyes went to the clock. She said, “Oh,” she said, “I forgot the Quran course.” It was her first time going too… I said, “My daughter, don’t go, it is hot, the course is already over.” She did her finger like this, “The imam gives four hours, we still have time. Mother, I beg you. When I leave the course, I will go to my uncle’s,” she said.\n\nWhat the mother said on camera was also summarized in Halktv.com.tr’s report titled “In her first interview, the mother had signalled this to Halk TV!” [38]. Furthermore, in her statements to the prosecutor and in court, mother Yüksel Güran also recounted that Narin insisted on going to the Quran course, just as she had said in front of the Halk TV camera on 23 August. In court, she described the conversation she had with her daughter at that moment as follows: “I said, ‘My daughter, don’t go. It is hot, don’t, don’t.’ I could not persuade her. She persuaded me. She got up and went, I told her: ‘Alright, my daughter,’ she screamed. She was very happy.”\nNo other information or testimony emerged proving that the mother’s statement that “it was Narin herself who wanted to go to the course” was untrue. The interview Ferit Demir conducted with Yüksel Güran on 28 August focused on the issue that “Narin would not get into a stranger’s car” [39]; her going to the Quran course was not discussed[38]; therefore, Yüksel Güran’s account regarding going to the course was always the same."

In the footage of his statement to the prosecutor on 10 September, when asked about the size of the stone, Nevzat Bahtiyar opens his hands to both sides to indicate the size, and when the prosecutor asks, “Was it 15–20 kilos?” he confirms with a nod.\nThere was also no mystery in the “three stones” issue. The problem stemmed only from how the statement was taken at the prosecutor’s office and how the words were recorded in the transcript. Nevzat Bahtiyar’s words were recorded in the statement transcript as follows: “I put a stone on it so that the sack would not be found by someone. The stone weighed around 15–20 kilos. There were also stones on each side. I did not put brushwood on it. It was already covered, and there was brushwood next to it.”\nWhen the footage of the statement is watched, it becomes clear that Nevzat Bahtiyar carried one stone and placed it on Narin, but used the two stones at the sides to conceal it further. Since the brushwood covered it immediately, he did not feel the need to put additional brushwood on top.\nHowever, at the trial, Bahtiyar also stated—as in his third statement to the prosecutor on 21 September—that he “left only one stone” and did not remember the brushwood on top. Yet the Gendarmerie’s Crime Scene Investigation reports do not confirm Bahtiyar’s statement. In the reports reflected in the investigation file, it was stated that there were three large stones and brushwood on the sack containing Narin’s body found by the stream, and that these stones weighed 30, 25 and 20 kilos.\nAt the hearing, the prosecutor did not dwell on this discrepancy in Nevzat Bahtiyar’s statement. After Bahtiyar said he had “left only one stone,” the prosecutor continued his questions as follows: “Alright, according to you, Salim Güran goes to the place where the lifeless body of our daughter Narin was found at 22:44 in the evening by giving some information and from camera footage. You mention one stone or 2–3 stones, don’t you? There is extra brushwood left on the lifeless body, could Salim Güran have done this?” He replied, “I have no idea, I did not see it.”\nThe prosecutor then reminded Salim Güran of Nevzat Bahtiyar’s words and asked him, “Are you the one who added the remaining two stones and the brushwood?” He also denied this by saying, “Absolutely not.”\nThus, the issue of the three stones was not fully clarified at trial, but the panel of judges must not have seen it as suspicious, as the number of stones was not emphasized in the reasoned judgment.\nHowever, whether it was one stone or three, it was clear that, as Nazlı Çelik said, “these stones were not too big for one person to carry.” It was understood that Nevzat Bahtiyar could carry stones of this weight by himself. After all, he is a plasterer, works on construction sites, and had been able to carry Narin, who weighed approximately 25 kilos, on his own from the car to the stream bank without difficulty."

The footage, which became part of the case file, was also watched in court.\nShepherd Ahmet Akgün, who was seen being pushed and shoved in the footage, was heard at the hearing as a witness. Ahmet Akgün, a cousin of Nevzat Akgün, recounted that Erhan Güran had asked him, “Did you see anything?”, and that he replied that he had not seen anything, that he had been with the animals all day anyway. Ahmet Akgün said, “I said I had not seen anything. They got angry and beat me, although I was not guilty. Then they apologized.”\nUncle Erhan Güran also said, “We gathered so that if anyone knew anything, they would speak. If it were secret, we would not have gathered under the camera.” Speaking in line with what Ahmet Akgün had said, Erhan Güran stated that they asked him, “Did you see Narin?”, that when he said “I did not see anyone,” they reacted by saying “Do you go home with your eyes closed? You are lying,” and that the young men took him to the back. Regarding the beating, Erhan Güran said, “There was no excessive beating. That is, he may have been slapped once or twice.”\nThe course of the trial showed that the gathering in front of Erhan Güran’s house was not “secret” and that they had gathered not to cover up the murder, but to find information about Narin’s disappearance. It was confirmed by both parties’ statements that shepherd Ahmet Akgün had been interrogated by being asked “Did you see Narin?” and beaten."

    "text": "AUTHOR\n\n\nFaruk Bildirici\n\n\nLAST UPDATED\n\n\nJune 4, 2025\n\n\nSOURCE\n\n\nOriginal Source\n\n\nReading Time\n\n\n~ 10 min\n\n\nWord Count\n\n\n1661\nThe village of Tavşantepe in Diyarbakır had turned into a TV studio; instead of reporting concrete findings, some journalists entered a ratings race by conveying rumors and their own judgments. The predominant view in the media, which poisoned and influenced the judicial process, was that mother Yüksel, older brother Enes, and uncle Salim Güran had committed this murder.\nIndeed, the court also ruled in line with the expectations of the public opinion created by the media; family members Yüksel, Enes, and Salim Güran were sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment for the crime of murder, while Nevzat Bahtiyar was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison for the crime of “destroying, concealing or altering evidence of a crime.”\nUnfortunately, not only was this decision of the Diyarbakır 8th High Criminal Court insufficiently questioned in the media, but journalists also stepped aside with the comfort of having completed their duties. They showed little interest in last week’s appellate decision affirming the verdict and passed over it with small news items.\nYet the 1st Criminal Chamber of the Regional Court of Appeal had reached its decision by majority vote, and the president of the panel had attached a detailed dissenting opinion. In most media outlets, including AA, AHaber, Akşam, Cumhuriyet, Halktv, Ekoltv, Hürriyet, CNNTürk, İHA, Sabah, Sözcü, Nefes, Türkiye, and Yeni Şafak, this information appeared only between the lines.\nAmong the newspapers, only Milliyet printed the presiding judge’s dissenting opinion in a separate box. As far as I have seen, only Tele1[2]’s news site published the full text of the dissent, which was reported in detail by DHA[1] and Serbestiyet.\nIt is apparent that the President wrote the dissenting opinion, which is longer than the text of the judgment, after carefully examining all the evidence, statements, and reports in the file. The first point that caught my attention in the dissent was his emphasis that, “According to the new situation that emerged after the news and debates in social media and TV bulletins,” there were changes in the defendants’ statements. The President had clearly observed in the statements the influence of the media on the trial.\nThe President lists one by one the legal shortcomings in the investigation and trial, the contradictions between the reports, the ancillary evidentiary nature of the narrowed base station reports, the failure to determine the motive and manner of the murder, and the deficiencies and errors in the conviction.\nAfter examining the dissenting opinion[2] published on Tele1 under the byline of Ersin Eroğlu, I recalled the concern I had felt during the process that began with the disappearance of Narin Güran. What if all or some members of the Güran family are innocent? What if we journalists also negatively influenced the judiciary and led to innocent people being convicted? These questions pained my conscience…\nIn fact, I had already fallen into the same concern about the court’s decision after reading DEM MP and communication scholar Sevilay Çelenk’s article published on Bianet, “We owe Narin the truth: How did events turn against the Güran family?” article and then her interview[3] with Gökçer Tahincioğlu on T24, as well as Esra Arsan’s piece “From earthquake reporting to the murder of Narin Güran, the exposed state of a journalism: The Ferit Demir legend (!)”[4] and the interview[5] in which Ferit Demir responds to the criticisms. These texts also contained striking observations that members of the Güran family might be innocent and about the media’s mistakes.\nNow, to the questions raised in those articles have been added the legal objections emphasized in the dissenting opinion in the appellate process. The necessity has arisen to reopen this file, to examine it with journalistic cool-headedness, to pursue the evidence. If even one of those convicted, with our contribution as well, is innocent, this is a huge responsibility, a heavy burden on the conscience…"

    "section": "Mind-reading based on abstract assumptions",
    "text": "Mind-reading based on abstract assumptions\nThe President of the 1st Criminal Chamber of the Diyarbakır Regional Court of Appeal begins his dissenting opinion by emphasizing the principles of “presumption of innocence” and “in dubio pro reo” (“the benefit of the doubt goes to the defendant”). Most importantly, he concludes regarding the court’s conviction decision that “without expressing a conclusion based on the evidence in the file, the conclusion and reasoning reached in the form of mind-reading based on abstract assumptions is unlawful.” Without looking at whether it would be in favor of or against the defendants, he lists, one by one and in careful language, all the legal issues he has identified in the court’s decision; moreover, the appellate decision approved by the other two judges does not contain answers to the President’s objections.\nThe President’s 16-page dissenting opinion, which includes the view that the court’s decision should be overturned “for the reasons identified as being unlawful in terms of incomplete examination, legal qualification of the offense, proof, occurrence and acceptance,” will significantly ease the work of the panel that will examine the file at the Court of Cassation stage. The sections summarized from the dissenting opinion below show that the judge is trying to conduct a cool-headed legal assessment by stepping outside the influence of the media:\n\nIt was not taken into consideration that there are contradictions between the narrowed base station report and the farm camera footage, which constitutes conclusive material evidence, and Nevzat’s statements regarding the occurrence.\nAs it is seen that in both reports (Prof. Labudde and Ulusal Kriminal) sufficient enhancement could not be achieved and that there are contradictions between the two reports regarding the dark figure resembling Narin, I am of the opinion that it is not possible to render a decision based on these two reports.\nIt is unlawful to render a conviction against Nevzat for the offense of concealing evidence of a crime, on the basis of the narrowed base station report, which contradicts the occurrence and concrete evidence and needs to be supported by other evidence, and his contradictory statements, while accepting that the act of killing is not proven with respect to him.\nConsidering the existing state of evidence regarding Yüksel and Enes, it is necessary to assess in what manner their participation in the alleged offense occurred and what the legal classification of the offense should be.\nIt is not established that there was a prior criminal decision taken concerning the killing of Narin before the incident.\nWith respect to what the real purpose was for killing Narin, which is more important than the relationship between Yüksel and Salim becoming known, no conclusion has been expressed within the scope of the evidence; the conclusion and reasoning reached in the form of mind-reading based on abstract assumptions is unlawful.\nConsidering Nevzat’s statements that he received Narin’s lifeless body from Salim, it is unlawful that the question of whether the act of killing directed at Narin was carried out personally by Salim was not discussed in the reasoned judgment.\nIt is unlawful that, as a result of incomplete examination and by attributing the quality of conclusive material evidence to the narrowed base station report, which can only be accepted as ancillary evidence and does not allow for judicial review, the acts of Yüksel and Enes were deemed proven and judgment was rendered accordingly.\nApart from Nevzat’s allegation that “Salim Güran told me ‘I killed this girl because she saw that we were together with Yüksel’”, no concrete evidence has been presented regarding these claims.\nIt is unlawful that a decision was rendered without considering, within the scope of concrete material evidence, whether the crime scene was the driver’s seat of the vehicle used by Salim and whether the act of killing was carried out personally by Salim alone.\nIt is understood that, during the hearings, attempts were made to obtain the witness’s knowledge regarding matters not acquired through the five senses, and that the court panel, counsel, and attorneys acted contrary to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CMK) by asking questions containing commentary that would not contribute to revealing the material truth, without complying with the rules of cross-examination."

    "text": "The abuse case in Beylikdüzü\nI do not know whether you remember the news report “Allegation of abuse of a 2-year-old child in Beylikdüzü”; the judicial process regarding the murder of Narin Güran and, most recently, the appellate decision reminded me of that incident.\nThat report, published on Bianet about three years ago, was based on a doctor’s account, a hospital report, and the fact that the Büyükçekmece Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office had launched an investigation. But later, the Forensic Medicine report did not confirm the allegation of sexual abuse; the investigation was closed.\nWhen examining the report amid the ensuing debates, I had stated that the hospital report could not be disregarded and that, with the data at hand, the “newsworthiness of the allegation” arose, but I had also considered it a shortcoming that the family had not been interviewed. I had written that it was not the report but the allegation that had turned out to be wrong.\nLater on, I thought a great deal about this assessment. Over time, I came to the conclusion that I had not sufficiently taken into account the pain of the family subjected to such a serious accusation. Until the allegation was clarified, the family members were subjected to an accusation of sexual abuse; they could not even experience the grief of their deceased child. Now, when I think of their situation, my heart aches.\nThe lesson I have drawn is this: following up on an allegation of sexual abuse – especially if it is directed at a child – is important, but it is also important to obtain the views of all parties, to use careful language, and to respect the family’s grief.\nIn the murder of Narin Güran, if even one of the family members is innocent and we, as journalists, have caused that innocent person to be convicted, this would be an unforgivable journalistic offense. We are faced with a duty to find answers to the questions left in the dark, to ensure that the legal problems in the case are resolved, and that the murder is fully clarified in all its aspects.\n\n\n\nExternal References (5)\n\n\nDHA: The murder of Narin Güran; the sentences given to 4 defendants upheld ↩︎\n\n\nTELE1: Ersin Eroğlu: Sentences upheld in the Narin murder: Dissent from the presiding judge ↩︎\n\n\nT24: Gökçer Tahincioğlu: An opposing view on the murder of Narin Güran from DEM MP Sevilay Çelenk: There is no such thing as a ‘family murder whose motive has not been found’, I expect acquittal at appeal! ↩︎\n\n\nESRA ARSAN BLOG: From earthquake reporting to the murder of Narin Güran, the pitiful state of a journalism: The Ferit Demir legend (21 February 2025) ↩︎\n\n\nJOURNO: Semra Pelek - We spoke with Ferit Demir, whose reports on Narin Güran were criticized: “It was not good that I wrote the name of the arrested child in full” (17 March 2025) ↩︎"

This report, which appeared on DW Turkish, was used by many sites in line with their own style (some of them even made it a “gallery,” that is, they put one or two sentences under each photo with many photos). The report included the following information:\n\nDNA found on the driver’s seat of the vehicle used by S.G. matched the DNA samples taken from Narin Güran’s clothes and blanket. This development made the uncle a suspect.\nIn addition, it was determined that uncle S.G. left the village quickly 15 minutes after his niece Narin Güran was last seen with her friends.\nThe gendarmerie teams also examined the phone of the detained uncle. As a result of the examination, it was determined that S.G. had deleted WhatsApp messages and calls from his phone.\n\n\n\n\nA Facebook message posted by a fake Facebook user named Murat Çınar Çatalca.\n\n\nThe journalist who accessed this information was one known for doing their job well, and it was natural for the report to be shared, but the Facebook post contained parallel content and, because it featured a kind of story, a scenario, it spread in an unbelievable way in a short time; now, with this information, let us look at the Murat Çınar Çatalca post sentence by sentence:"

    "section": "Reference to the 28 August Post",
    "text": "Reference to the 28 August Post\nThe following part in the first sentence of the text takes us to the “family and uncle relations are a bit complicated” expression in the X post shared on 28 August from a very strong account with 9 million followers:\n\n“In the HTS records there are both messages and call logs with Narin Güran’s mother before and after the incident.”\n\nIts immediate continuation, however, overlaps with the information in the report on DNA published the same day:\n\n“… on the day of the incident 15–20 minutes after Narin disappeared Salim Güran left the village quickly in his own vehicle, he doesn’t even get fuel, he enters a gas station, he buys wet wipes from the market.”\n\nThe news sentence in the report may not be particularly striking due to its dryness, but it is obvious that it will be highly striking within a narrative, because it is not only reported that he left, it is also stated that he left quickly. Moreover, the supposedly factual detail that he bought wet wipes from the market has a special importance, as very few expressions could better convey that he had done a dirty job.\nThe fact that the camera footage was given to the gendarmerie commander and would not be given to the media, etc. is not written merely as ornament; these are used as elements to increase credibility, an early answer to the sort of social media question “then why is there no footage”: There isn’t any because the gendarmerie took it, and in fact it is a crime to give it. Another critical sentence in the post that takes us back to the famous account’s statement “family relations are complicated” is this: “This mukhtar was also in contact with Narin’s brother Enes.”"

    "text": "A Timeline Embedded in the Post\nThus, uncle and mother were seated next to the brother who had already been marked as guilty through the dog/cannabis frenzy since 27 August. But the issues in this short post are not limited to these:\n\n“and in the camera footage unfortunately Narin is either unconscious or lying in the front seat strangled by Salim’s hands and there was a dark brown blanket on top of her.”\n\nThe most critical point of this part of the post, as will be discussed later, is not so much that the child is “either unconscious or strangled by Salim’s hands,” but that she is in the front seat. According to the report published the same day, Narin’s DNA sample was found on the front seat.\nThe last sentences are not insignificant either: for those who might ask “would a man carrying a strangled child on the front seat go into a gas station,” the following sentence was written preemptively: “Since the gas station staff also knew the mukhtar there was no doubt…” On the other hand, the fact that he entered the gas station “quickly” and parked the car not in front of the market or at the pump but by the car wash had skillfully inserted suspicion into the text without explicitly stating it.\nThe critical point of the remaining expressions is: “… his phone was off (…) and he returned to the village in the dark 2 hours later…”\nThe information in the post was not only in parallels with the information in the report published and widely shared that day, it was also in special and careful harmony with another piece of information that was not yet known to the public at that time: upon the statement of some children that they had seen Narin at 17:40, law enforcement had focused the investigation around that time, as we later learned. The report said, “it was determined that he left the village 15 minutes after Narin was last seen,” but no time was given for the departure. The post, however, was arranged exactly according to that time, namely the 17:40 information: he comes quickly, buys wet wipes, leaves, and returns in the dark two hours later."

So who made the post? Who could know so many things? Who could hope to gain what from such a post?\nThe post itself does not provide evidence on this, of course, but it gives some clues, some data to think with: the text was written by someone who knows incident reporting, little attention was paid to spelling, but this carelessness may carry the possibility of being deliberate, considering the narrative skill. Incident reporting, and being able to embed subtext into it, is not something that can easily be done by people with no experience in this field. Therefore, the likelihood is very high that this text was written by a journalist, a lawyer, or a law enforcement officer.\nThe fact that the text was drafted in a way that observed consistency with other information (reports and/or posts) that became public between 27 and 31 August is an indication that this was not some kind of trolling activity, something written by a random person just to stir things up—in other words, it is an indication that it could not have been a coincidence.\nThe user named Yusuf Mahir Koçyiğit, who interacted with this post, was both entering the scene in the role of “the wine-seller’s witness is the pitcher-seller” and, with a tone that would prompt and cue aggressive statements against Salim Güran, was triggering those statements.\nThe account named Murat Akkaya became the first virtual personality to extend the issue to the whole family, and also formed one of the prototypes of statements against the family: “For hours I have been threatened with death by Salim Güran’s elder brother, his younger brother, his family and his wife’s family. Threat and insult messages have been sent to me. The owner of the gas station I work at has been threatened.” The Akkaya personality, with phrases like “he was sweaty, tense, panicked” for Salim Güran, and with an equally effective narrative deliberately careless about spelling, such as “he asked for wet wipes, he took three,” or “he first said cash, he checked his pockets, there was no cash, then he paid by credit card, those slips were given to the police,” also managed to increase the credibility of the matter.\n\n\n\nA Facebook message posted by a fake Facebook user named Murat Akkaya.\n\n\nThe reports that leaned on these posts spread rapidly especially after 4 September. In the meantime, some social media users posted that the accounts were suspicious, that they could be fake, but both the “digital public” that had now “found the truth, and that truth along with a good/explanatory story tied to it” and, unfortunately, the journalists, had no time to bother with such things. The public could only learn that the accounts were fake on 2 October, but again, no one went back and corrected their reports, let alone undertook any research into examining the effect those posts had caused and their source."

There is a heading that says 700 friends but when clicked it does not open.\nThere is little info in info: we learn that he is male, born in 1989, and speaks Kurdish and English.\nThere is a favorite quotes section, and there is an answer to it: “Heger em nebin yek, eme herin bı yek u yek..” (I did not touch the spelling.)\nIs there a connection between this user and him? Is this a real user but the post that stirred things up was fake? It is not possible to know. Not for us mortals, at least; but in an ideal judicial process, should all the means not be mobilized to find out who made such a strange, critical, and openly investigation-related post/posts? Is the Turkish judiciary’s capacity for examining digital matters limited to “Fake, opened from abroad” findings? Are not all public institutions, including universities and companies, obliged to provide the judiciary with the information, equipment, and research facilities they possess when necessary? Even if the accounts were opened from abroad, the information is highly insider.\nI will continue, we are still on 31 August."

In the report, there was also a perspective indicating that the post had similarities with the statements given by Nevzat Bahtiyar, who had by then been arrested. However, in my opinion, the relation with those statements is a different matter, I will return to that in later sections, the truly important aspect is that it was in harmony with the information and developments between 27 and 31 August, and that it later determined the direction of the reports and was treated almost as a case/information that pre-approved the developments.\nIn his work The Media’s 12 Mistakes Faruk Bildirici also discussed this case in detail. Because Brother Faruk is a polite person he called them mistakes, whereas a very significant part of these are nothing but professional misconduct.\nOne of the people who had addressed the issue earlier was also Rana Polat Sönmez. The relevant section in Rana Polat Sönmez’s article[2] deals with the issue of time in a different way but in a way that produces the same result, and also uses an important detail about Güran’s vehicle in a meaningful way:\n\nThe investigations revealed that the accounts in question were fake; there was no such gas station and no such employees as claimed. Moreover, for Salim Güran to have left the village, stopped at such a gas station and returned, did not fit into the time interval of the incident.\nDuring the first hearing, Nevzat Bahtiyar was asked whether he had seen these posts; he replied, “I did not see, but I heard.”\nHowever, there was a common aspect between these posts and Bahtiyar’s statement that pointed to material evidence: it was consistent with the DNA data detected in Salim Güran’s vehicle. What was interesting was that these posts were published on the day the DNA detection was made. Moreover, the posts gave the impression that they were aware of the investigation’s scenarios. Mother Yüksel Güran and brother Enes Güran were being pointed to, and the communication traffics, which we frequently heard from the media and which are now understood to be baseless, were mentioned. As for uncle Salim Güran, a scenario was constructed based on the image of him leaving the village at 18:55.\nCarrying a corpse in the front seat was not an ordinary thing either, but someone who knew Salim Güran’s vehicle could put forward such testimony only in this way; since the rear windows of the vehicle were tinted.\n\nABOUT THE TITLE: THE DISINFORMATION REVOLUTION\nThe Information Bomb is the title of a book by the French thinker Paul Virilo. Based on the atomic bomb, “Just as the radioactivity of the components of matter made the atomic bomb possible, so does the interactivity of the components of information…” makes this bomb possible.\nThe book, which deals with striking theses such as modern science’s departure from its philosophical foundations and taking different paths, states that today the mental analogical approach is steadily fading, and instrumental and numerical approaches are taking its place. “Unlike in the past, science, which now depends on effectiveness rather than truth, is being dragged towards its own collapse, towards a civilizational degeneration.” (Paul Virilo, The Information Bomb, translated by Kaya Şahin, Metis Yayınları)\nIf we put media instead of science here, the sentence becomes more suitable for these writings. The situation of the media is too bad to be described merely by the word bad, even the word degeneration may remain an innocent expression.\nWhile saying, “Following the atomic bomb, which shattered matter with radioactive energy, at the end of the millennium there emerged the specter of a second bomb. This bomb is the information bomb that, through the interactivity of information, has the power to shatter peace between nations,” Virilo, in line with the themes of the book, is mostly thinking of international issues and the course of the world. Yet his highly prescient book also helps us understand today that not only peace between nations but also peace between societies, peace within societies, and increasingly society itself is being shattered.\nThe book also contains observations that will help us understand what has been happening around the Narin Güran case, both as media and as society, it is possible to say that we are floundering beside the usual technical problems of communication, in the frightening traps brought about by instantaneous commenting, Virilo says: “These precursory signs show that the real information revolution is in fact the virtual disinformation revolution.”\n\n\n\n\nExternal References (2)\n\n\nHABERTÜRK: Mustafa Şekeroğlu - The Impact of Fake Accounts in the Narin Investigation: Striking Similarities Between Baseless Posts and Statements (02 October 2024) ↩︎\n\n\nHALKWEB: A Candle for Narin Güran II: A Blind Faith, an Invisible Suspect, Three Stories (06 September 2025) ↩︎"

    "title": "The Narin Güran Case #2",
    "section": "First Silence: Be Quiet, The Judiciary is at Work!",
    "text": "First Silence: Be Quiet, The Judiciary is at Work!\nLet’s begin then: there are two crucial forms of silence in the judiciary. The first is the silence necessary to conduct investigations and prosecutions properly. The second — which took on a special dimension in the Narin Güran case — is the “silence of the family members (even the entire village), allegedly concealing the crime,” an accusation that quickly became a presumption, thereby erasing the presumption of innocence itself. The first rule of silence was violated by almost everyone — the media, bureaucracy, politicians, and social media users — especially after August 31, 2024. As for the second kind of silence, a large chorus formed — led by lawyers and politicians — in which the presumption of innocence and its natural extension, the right to remain silent, were utterly disregarded. Indeed, all emphasis on the family’s silence could only exist by ignoring these principles — and that is exactly what happened.\nSilence is vital for justice. When judges demand silence in court, it is not only to maintain physical order in the courtroom. In the judiciary, silence is a necessity — it allows the case or investigation to reach a clear and fair conclusion by ensuring that speech occurs only within prescribed procedures and at appropriate times. It is an unwritten principle. The secrecy of investigation exists to secure this silence at the highest level and essentially means: “To prevent anyone outside the investigation authorities from interfering with the process, documents, or information; and to ensure that those authorities protect these with utmost care.”\n\nThe tension between silence and the right to information\nThere is a natural tension between this requirement of silence and the right to access or share information. It is true that judicial or political authorities often abuse this principle — one reason why the public instinctively reacts against secrecy in legal matters. Yet such abuse does not invalidate the principle itself. The balance between respecting confidentiality and ensuring public access to information — like justice itself — must be reestablished in every case. Each stage of justice, each procedure, requires constant inquiry, consideration, discovery, and a sense of responsibility. Judicial authorities (including political ones) must strive to rebuild this balance in every instance, creating mechanisms that respect the public’s right to know, while also explaining when patience and restraint are required. Ideally, these mechanisms should be managed and supervised by the prosecutor’s offices conducting the investigation. Every other authority that speaks out effectively opens a breach in this principle of silence.\nJournalists, too, are bound by these rules. When they access information related to an ongoing investigation, they must evaluate it carefully rather than automatically publishing it. They must ask themselves: Where does the public interest lie — in keeping the information or in sharing it? Perhaps it should only be conveyed to the investigators? Verifying the authenticity and clarity of the information is an obvious prerequisite. A crude example: if the information reveals that judicial or political authorities are obstructing justice — in a country where enforced disappearances, unsolved murders, and paramilitary violence are not relics of the past — then, of course, it must be published. But if its publication risks helping the perpetrators escape, destroying evidence, or misleading both investigators and the public, then silence must prevail. This requirement applies from the reporter’s first contact with information through every stage of editorial decision-making.\n\n\nThe crime scene is not a stage\nAnother implication of this rule is that crime scenes — places of examination or investigation — must remain calm and isolated enough for proper work to be done. In the Narin Güran case, this principle of silence and calm was never respected. From the second day onward, countless journalists, politicians, and lawyers flocked to the village. Broadcasts were made constantly — by everyone from individual content creators to national TV channels. The Güran family’s homes were flooded with visitors. Of course, the public nature of the case would inevitably draw media attention, and the presence of lawyers and politicians might have seemed understandable at first glance. Yet it is impossible to claim that most of them respected the principle of silence. Quite the opposite — everyone who went to the village sought to talk, to collect and spread information, and to share details about the investigation itself in real time, without any filter. Those who didn’t go made up for it by spinning theories in studios or at editorial desks, while others simply copied and republished whatever fit their narrative.\n\n\nTurning grief into spectacle\nWorse still was the distortion of information as it spread. The “Dog/Abuse/Cigarette/Marijuana” incident discussed in the previous section was the first of many such examples. The issue with that so-called “dog incident” was not merely that Yüksel Güran’s words were professionally distorted — the very format of those interviews and talk shows poses serious ethical problems. When the subject is a judicial process — especially one involving a child’s disappearance or death — there are strict journalistic norms: do not casually interview or publicly broadcast statements from grieving relatives; do not publish their words without verification. At this point, the typical counterargument appears: “Then why did the mother go on TV?” When institutions and individuals are involved, accountability must begin with institutional failures, not personal ones. Grieving people cannot be expected to know when to speak or remain silent, what to say, or how their words will be interpreted. Even when they are entirely innocent, they are vulnerable — desperate. Reporters, editors, and producers, however, are obliged to know better. Thus, the fault lies not only in the distortion of words but also in the very act of repeatedly putting Yüksel Güran on television. That alone was a serious act of irresponsibility. Judicial and political authorities, too, should have taken preventive measures — not by imposing bans, but by warning family members about the potential harm of such exposure and ensuring that public communication followed a disciplined procedure. This is, and always has been, essential."

    "section": "Second Silence: The Right to Remain Silent and the Presumption of Innocence",
    "text": "Second Silence: The Right to Remain Silent and the Presumption of Innocence\nThe second issue of silence arose from a claim that appeared very early — and quickly became a major source of noise: “The family knows something but remains silent. The mother knows but remains silent. The village knows but remains silent.” After Nevzat’s arrest on September 8, 2024, this silence turned into a presumption. Party leaders, human rights defenders, lawyers of all kinds, experts, analysts, and theorists began making speeches, giving interviews, and writing articles — all feeding this presumption with passionate conviction. This presumption of silence obscured another silence: the right to remain silent of those accused.\nThe popular saying “silence implies consent” effectively nullified the criminal law principle that silence is not an admission but a right. What is this principle? The right to remain silent rests on the presumption of innocence. It is the duty of investigators and prosecutors to find sufficient evidence to prove guilt. The constitutional guarantee that “no one shall be compelled to testify against themselves” is the ultimate affirmation of this right. Otherwise, coercion becomes normalized. One mechanism that protects both the presumption of innocence and the right to silence is the prohibition of pre-judgment (ihsası rey). If justice is a process of investigation and deliberation, and judges must evaluate evidence freely according to conscience before reaching a verdict, they cannot signal that verdict beforehand. Doing so negates the presumption of innocence. Although this rule applies specifically to judges, in truth — like silence itself — it concerns everyone: no one has the right to declare another guilty before due process is complete. (The violation of the presumption of innocence intensified after September 8; I will return to this in later sections.)"

    "section": "First Leak: Blood on the Rocks and the Governor’s Statement",
    "text": "First Leak: Blood on the Rocks and the Governor’s Statement\nWe can now turn to three separate incidents that publicly broke the silence in the Narin case.\nThe first seems simple: the “blood on the rocks” incident. The other two foreshadowed the storm after August 31 — unlike the dog incident, these now involved the judicial authorities themselves: the detention of Enes Güran (due to bruises on his eye and bite marks on his arm), and the arrest of uncle Salim Güran following reports that “DNA was found in his car.”\nLet’s begin with the blood on the rocks. Until August 28, the press had not produced much news. Reporters wandered around the village, interviewing locals, asking why the search was taking so long — while others reassured, “Be patient, answers are coming.” The first news-like report claimed that blood traces had been found on rocks near the Güran family’s home. Before the reports spread, the Diyarbakır Governorship issued a statement on August 25, the key part of which read:\n\n“It has been observed that news and posts have circulated claiming that blood stains found on rocks near the home of missing child Narin Güran belong to her. It was determined that the stains resulted from a neighborhood child’s nosebleed.”\n\nTwo points are clear before we move on: Who provided the information that blood was found and being examined? The police, of course — meaning there was already an internal leak, a breach of confidentiality. Second: why did the Governor’s Office feel the need to issue a statement? Initially, it gave the impression that official information would henceforth come through the governor, but this soon proved untrue. The statement likely reflected unease about the leak itself."

    "section": "Second Leak: The Bite Mark on Enes’s Arm",
    "text": "Second Leak: The Bite Mark on Enes’s Arm\nFrom the very beginning, law enforcement interviewed many individuals, including family members — not formal interrogations but so-called information interviews resulting in informal notes. In fact, the interview method has no place in Turkish criminal procedure. In its decision of January 14, 2025 (application no. 2020/14678), the Constitutional Court criticized this practice and ruled that statements obtained through it have no evidentiary value:\n\n“Considering that the applicant’s statements obtained through the interview method, which has no basis in criminal procedure, were not confirmed during trial… it is understood that the digital data mentioned in the conviction for membership in an armed terrorist organization, though not the sole evidence, were of decisive importance.”\n\n(Full decision available at: Kararlar Bilgi Bankası[1])\nLeaving aside the legal issues surrounding such unlawful practices, let us stay with the theme of silence.\nLaw enforcement conducted an interview with Enes Güran as early as August 23–24. They noticed a bruise on his eye and later a bite mark on his arm. Forensic photographs dated August 25 confirm this. However, the public learned of his official detention only on August 28, and by the next day, the news had exploded with sensational headlines like “Shocking details emerge”. Enes was released on August 29. Forensic analysis determined that the bite mark did not belong to Narin Güran. Yet this second leak, combined with the earlier “Dog/Abuse/Marijuana” narrative, paved the way for a flood of reports implying Enes was the culprit. Soon, grotesque and baseless scenarios began to circulate — the first being: “Narin saw Enes and his friends harming a dog and…”\nAlthough forensics confirmed the bite mark did not belong to Narin, the reports remained chaotic: most said no DNA was found and the bite didn’t match, yet some insisted the truth could only be confirmed once Narin was located. Almost all mentioned an important detail: Enes had taken three showers, so DNA couldn’t be recovered. Sometimes this was attributed to “publicly available information,” other times falsely cited as “from the Forensic Medicine report.” Meanwhile, experts appeared on TV explaining the significance of bite marks; retired detectives claimed to have solved murders through them. Thus emerged a market for detectives, retired officers, and self-styled criminologists.\nThe following three reports represent the most professionally written among them — yet they share the same fundamental flaws:\n\nSABAH – Was Narin Güran Found? Major development in Diyarbakır disappearance! Forensics confirm: Bite marks on brother’s arm[2]\nGAZETE PENCERE – Major development in missing Narin case: Bite marks on brother’s arm not from Narin[3]\nTAKVİM – Missing Narin case bite-mark detail! Detective comments: I once solved a murder from a bite mark.[4]\n\nDespite these reports, social media quickly escalated matters, claiming “Bite marks confirmed to belong to Narin.”"

    "section": "The Commander and The Minister’s Statements",
    "text": "The Commander and The Minister’s Statements\nThe core issue here was the leaks. At the time, in August, these might not have seemed serious, but by September, unfiltered information from law enforcement to journalists became uncontrollable. As public noise grew, “official statements” — no matter the intent — served as confirmation for emerging theories. On August 28, when we learned that Enes Güran had been detained, the Provincial Gendarmerie Commander announced:\n\n“We have evidence and statements. We tracked Narin’s movements in the village minute by minute. We are following the evidence closely — we are very close to a conclusion. Inevitably, we view this as a criminal case, considering all possibilities.”\n\nThe commander’s statement was essentially a “public relations” effort: search operations had covered 12,565 vehicles and 32,952 people; 47 houses and 22 abandoned buildings were inspected; 78 surveillance cameras were reviewed; 66 people were interviewed, including 8 suspects and 58 witnesses. It was clearly an attempt to defend his team against criticism — explaining how extensive the efforts were. That same day, the Minister of Justice also made a statement, saying there was one person in custody and that all details were being examined, expressing hope that Narin would be found safe.\nTaken together — the statements from the commander, the governor, and the minister — they collectively breached the principle of silence. Yes, public communication is necessary, but when a gendarmerie commander speaks instead of the prosecutor, and both the governor and minister add comments, the risk of distorting the investigation is immense. In a climate where judicial independence carries little weight, such interventions by political and bureaucratic figures have become routine — which only normalizes the problem further. In truth, their words tend to influence public opinion rather than inform it, serving as subtle admissions that the judiciary is not truly independent.\nAmong these three statements, the commander’s was particularly significant: “We are very close to a conclusion. We have strong evidence.” Naturally, this was interpreted as pointing to Enes Güran, who had just been detained. The minister’s statement was seen as confirmation. When uncle Salim Güran was detained on August 31, the implication expanded further. By early September, the Minister’s remarks made the issue even clearer — the political authority itself was hinting at guilt."

    "section": "A Futile Attempt at Silence: The Broadcast Ban",
    "text": "A Futile Attempt at Silence: The Broadcast Ban\nOf course, all these statements were deeply tied to the political climate. On August 24, 2024, DEM Party MP Ceylan Akça questioned the suspicious power outage in the village during critical search hours, saying, “We cannot accept a power cut that could allow potential perpetrators to move freely.” Social media reactions were, predictably, filled with hatred. On August 27, the HÜDA PAR deputy leader visited the Güran family, saying he would maintain dialogue with officials. Within days, that visit was reframed as evidence of the family’s nature, and by early September, the issue had evolved into an outright “Hizbullah connection” narrative — one of the loudest sources of noise.\nIn response to growing leaks, the Diyarbakır Prosecutor’s Office requested a broadcast ban on August 29. The Diyarbakır 5th Criminal Court of Peace granted it the same day. The head of RTÜK (the media regulatory authority) then stated: “The sharing of unverified information and speculation in the media undermines the sensitivity of a case involving a child. We strongly urge all broadcasters to comply with the ban to protect the family and ensure an effective investigation.”\nIn an environment where institutions responsible for maintaining silence either did not exist or were not functioning, this move could not be more than a late bureaucratic plea for silence. Those same authorities who were supposed to safeguard silence were, in practice, violating it. Moreover, the ban itself — given the state’s poor record in such matters — immediately became part of new narratives and fueled new theories.\nLinked to this overture of three incidents, but far more consequential than the others, was a critical development on August 31, 2024, when Salim Güran was taken into custody. A Facebook post made under the name Murat Çınar Çatalca, and the way that post was turned into “news,” caused events to spiral out of control. This incident — along with subsequent reporting and statements about Salim Güran — is pivotal both for this analysis and for the case itself, and it must be examined in detail.\nThat will be the subject of the third section.\n\n\n\nExternal References (4)\n\n\nCASE LAW INFORMATION BANK: Judgement for Helin Yusuf ↩︎\n\n\nSABAH – Was Narin Güran Found?

Human judgment is flawed; no one, not even the most competent judge and the most competent judicial body, is free of error. For this reason it was said: “Do not judge lest you also be judged.” God commands being just; whoever is not just commits oppression and becomes one of the tyrants. Yet He does not say how to be just. Striving for justice is the duty of the human being. There is no ready-made formula for justice; it is always a search, an effort, a field of struggle. Because there is no ready-made formula and because judgment belongs to God, judges do not rule by “truth” or “the absolute fact,” but by their “conscientious conviction.” For the same reasons, every form of adjudication, including judicial adjudication, has been bound to rules and principles; it is subject to developed protocols and specialized methods. Not only the judge, not only the prosecutor, not only the lawyer, but everyone is bound by these rules. Where everyone, relevant or not, acts in violation of the rules, contrary to the principles, indifferent to the protocols, and heedless of the methods, the adjudication performed in that place can produce nothing but oppression. There is no advance justice; even if one complies with all rules a hundred times, when one does not comply once, disaster emerges.\nI am speaking of the Narin Güran case. The case showed that in Turkey the “capacity to adjudicate” is filled with problems so serious and so weighty that they make it almost impossible to reach justice — problems that begin with individuals one by one and extend to the judiciary itself, to politics, to the media, to academia. From the media and politics first and foremost, to the investigative and prosecutorial bodies, various actors emerged as perpetrators of this loss of capacity: Even if the judgment rendered by the court happened to be “correct” by coincidence, everything that led to that “correctness” was faulty, and therefore that correctness could only be an accident; justice cannot be based on accident. Of course, starting with the dissenting opinion written at the appellate stage and the judge who wrote it, there were those who watched out for “the right things” from the day the matter became public, there were those who warned of the errors, but neither those warnings nor that dissent — full of legal knowledge, insight, and insistence — were able to transform the decision from a mere coincidence into a decision reached through a judicial activity aiming at the ideal of justice. Likewise, the decision to overturn the “harboring the offender” case, which forms another bundle of lost judicial competence, displayed a hopeful perspective and a strong grasp of law. But we still do not know whether this “light” and “reasonable speech” will be able to overcome the darkness and noise that have surrounded the case from the very beginning. The howling of the wolves drowned out the silence of the lambs so completely, and there are so many who are pleased with that noise, that one’s hope breaks.\nIn this study I will focus especially on how the media — and soon after, politics — handled the matter starting from the very first day, because primarily what led the whole affair to turn into a “disaster of investigation and prosecution” was the high-decibel noise environment created jointly by the media and politics. Of course, if the subject is the judiciary, the government must be seen as the primary responsible actor in the widest frame; I see it so, because the responsibility for, for example in this file, the obvious and difficult-to-understand inadequacy of the judicial police, which is one of the steps of the judiciary, naturally lies with the government. But before sticking the big needle into the government, there are smaller needles owed to the media of which I am a member, to the law, and to politics as a whole. The fact that journalists do not work in line with journalistic norms, that politics steps in without caring about the ideal of justice, that the “defense,” that bar associations, throw the “presumption of innocence” into the trash and become blind partners to the joint wrongdoing of media and politics — none of this can be excused solely by the government’s flawed media and legal policies.\nThe second aim of this study is to distinguish the shadows that flawed attitudes in the media and in politics have cast upon the investigation and prosecution. Of course, the problems of the judiciary, especially in the investigative phase, will also remain within the frame. Let me note immediately that I will not enter into “evidence discussions,” because that requires another method and another focus; this work, essentially, is not a legal study but a study on the relationship between law, media, and politics. In short, this work focuses exclusively on the malfunctions in how the media, politics, and legal mechanisms operate, and in how they relate to one another. Let me also state at the outset that I am not looking for a “culprit” in these areas, and therefore I will continue, as far as possible, without mentioning proper names, for two reasons: First, it benefits no one to lock the discussion onto the sins or virtues of particular individuals; second, the problem is not personal mistakes but entirely structural, systemic in character."

    "section": "The Reason for the Intense Attention: Concience?",
    "text": "The Reason for the Intense Attention: Concience?\nFirst, we must begin with the intense attention the media and politics showed to the matter. Of course, if a child is missing it is good and necessary that the media, politics, and society pay close attention. But from many similar, very painful, very grave cases that occurred before and after, we know that the way interest in the Narin case spread socially is almost unique. Why? If we say “conscience,” then the scarcity of interest in other matters remains unexplained; conscience is not something that erupts like a volcano now and then.\nOne explanation is that the month of August, when the incident occurred, was “weak in other agenda items.” In the absence of agenda, the media has the ability to create one for itself, especially if what is at stake is the disappearance of an innocent child. But this “truth” is not very sufficient, because the same media that does not bring to the forefront of the national agenda the case of a two-year-old baby whose body cigarettes were extinguished on and who was raped, that is not very eager to report on the barely adolescent “yes-sir boys” who lose their arms and legs in machines at workplaces, that writes “the child laborer killed by his boss” twice and moves on, must also have had other motives underlying its attention to the Narin case.\n\nReason #1: A child coming out of a Qur’an course!\nThe first reason was that the child disappeared after coming out of the Qur’an course. The potential to build a discourse against the government around criminal incidents that occur especially in places where children are present collectively was the first major reason why those who live in the media and social media with the label “opposition,” and of course opposition parties, took close interest in the matter; naturally, the “oversight” function of the media requires this, but the intensity of that interest compared to other cases still needs further explanation.\nUntil the date the child’s body was found, nearly all the reports in “opposition outlets” and in a significant part of pro-government outlets began with the phrase “Narin, who could not be reached after leaving the Qur’an course…” That formula continued to be used for a long time even after the child’s body was found. One of the developments that increased this motivation was the early-stage reports that the village imam was “under suspicion.” These were grave reports: it was recklessly written and broadcast that “pornographic images were found on the imam’s phone,” even that he was a “swinger,” and that this had come up in police questioning. Much later, one journalist finally thought to ask the authorities: the investigation was being conducted not by the police but by the gendarmerie, there were no such images on the phone, and such a question had not been asked; questions unrelated to the investigation would not be asked.\nBoth that lie and the persistent use of the formula “the child who disappeared after leaving the Qur’an course…” had a clear purpose: it is a formula that is supported by, and in turn strengthens, the claim that the government has no priority such as protecting women and children, and therefore in places where children are collectively present, including Qur’an courses, every sort of threat is possible; that there are ill-intentioned people there; that the government is not interested in eliminating those threats. Many media workers, politicians, and jurists sadly see statements and narratives based on these templates as equivalent to “being political,” and they produce and disseminate these statements without scrutiny, without filtering them through criticism, thinking that they are thereby “doing opposition.”\nBut the interest was not limited only to “secular groups absolutely opposed to the government.” From the very beginning other groups also entered in with “special motivations.”\n\n\nReason #2: Hizbullah, the village guard system!\nWhile the Qur’an course issue was still hot, two more claims were released into circulation: the village was a “village guard village,” even a “Hizbullah village,” and bullets and weapons had been found during the searches. These had already reached the rank of “truth,” and thus the stance in the media and social media spread also to opposition parties and civil society organizations. Statements poured down like rain; marches were organized. Thus, just as much as the “secular” segments seeking to oppose the government, those deeply (and absolutely justifiably) disturbed by the terms “village guard” and “Hizbullah,” the region’s lawyers, politicians, and institutions also mobilized to publicize and socialize the issue. If the child of a village and a family that are this intertwined with the state, this close to the state, is missing, then the responsible party must be the state.\nFinding themselves under a two-pronged barrage of criticism, government figures began to try to produce “counter-arguments and counter-statements.” The visit to the village and the family by one of the region’s well-known pro-government politicians, Galip Ensarioğlu, and the words he said afterward made the voices of the two camps that had already risen to their feet grow even louder, and caused many segments of society who had not noticed the matter until that day to begin following it closely. According to his own speech, the reason for Ensarioğlu’s visit was to respond to the atmosphere that had been formed against the government because of the incident and to some of the arguments circulating there. He was going to say that the family was not Hizbullah, but from the Welfare Party tradition, and he was going to emphasize that it was not right for politics to be involved. Indeed, politics should not have become involved, but his own visit and words did not prevent the very thing he criticized; they amplified it. One particular remark would ensure that the outcome was the exact opposite of his intention:\n“There is confidentiality in the investigation. Also we have come to the final stage. There are things that we sometimes do not know, and sometimes know but must not say. Because the family, you know, is our friends. Because the matter is at such a sensitive level, we do not want to say something that will upset them too much. After we reached the lifeless body of our girl Narin, we are about to reach the perpetrators very quickly.” [1]\n\n\nThese words drew intense reactions; Mr. Galip and other government officials stated that his intention had only been to emphasize the confidentiality and sensitivity of the investigation. But these statements had little effect. At the time this explanation was made, 21 members of the Güran family were in custody. Mr. Ensarioğlu’s political intervention under the theme of “not involving politics,” rather than preventing, only cemented the inclinations and convictions that had been forming against the family since 21 August. It is likely that the anti-government tendencies and beliefs formed in the political sphere led to the emergence of the idea of the “family being guilty,” not only among opposition segments but also within government circles. Indeed, the next day Ensarioğlu reiterated the argument that Narin might have “seen something she was not supposed to see,” thereby positioning himself at a common point with that tendency. In fact, in Mr. Galip’s statement there is also an implication of “there may be offenders within the family,” and his aim seems to be to prevent labeling the entire family as guilty.\n\n\nReason #3: Hatred of Kurds!\nIn the early days of the case, that is, in the period up to 25–26 August, those who viewed the matter within the framework of an “opportunity to oppose the government” were active, but after an unbelievable distortion and implausible conclusions drawn from words spoken by the mother, Yüksel Güran, on a television broadcast, “Kurd hatred” also entered into play — sometimes openly, sometimes dressed up in various colonialist discourses. Shares and analyses began to fly around on themes such as feudalism, the tribe-state relationship, the tribe-crime relationship, and the “culture of the region.” (As this article proceeds we will also see examples.) The manner in which Yüksel Güran’s words were distorted also showed how grave the condition of the media is. Through various arguments about the intertwined relations among a reactionary government, its social allies, and the tribal structures in the Kurdish provinces — namely the triangle of “state, religious order, Kurdishness” — the hostility against Kurds was then mobilized.\nBy then, four groups of actors had lined up, using the media and social media, and the media–social media dynamic further fanned their flames.\nThose seeking an opportunity to oppose the government through secular desires.\nThose wanting to conduct opposition to the government on the Hizbullah–village guard axis.\nRacist segments who dress up their hostility to Kurds with right-wing or left-wing arguments.\nAnd, of course, the government and those who seek to protect and defend it.\nAs the first example of the grave role played by the media, let us now look closely at the words of Yüksel Güran on television; if you scan internet sites and social media platforms dated 28 August 2024 and after, you will see the following report/information:\n“The Mother of Missing Narin Güran in Diyarbakır Made a Confession Live on Air: I Didn’t Say It Because They Would Suspect Us.”\nBefore moving to what is written under this long headline, let us look at the headline itself. The word “confession” shows that, from the perspective of those making the report, the mother is assumed to be guilty or to know who is guilty. Because the editor (when we read the story with the headline) takes us to a cluster of suspects: the son who is about to leave for military service and/or his two friends.\nThe sentence chosen from the mother for the headline was specially selected (and is not correct) in order to focus suspicion on the family. The mother has “remained silent until now,” so we have a strong “evidence” that “silence means consent.” Yet under criminal law principles, silence is not used as evidence; silence is a right, and it signifies not “admission,” but “non-acceptance.” Who cares about law? Before the unleashed genius of the journalist-editor, what science — let alone law — could stand?\nNow let us look closely at the report:\n“Narin’s mother Yüksek Güran, on the program ‘Didem Arslan Yılmaz’la Vazgeçme,’ revealed a detail from the day of the incident, saying, ‘I couldn’t say it because you would suspect us,’ and confessed as follows:\n‘The dog ate the turkey, and my son who is about to go to the army and two of his friends were smoking in the back of the house at the time Narin disappeared and were torturing a dog. I said, don’t do it, it’s a sin. I’m saying this for the first time, I didn’t say it because they would suspect us.’”\nHow nice, how convincing, how “evidentiary,” is it not? Of course, these are sentences re-written by “editors,” not what the mother actually said. She does not in fact say on the program, “I didn’t say it because you would suspect us.”\nOn the program she says:\n“I went up to the roof. I laid out my bedding. I saw that Enes was over by the stable, I could hear his voice. I couldn’t see him. (…) I said, Enes, the dog ate my turkey last night. I called out to Enes. I saw that his two friends were there too. I hadn’t mentioned this before, I hadn’t said it first. His two friends were there. I saw (SILENCE) I said, it’s a shame, it’s a sin (SILENCE) The host cuts in saying, ‘They’re smoking.’”\n\n\n(The segment from 34:45 to 35:25 of the broadcast[2]. In the first “Silence” she says “they’re smoking,” in the second silence she says “you’re smoking at this age — your lungs—”.)\nThere is no such thing as torture of a dog. Where did that come from, then? From the phrase “it’s a shame, it’s a sin.” But she is saying that to the young men smoking. What is the confession? Nothing. She says “I hadn’t mentioned this before,” meaning that as she appears on the program and is asked questions, she recounts details and events that come to mind. During the program a journalist sitting next to Yüksel gives information: law enforcement officers have arrived, the program will end, statements will be taken. The same journalist, at the beginning of the segment, recounts that up to that day statements had been taken “for information” from many people including family members “without any detention order.”\nBut of course it did not end there; the invented phrase “torture/abuse of a dog” quickly turned into “rape of a dog” on social media, and the word “cigarette” turned into cannabis. Two days after the first broadcast on 26 August, that is after the spread of the “cigarette into cannabis” and “torture of a dog” claims, the program host took up the matter again, effectively correcting and refuting reports that were not her fault but had been attributed to her program; she stated that there was absolutely no mention of cannabis or any illegal substance, and that RTÜK had fined them for the utterance of the word “cigarette,” which is why that part had been muted.\nWhen I compare the words I took from the program to the sentence in the published reports, the following is seen: the editors have made the sentence discursive, in order for it to “have effect,” whereas Ms. Yüksel speaks in fragmented phrases. But if they took it as she spoke, it probably would not “have effect.” There is nothing to justify the word “confession,” which they placed in the headline. There is no such thing as cruelty to a dog. Also, the mother does not say “my son who is going to the army, Enes”; because she knows which son is going to the army — the ones who do not know are the editors! The one going to the army is not Enes, it is Baran.\nWhat is happening here? How can a report like this be made? For people who have no editorial competence, or whose only competence is to value “influencing public opinion” above editorial-journalistic norms, there is nothing abnormal in this. This prototype report spread extraordinarily that day; it was used mostly by copy-paste. No one bothered to watch the program. Those who did this were not only small news portals; the websites of two quite serious outlets, Cumhuriyet[3] and Karar[4], ran the report without using the word “confession,” but with an emphasis on “detail,” while still preserving “abuse of a dog” and the phrase “I couldn’t say it because they would suspect us.”\nIf we also add the social media users who further distorted the so-called facts in the report (“I’m not saying ‘troll,’ because in this process countless ordinary users behaved like ‘trolls’”), it would still be difficult to estimate the impact produced.\nAfter this report, “enemies of Kurds” became perhaps the loudest contributors to the noise that had formed around the matter.\nThe effect of this report lasted quite a long time. In fact, she had said neither “torture” nor “abuse,” but what does that matter? This report and the clamors that followed led (again) to Enes Güran being questioned as the first candidate offender in the killing. Drug tests showed no cannabis or any narcotic trace, but we did not see any headline in any newspaper such as “Major mistake, Enes did not smoke cannabis.” Far from seeing that, even as late as around 16 September, professors on television and “successful detectives” were still explaining the importance of the dog scenario. Of the scenario that did not exist.\nThis has gone on too long. I will cut the introduction here. I will publish the second part in a day or two. Thank you for your patience.\n\n\n\nExternal References (4)\n\n\nSÖZCÜ TV: “There Are Things We Know but Must Not Say” — AKP’s Galip Ensarioğlu’s Words About Narin Spark Outrage (09 September 2024) ↩︎\n\n\nDİDEM ARSLAN YILMAZ’LA VAZGEÇME: Episode 908 (26 August 2024) ↩︎\n\n\nCUMHURİYET: Mother of Missing Narin Spoke, Saying “I Have Never Mentioned This Before”: Broadcast Was Abruptly Cut After Her Statements!

On that day, uncle Salim Güran, who was also the headman of the village, was taken into custody; the news reported that “suspicious DNA,” or DNA belonging to Narin, had been found in his vehicle. It was an extremely critical day, especially because of a post that a Facebook user named Murat Çınar Çatalca made that same day. That post would set the direction of both the media and social media and, it seems, of the case file itself. A month later it turned out to be fake, and afterward almost no one cared about it anymore, but it had two important features: First, it used some information that at that time was not known to the public but was known to those conducting the investigation (and to the lawyers, journalists, and politicians in contact with them); second, it laid the foundation for the “the family is terribly guilty” theory that would survive all the way to the judgment stage."

    "text": "The Father’s Complaint: Don’t Hurt Us on Social Media\nBefore getting to that critical day and that critical post, we need a few more notes in order to understand the atmosphere between 27 and 31 August 2024; some of these may sound repetitive, but their importance will become clearer as we proceed. That day, Arif Güran (the father) would say he would file a complaint[1] about humiliating news and posts:\n\n“They call in the headman (that is, Salim Güran) for a statement, they call me in, they call her mother in. Why this slander? If my son is guilty, if I am guilty, that’s something for the state to know. We’re waiting. They said the same about my son. They said the teeth marks were Narin’s, that’s a lie.”\n“He is the village headman; can’t he go and give a statement, or go in for someone else, or go for his own statement? We are waiting just like you. We can’t sleep anyway, we can’t drink. Our minds aren’t even with us. Don’t hurt us on social media.”\n\nWhy was Arif Güran complaining? A theory was slowly taking shape on social media (under the effect of statements given, leaked information, and the highly flawed reporting of those statements and leaks), and posts accompanied by harsh accusations against the family were starting to circulate. As early as 27 August, even if not yet in newspapers, social media had already begun to fill up with heavy accusations against Enes Güran and thus against the family. The number of users who were sure that Enes Güran and two of his friends “smoked weed” and even more sure that they had harmed a dog (at first it was mistreatment, then it became torture, and finally it was said to be rape) was increasing at a steady pace. The door had been opened to direct insults against the family."

    "text": "She Saw Something She Shouldn’t Have Seen\nThe argument “Narin saw something she shouldn’t have seen” was also first voiced on social media: the oldest trace of that phrase on social media goes back to 28 August; an account with not many followers and apparently choosing to remain “anonymous” wrote the following:\n\n“A journalist on NTV identified the person. Someone very close. I think Narin saw something she shouldn’t have seen. I hope I’m wrong and Narin is found.”\n\nThe leaked procedures and information about Enes and the theories of these zealous champions of conscience were simmering day by day, moving toward becoming the “general public perception” on 31 August and afterward. The false claim that Enes and his friends “hurt/raped a dog” was showing signs of being merged with the campaign against government proposals about stray animals, and people were being called to the rally to be held in Yenikapı on 1 September 2024. The formula “Narin saw something she shouldn’t have seen” spread rapidly especially after Salim Güran’s arrest on 2 September, and would become virtually the essence and summary of the whole affair. Now, in order to approach 31 August day by day, it is useful to look closely at some critical posts:"

These types are extremely dangerous, mark my words. The geography will sell anything, abandon anything, just to save its own skin.”\n\nThe post was dropping the first hint of the arguments that would later, in September, be deployed by orientalist and colonialist masterminds, with the word geography.\n\n\n2. Who Did the Mother Fear So Much That…\n27 August, from a respectable account with 11,000 followers, which would receive 2.3 million views:\n\nAnd the mother… She spoke on air about a detail that may change the course of the investigation: “I’m saying this for the first time, I didn’t say it because I thought they’d suspect us. At the hour when #Narin disappeared, her older brother and two of his friends were behind the house smoking tobacco and they harmed a #dog. I said son, that’s a sin, have mercy…” After these words, in the interest of the integrity of the investigation — which is how it should be — the mother’s voice was cut from the broadcast and it was announced that the gendarmerie had called her in again to give another statement.\nIs the ‘tobacco’ she mentioned marijuana?\nFrom her lament “Son, have mercy,” what are we supposed to understand? That they ra**d the dog?\nWho/what was the mother afraid of that she didn’t include this detail in her statement?! Time is running out, and when the pieces come together, the picture that emerges tears my heart apart! A village of 20 households! 7 days, just 7 days!! But don’t look at me, child… Still we keep hope alive. I’m saying, just come back! #FindNarin #WhereIsNarin #Apocalypse #WhereAreYouNarinGüran\n\n\n\n3. A Person Who Kills an Animal Kills a Human\n28 August 2024, a post:\n\n#1EylüldeYenikapıdayız #narin This fiend (referring to the person who assaulted and killed the child named Eylül Yağlıkara) raped an animal; if he had been jailed for that, he wouldn’t have preyed on Eylül. A person who kills an animal will kill a human. A person who rapes an animal will rape a human. Know this, shape the law accordingly, and protect our children… Don’t release perverts and killers…\n\nThis was a low-follower account with little engagement, but the post it quoted from 27 August had received 6,000 likes, 1,000 reposts, and more than 400,000 views.\n\n\n4. What They Did to the Dog Cannot Be Ignored\n\nRecall that the killer of little Eylül (referring to a victim in another case) had previously ra**d a dog! Don’t forget! What the brother and his two friends did to the dog, which the mother said she kept silent about because “they’d suspect us,” also cannot be ignored. #Narin #WhereIsNarinGüran\n\n\n\n5. Those Who Encourage Killing Dogs… Are Instigators\nPost dated 28 August, one of the attempts to link animal rights activism to the case:\n\nIf the killer of Narin turns out to be the BROTHER who TORTURED and RAPED a dog, Those who CAUSED this torture and rape, Those who say the streets will be safe only if there are no stray dogs, Those who ENCOURAGE KILLING dogs and thus pave the way for killing people, THEY ARE THE INSTIGATORS OF THIS MURDER!!!\n#SokakHayvanlariSahipsizDegildir #1EylüldeYenikapıdayız\n\n\n\n6. A 9-Million-Follower Account: “THE FAMILY AND THE UNCLE, IT’S ALL A BIT MESSY”\nThat same day, from a very famous and philanthropic musician’s account with more than 9 million followers — which, compared to others, was “relatively” mild:\n\nAhbaplar investigated.\n#narin\nBite marks were found on her brother’s arm.\nHe said “I bit myself.”\nThe matter has been referred to forensics.\nWe’re waiting for the result.\nThe family and the uncle, it’s all a bit messy.\nThe authorities are also looking into this special situation.\nThere are inconsistencies in family members’ statements.\n\nAs one would expect, it got 8 million views, 52,000 likes, 5,000 reposts, and over 2,000 replies, mentions, etc.\nOne feature of the post was that it showed not only journalists and lawyers but also volunteers involved in social aid efforts had access to certain information; “the family’s relations are a bit messy,” coupled with “the authorities are also looking into this special situation,” tells us this. Let us note immediately that in the Murat Çınar Çatalca post there are insinuations of problematic relationships between Uncle-Brother and Uncle-Mother; this shows that the fake account holder and certain people around the case were feeding from the same pool of information.\nIn the comments below, the dog theory was voiced, the Minister of the Interior was mentioned, and people were saying things like “poor girl born into the wrong family.”\n\n\n7. Poor Little Girl Born into the Wrong Family\nAnother deep-conscience post from 28 August:\n\nI wish you were alive, beautiful child, I wish they could just take you from that family and protect you, I wish! – Yesterday, her father, a Hüda-Par sympathizer, said “I turned my phone off”! That struck me as odd… And both the mother and the father have always been chillingly cold-blooded! – Today it’s been announced that the brother was detained to collect DNA, and that there were bite marks on his arm. So, despite tırnak marks on his arms from torturing and raping the dog, the brother was detained and then released! And afterwards he says in his statement “I did those marks myself”! The part about the brother hurting the dog, that’s sexual abuse, and of course maybe they killed it afterward! Unfortunately Narin was killed, the most innocent one in the family is gone… What they’re looking for isn’t Narin, it’s her body! In the first hours, if a missing child isn’t found, the chance of finding them alive is next to zero. The moment she disappeared they should have taken the entire family in! Her father, her mother, her brother, all of them! Poor missing little girl born into the wrong family! As for everyone left behind — including the crying wailing mother — may you all rot in hell! #WeAreLookingForNarinGueran #WhereAreYouNarinGüran\n\nOne million views, seven thousand likes, and more than 650 reposts.\n\n\n8. Educate Your Sons First, Not Your Daughters\n\nSo it all starts not with sending them to Quran courses, but with teaching morals to your child within the family. Educate your sons first, not your daughters. That bastard of a brother — even if he didn’t do anything to Narin — should still be prosecuted for that disgusting thing he did to the dog.\n\n\n\n9. The Whole Family Knows the Truth and Is Hiding It\nPost dated 29 August:\n\nNarin’s brother Enes raped a dog that day, Smoked weed, There are Narin’s teeth marks on his arm.\nMost likely Narin is dead and her killer is her brother. The whole family knows the truth and is hiding it..\nFrom the very first moment they gave only partial information. Their facial expressions were more shock and panic than sadness.\n\nThe idea of trying to build a theory by reading the emotional state of the family members — “their facial expressions were more shock and panic than sadness” — was perhaps the most important issue caused by the leaks. Later, both in the publicly available documents of the main case and in the “aiding in concealing the perpetrator” case, we would see that this method was adopted by the investigation/prosecution units themselves.\n\n\n10. A Post\nOn 31 August, a representative of an organization doing work in the public interest issued a warning to comply with the broadcast ban:\n\nRegarding the ongoing speculative posts about Narin, apart from UCİM Chair Saadet Özkan, Deputy Chair Yücel Ceylan, and the association’s National Legal Coordinators and Legal Counsel, we kindly request that no unverified information be published in the name of UCİM by any of our other units; we also state that we bear no legal responsibility in the event of a violation of the broadcast ban.\n\nBut the same person did not see any need to correct or remove their 27 August post “in line with the request not to publish unverified information”:\n\nThe mother has started talking!! The brother who’s about to go to the army and his two friends were behind the house at the time Narin disappeared, smoking cigarettes and harming a dog. The mother said “I’m saying this for the first time, I didn’t say it because I thought they’d suspect us.” The mother also knows that people who harm animals can’t be trusted. The truth will come out, even if late; just a little longer.\n#WhereIsNarinGüran\n\nIn response to that post, someone with 23,000 followers and respected followers wrote:\n\nTo them, raping a dog is such a normal thing that the woman tells it calmly, and she didn’t even intervene. We’ve been saying this all along, but we couldn’t get it across: I hope you’ve now understood that the thing you stayed silent about today, chalking it up to “just a dog,” will not remain limited to the dog.\n\nNote the emphasis on “them,” which, like the word “geography,” carries the markers of veiled hate speech.\nIn short, at that point the “harm to the dog” lie still seemed “relatively” plausible, but the broadcaster of the program had already issued a correction on 28 August — although who cares, really? Moreover, “the brother who’s going to the army” wasn’t Enes anyway, but does that matter? No one felt like deleting a post that had gotten 4.6 million views."

    "text": "The Detention of Salim Güran and the Accompanying Reports\nWhen Salim Güran was detained on 31 August and arrested on 2 September, one of the claims accompanying this was that “DNA was found in the vehicle.” Nearly all newspapers and online outlets naturally shared the related reports; some (like TRT Haber or DW Türkçe) presented it as their own reporting, some quoted according to their style, some simply went with copy-paste. The “most editorially careful” versions included the following:\n\nDNA found on the driver’s seat of S.G.’s vehicle matched the DNA taken from Narin Güran’s clothes and blanket. This development made the uncle a suspect.\nIt was also determined that the uncle, S.G., left the village quickly 15 minutes after Narin Güran was last seen with her friends.\nGendarmerie teams also examined the uncle’s phone. As a result of this examination, it was determined that S.G. had deleted WhatsApp messages and call logs from his phone.\n\nClearly these were gendarmerie-sourced details. The statement “it was determined that he left the village quickly 15 minutes after Narin Güran was last seen with her friends” was rather striking; even more striking was the “interaction” between the post from the fake Facebook account and this information."

    "text": "A Fake News Bomb: Murat Çınar Çatalca\nOne of the incidents whose impact was later forgotten — the way it steered the process overshadowed — was the Murat Çınar Çatalca incident. On 31 August 2024, a certain MÇÇ left striking allegations in a comment under a Facebook post that Salim Güran had made on 15 August. That same day, an account with 300 followers took a screenshot of the FB comment and shared it on X without comment:\n\n#FindNarinGüran #FindNarinNow\n#WeAreLookingForNarinGüran\nThe message written by a man named Murat Çınar Çatalca on the social media account of Narin’s uncle..\n\nDespite the limited follower count, it received 80,000 views, but it took another day or two for the matter to become publicly mainstream. The fact that content shared from anonymous or fake accounts could become mainstream within one or two days is of course partly a result of the catastrophic condition of the media, but on the other hand it raises suspicion that there were people acting with full awareness of that condition. This particular case is the most typical example of that.\nThe public only learned that MÇÇ was a fake account on 2 October 2024, from a report by Mustafa Şekeroğlu at Habertürk. Until then, hundreds of articles and thousands of posts treated what was written under that name as “the absolute truth,” and the content became, for millions of people, the greatest proof of reality. To this post, the lie “blood and vomit samples were found in Salim Güran’s car” was also added."

The allegation was raised that Salim Güran had said to Narin’s father, “I will make you suffer such a pain that you will never forget it for the rest of your life.”\n\nIt was raised — but whether it was true or not was apparently not seen as important. MÇÇ’s statements were also included in the report, of course not forgetting to add the phrase “it was learned that he gave a statement to the gendarmerie.”"

    "title": "The Narin Güran Case #3",
    "section": "A Highly Assertive Report That Contains Its Own Contradiction",
    "text": "A Highly Assertive Report That Contains Its Own Contradiction\nOn the same 4 September, the halktv.com.tr site published a signed, “exclusive”-tagged report[3] titled “This is how the first clue in the Narin case was caught”. The sub-headline stated that Salim Güran had been arrested and said, “Uncle Güran was taken into custody because of a post he made on Facebook.”\nI chose the Halk TV report partly because it was signed — relying both on institutional and personal trust — and partly because it was one of the earliest and most widely cited. Here too, as with the outlets that either quoted or produced their own versions, editorial work was highly limited.\nThe article stated, “First Çatalca’s statement was taken, then Uncle Güran was detained”; it did not say “it was claimed,” “it was alleged,” “it was said,” “it was reported,” “it was asserted,” etc. The writer and the publisher were sure. The situation was definite. But that certainty flipped in the last sentence of the article: “On the other hand, it was learned that the gendarmerie investigating the incident did not take the statement of any person named Murat Çınar Çatalca who commented on social media.”\nIn short, it seems that neither the two outlets I cited nor any outlet that quoted them or produced their own reports had actually opened and looked at the social media post — that is, the FB comment. Nothing about the user had been checked, the oddities in the content had not been scrutinized, it had simply been accepted as true. Until 2 October, when it was “definitively learned” that the account was fake and operating from abroad, there had been a downpour of news, video packages, TV programs, and posts. In another outlet (koza24), the sentence “it was learned that Çatalca went to the gendarmerie and gave a statement” was used confidently. On 4 September, A Haber, in its extensive report[4], featured snippets from the uncle’s interrogation, repeated Çatalca’s allegations without criticism, but did label them as “allegations.”\nYeni Şafak, for example, repeated the “he went and gave a statement” claim on 5 September and turned what he had written into news without any critical filter. Another site (TRHaber) repeated the same things on 9 September; it did not include the detail about “giving a statement.”\nA “brand” like Milliyet, in a 10 September report that also included expert opinions, saw no problem in using the following phrasing: “DNA samples belonging to Narin Güran were found on the front seat of the car belonging to her uncle, who was arrested, Salim Güran. For Salim Güran, a gas station attendant named Murat Çınar Çatalca gave a statement to the gendarmerie saying ‘Either Narin was unconscious or Salim had strangled her with his own hands and she was lying on the front seat, and there was a dark brown blanket on top of her,’ and afterward the uncle was arrested.”\nAfter Nevzat Bahtiyar was caught, on 11 September there was inevitably a report[5] titled “The gas station worker’s statements confirmed what Bahtiyar said”: “The words of a gas station employee who commented on Uncle Salim Güran’s social media account” had, it said, confirmed Bahtiyar’s statement.\nBy now not only the brother but also the uncle and the mother had been included almost definitively in the “guilty” lineup. Now we can look more closely at the content and form of the MÇÇ post; but this is already so long that I will leave that for the next section. In my next section, titled “The content, language, and tone of the information bomb,” (perhaps the most critical part), we will meet again.\n\n\n\nExternal References (5)\n\n\nYENİ ŞAFAK: Father of Missing Narin Güran Spoke About the Detention and Statements: Why This Smear?

    "title": "Narin: The Dark Face of an Era - 2",
    "section": "Erzincan Prison Visit",
    "text": "Erzincan Prison Visit\nOn Friday, July 4, I went to Erzincan Prison to visit mother Yüksel Güran and Narin’s older brother Enes Güran. If I had been able, I would also have gone to Erzurum to see Salim Güran, but I could not fit that visit into the same day, so I could not go there. I had said in the piece I wrote for bianet in February that I would visit Yüksel Güran, but so much happened in between — the intensity of the agenda, health trouble, surgery, etc. It seems fate reserved it for a hot July day.\n\nMeeting with Yüksel Güran\nAfter passing through doors and turnstiles at Erzincan Women’s Closed Prison and entering the area where the open visit would take place, I saw Mother Yüksel from afar. This woman, who is younger than me in age, had completely collapsed since I saw her at the Diyarbakır hearing on December 29; she had become tiny… Salim Güran does not say in vain, “What has happened to our family are the sort of things that, if they fell on a mountain, would crush the mountain.” The moment Yüksel Güran saw me from afar, she began to cry, I walked quickly to her and hugged her like I would my sister, we cried together, and cried…\nIn prison visits you cannot take anything with you. I asked the officers for tissues three times. Honestly, I had never thought I would be so overwhelmed with tears together with Mother Yüksel… I listened to her at length; the first thing she said again and again as we hugged and cried was, “I saw my Narin’s grave.” For the first time in months she had watched television the day before, she had seen Narin’s grave and heard the judge’s request for release. She described it as best as she could.\nI sat with her for maybe two hours. What could I possibly say? I wished her strength and patience as best I could. I spoke of the beauty of the country of those who defend her. She told me about the letters and gifts sent to her. She said she held them and kissed them one by one as if embracing her daughter. She told me about her husband, who along with the children sets out from Diyarbakır at the crack of dawn and returns home in the dark of night, just to see her for one hour a week. She expressed, in her own way, the deep anxiety these journeys give her… I told Yüksel that I would also see Enes, that I would speak to him at length and try to lift his spirits. “Tell him they gave me a television,” she said. She even asked me to tell him that she had a refrigerator, although she did not. She added that since Erzincan is not very hot, she did not really need a refrigerator anyway. “But let Enes think I have a fridge, he’ll be happy,” she said. I told her, “Hold on Mrs. Yüksel, please, please do not let your mind fixate on dark thoughts, try to find something cheerful to watch on TV, once health is gone, it’s gone.” I spoke to a woman who had melted away like a candle about the need to protect her health and about the two little children waiting for her outside…\nYüksel Güran cried and cried, saying, “I couldn’t bring myself to throw away even the strands that fell when I combed my baby’s hair.” I told her about the women who fell captive to ISIS, about the women of Kurdistan who suffered the harshest forms of torment. I do not know why, but I thought that knowing these might help her endure this cruelty. She told me that because she had no other daughter besides Narin, her older sons Baran and Enes helped her with housework and with everything, how kind-hearted and how mature they were. “Enes would bake cake for his little siblings, he would do everything for them,” she said…\n\n\nMeeting with Enes Güran\nAfter Yüksel I went to see Enes. I found him much better than his mother in terms of morale. I think his feelings of anger and revolt have given way to the inner lightness and acceptance that comes from innocence. The fact that, outside, the number of people who believe in his and his family’s innocence is growing like a snowball, and the new evidence and reports that have emerged, have surely helped that lightness and confidence a great deal. For an 18-year-old, he sustained an extraordinarily mature conversation. I also tried, as best I could, to tell him a few things. I wanted to remind him that throughout history, sadly, many people have ended up imprisoned for crimes they did not commit. I told him this would pass, that it absolutely would pass. He told me he was reading books and spoke of the books he was reading. I told him, too, to try to keep his mind away from thoughts that would emotionally wound him. To be patient, even if it is not easy… He said he was exercising, that it helped. I had promised his mother. I hugged Enes tightly on her behalf as well. I hope it helped him feel a little better.\nTo leave Yüksel and Enes behind in Erzincan with such a deep feeling of helplessness was truly very painful. I would very much like, before too long, to visit them one day in their village, in their home, and to plant flowers together on Narin’s grave. These people have suffered so unjustly…"

    "text": "A happy family photo…\nFor example, this observation of mine must never be ignored: just like the mainstream media that could not get enough of spreading lies and sensational information about what happened to Narin, the media we call alternative also imposed a shared embargo on Narin’s family. Until March 29, 2025, there was almost not a single photograph of Narin together with her family, all of them appearing happy, carried in the media. One or two photos of her with her mother did find space in the media, but as you can see in this report[1], those photos were cropped from above Narin’s head height, cutting out mother Yüksel’s loving face as she embraced her, even though Narin’s head only reached her mother’s chest line.\nSince Narin’s height only came up to mother Yüksel’s chest, her affectionate face as she embraced Narin was being cut out. Within what I previously called “the practice of dehumanizing and de-personing the Güran family and Tavşantepe,” there is also this cruel image management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Family Unseen in the Media\nThe first photo with the family suddenly appeared in the media on March 29, exactly seven months after the incident. Before that I had only seen one photo shared on accounts close to the family — in that one the mother was not present; in that photo, where the father and the children’s spotless, bright faces appeared, the media hardly gave it any space. Only family relatives were sharing it on social media. As for the March 29 photo, every media outlet that published it shared the story under the headline “Narin’s last photos with her family have emerged” and mentioned “a striking detail.”\nThat detail, accompanied by a kind of mental blackout, was mentioned in every report that published the photo. The detail in question was that Narin was wearing the same old red sandals on her feet that she was known to have been wearing on the day she was killed. The red sandals were the striking detail! No one said, “How many pairs of shoes did this child even have to wear on her feet such that you see news value in the fact that she was wearing the same pair that day?” Yet what almost everyone leaped over in that photo was the fact that it showed a very happy family, bound to one another with love.\nNo one could say “The striking detail is that this is a very happy family.” When I saw that photo, I immediately thought of Yüksel Güran’s words in the hearing: “We were a happy family.” She repeated this to me several times in prison: “We were so happy…” In order for that happiness to be shown even a little, only eight months after the incident did this video recording[2] from Narin’s last birthday — which you can watch by clicking the link — begin to circulate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Happiness and the Blindness of Sensationalism\nIn the reports about the video, almost reluctantly, mention was made of how Narin runs and hugs her father, how her brother holds back her hair so it will not catch fire as she leans toward the cake, and how the mother says, “I’d sacrifice myself for you.” Today I know much better, and once again I repeat without the slightest hesitation, Narin was the princess of her family, the apple of the eye of her parents and of her two big brothers. Narin was a very loved and happy child. Each of them would rather have suffered the greatest harm themselves than let any harm come to her. The sensationalist media saw everything, absolutely everything extra, but for nearly a year they stubbornly refused to see this simple truth. They still refuse. Along with them, politicians, rights defenders, journalists, human rights organizations, bar associations, and sadly even women’s organizations did not see it either. Now, in any case, everyone has turned their heads entirely elsewhere.\nYet everyone who has uttered even a single sentence about this matter — everyone who, by adopting as fact the claim that Narin’s family were complicit in this horrific murder, produced news, broadcasts, or commentary — each and every one of them has a responsibility to address the new picture that is emerging. We cannot simply wait for the Court of Cassation process without doing anything. In which publicly known case up to today have we been able to quietly leave things to whatever ruling would be handed down in court proceedings? In which case of a murdered woman or child, or in which political case, have we ever been able to trust the court process?\nMoreover, the clear and detailed dissent attached to the decision by the presiding judge in the appellate process already shows that the truth has not come out and that we have a responsibility to make an effort to understand the truth. Because at the beginning of the incident everyone spoke. This family went through all of this because of that. We cannot fall silent now. Unfortunately the situation is so grave that one feels embarrassed even while commenting; some individuals on social media who intervened in the case by accusing the Güran family went almost mad in the face of the possibility that the family might be innocent. And there was a troll army that was impossible to cope with. A shabby crowd on social media that increased follower counts by talking about Narin’s family…\n\n\nThose Who Shut Their Eyes to the Truth\nI am sorry to write this, but especially that crowd — if by some miracle little Narin were to emerge alive from somewhere — would want the family to kill her immediately so that they could be proven right… After the new evidence submitted to the appellate court, the report from India, and the enhanced images, can those who keep their eyes tightly shut to the possibility of the family’s innocence claim otherwise?\nSadly, Narin is not the first child to be mercilessly torn from this life. Years ago, in this piece at the following link[3], I covered in detail the first missing child case in modern Turkey that occupied the public for months and years. The little Ayla mentioned in that piece was never found. But there are countless — truly countless — children who, after going missing, were later found brutally murdered. Children disappear all over the world. And then there are those who are mercilessly killed in broad daylight before everyone’s eyes. Like beautiful Ahmet Minguzzi, stabbed to death in a crowded marketplace and under cameras. And the ones who killed him were children, too…\nSo why do I insist on treating the Narin case as something unprecedented? Because in none of these other cases were the families, while suffering a terrible grief, simultaneously branded as the child’s killers, tortured on the very day their child’s lifeless body was found, and thrown into prison. What followed Narin’s disappearance may well never have happened before in world history. The injustice is that great.\n\n\n\nExternal References (3)\n\n\nT24: Detained Confessor Nevzat Bahtiyar: It Was Being Talked About in the Neighborhood That Narin’s Mother and Her Uncle Salim Güran Had a Relationship (12 September 2024) ↩︎\n\n\nCUMHURİYET: The Last Birthday Video of Narin Güran Has Emerged: She Blew Out the Candles and Hugged Her First!

    "section": "On the Simplicity of Truth",
    "text": "On the Simplicity of Truth\nIn the foreword he wrote for the published screenplay of Beynelmilel, Sırrı Süreyya Önder quoted Dziga Vertov, one of the prominent names of Soviet revolutionary cinema: “It is not simple to show the truth, because the truth is simple.” He continued from this quotation by saying that in Beynelmilel, too, life and truth stood before him in that simplicity. When I spoke with him about the Narin case I find myself thinking, “if only,” I say, “Ah, if only I had known then about this foreword he wrote.” But I did not.\nShortly after I wrote the piece about the possibility that Narin’s family might be innocent, I thought that I should talk to Sırrı Süreyya about this and ask for his support. At the first opportunity I found, I brought up the issue with him in the corridors of Parliament. He used to like and read my writings. He generally did not miss much of what was published in the places where people like us share a common reading space. But he had not read my piece on Narin. So I first sent him the article and then the interview I did with Gökçer Tahincioğlu. In our next conversation I said, “President Sırrı, this matter is a difficult matter, but I will get involved in it, we have to get involved.”\nHe had now read the article and the interview, and he said, exactly and without any hesitation, “Handle it as you see fit, Hocam, I’m behind you all the way.” He truly said it like that. I told a journalist friend who visited us at home that same evening about this conversation. I remember saying to that friend, “This is what life knowledge, the knowledge of story and truth, looks like.” Who other than Sırrı Süreyya would understand, at a single reading, the truth standing before us in all its simplicity? Had he lived, we would also have had the opportunity to address this issue with him, to exchange views on how we might rescue this abandoned family from this nightmare. Despite all his burdens, he would have done what he could. I know this. Sadly, this was not possible.\nBut I think he continued to support me even after his death. In many of the articles and interviews I found and read after his passing, he continued to tell me with his sentences, “Handle it as you see fit, I’m behind you all the way.” For example, in one interview, when Sadi Çilingir asked him, “Then can we say that your storytelling has turned into a mission?” he replied: “It turned into one inevitably. Because there are those who say, ‘You voiced this. You will voice that, too.’ None of these are requests you can turn your back on.” Here, in a style Dear Sırrı Süreyya would have liked, I would like to continue and reinforce this emphasis with an example from a film.\n\nThe Responsibility of the Storyteller and the Film Léon\nThere is an unforgettable line in Léon, one of the major box office films of its time and also a good example of popular cinema. The little girl Mathilda knocks on Léon’s door; Léon, who once opened that door and saved her life, is behind the door but this time does not want to open it. Mathilda says, “You opened this door for me once; if you don’t open it now, it will be as if you never opened it.”\nWhat is described here is the same as the mission and responsibility of the storyteller that Sırrı Süreyya spoke about. If you have once listened and chosen to tell, then you must continue to tell. Because in an age when even the most vital stories are lost as if written on water, you cannot voice a narrative dedicated to the search for justice once and then abandon it. To keep that narrative alive, to sustain it at proper intervals, becomes a condition of the pursuit of justice. When you let that narrative fall silent from your tongue, sadly there are very few waiting to lift its truth up from the ground. Sırrı Süreyya Önder was one of those who listened to the story and pain of the other and who gave it a voice. He bore a voice whose strength came from stories.\n\n\nThe Simplicity of Truth and the Narin Case\nIt was for this reason that he could grasp, at a glance, that in Narin’s killing the difficulty of showing the truth lay precisely in its simplicity. He was one of those people who, when voicing a story, kept in mind that every story touches many lives, that every life is valuable, and that we are mortal. Indeed, did not Walter Benjamin say, “Death is the sanction of everything the storyteller can tell. The storyteller borrows his authority from death”?\nI believe that Sırrı Süreyya also very quickly understood who Nevzat was — Nevzat, who stood right there on Narin’s path, who changed his statements radically seven times, and whose statement that currently forms the basis of the court’s decision has now been revealed, plainly, to be utterly false. Moreover, in this case Sırrı Süreyya did not know about the final opinions or reports submitted on appeal. In fact, he did not need to. The person who killed the child had, with what he did up through the nineteenth day, at every stage shouted out loud that he was the killer. As I said, Sırrı Süreyya had the life wisdom to understand this, and he understood it.\nOf course we cannot compare Sırrı Süreyya’s wisdom to those who, with spite and fury, attack those who voice the truth. We can only go on telling. We must go on telling what happened to Narin, that those who understand the simplicity of the truth are growing in number, that a protest is swelling like an avalanche. Narin could not make it up that path. As I wrote before: “Nevzat is right in the middle of this. In the middle. At a point where Narin, walking toward home, could have encountered him. In my view Narin was not able to take even one step past him. She could not, that poor little girl…”\n\n\nConfusion of Mind and Ruthlessness\nThe last thing I must mention in speaking of Sırrı Süreyya Önder is that he led me to watch the Netflix series Adolescence. After putting it off, I watched it quickly following a conversation with him. Later, that four-part series often came to my mind as I was thinking about the Narin case. During a general assembly session he came up to me, and after asking how I was, he said, “My daughter also wrote a piece of film criticism,” and, with a proud smile at the corner of his lip, he sent me Ceren’s piece via WhatsApp right there.\nThat day, whether by a slip of the tongue or for some other reason, he called this four-part mini-series “cinema,” and later on I myself almost completely forgot that Adolescence was not a film but a mini-series. I experienced a mental mix-up, and when my friends asked, “Wasn’t it a series?” at the point where I called Adolescence a film, I said, “No, it was a film,” with certainty. Yet we know from what happened to Narin’s family just how dangerous the matter of a person’s mind becoming confused can be…\nBecause that is how it is; even ordinary fatigue or a small tension on a normal day can create confusion. You forget many things, or remember them differently. To expect that people who have experienced severe trauma will not have confused memories when, days later, they are required to recall the details of daily life is a grave mercilessness… Every statement by the Gürans that was labeled a contradiction was, in reality, a simple confusion of mind that cannot in any way be compared to Nevzat’s grand lies… Sadly, mercy never set foot in their neighborhood. Confusions of mind that could occur on the most ordinary day were mercilessly twisted.\n\n\nThe Series Adolescence and the Narin Case\nAnyway, let us return to the series Adolescence. In order to read Ceren’s piece, that very night I immediately watched the four-part series back to back. Then I considered what happened to Narin and her family again, after this much-talked-about series. Let me explain that as well. In the piece I wrote for bianet in relation to the Narin case, I said that this family had no reason to kill their only daughter, and that no such reason had been found. The demagogues of social media jumped on the article, saying, “Do you need a ‘reason’ to kill a child, what sort of reason do you look for in the killing of a child,” and many self-styled wise minds angrily carried that argument forward.\nYet of course, seeking a plausible explanation as to why the family would commit such evil does not mean making the murder plausible. It means trying to understand with what motive, under what drive, this murder was committed. Indeed, in Adolescence, even though the murder is watched openly under the cameras and the killer is immediately arrested, throughout four episodes people exert frenzied effort to understand the motive of the child who committed this murder — in other words, the reason for the murder. Until all the pieces fall into place.\n\n\nThe Inconsistency of the Reasoned Judgment\nIn all the time that has passed since Narin’s killing, neither has any such motive been described, nor has a single person from the family or the village said anything despite all the torment. They did not speak, they could not speak. Because they knew nothing and had seen nothing. In short, although Narin’s brother, uncle, and mother are now in prison under severe isolation, nowhere — including in the court’s reasoned judgment — has even the faintest explanation been offered as to why they supposedly committed this murder. It is as if, for no reason at all, they said, “Let Narin come back from her course, and we will all kill her together.”\nIn this sense the reasoned judgment shamefully attempted to compensate for this lack of motive by speaking of an “as-yet-unrevealed principal purpose,” and left it there. Moreover, since they could not bring themselves to label Nevzat a liar, they reached, with a twist that had never once arisen during the hearings, the conclusion that Salim Güran had lied to Nevzat — “She witnessed my relationship with her mother, that’s why I killed her” — in order to conceal the principal purpose. As for what that principal purpose was, even now, nearly a year later, not a single explanation has been provided. It is not a joke; this is truly the situation…\n\n\n\nSırrı Süreyya Önder\n\n\n\n\nFinal Word: Wisdom and the Wish for Peace\nIn short, the difficulty of showing the simplicity of truth had become, through the exceptional personality of Sırrı Süreyya Önder, a point of focus. Today I wanted to write about this wisdom of his. Because rethinking the death of little Narin in the light of this wisdom is very illuminating. I would like once more to say, may Sırrı Süreyya rest in light. May the peace he dreamed of come true soon…"

    "text": "AUTHOR\n\n\nSevilay Çelenk\n\n\nLAST UPDATED\n\n\nJanuary 31, 2025\n\n\nSOURCE\n\n\nOriginal Source\n\n\nReading Time\n\n\n~ 1 h 4 min\n\n\nWord Count\n\n\n11809\nIn a previous article about Narin, I had written, “We searched for Narin as if searching for one last way out.” Apparently, even then, in our search for Narin, I sensed that excess, that something extra which did not quite correspond to simply looking for a missing little girl, or rather, expressed much more than looking for a missing child. Yet the interpretation of that intuition had remained incomplete. I now understand that searching for a way out was in fact not searching for Narin. For a tiny missing girl could not have led us to an exit. Indeed, in that futile search, each of us became tangled in our own impasse. I fear that in the way the trial concluded—surely not in a manner that will allow Narin to rest in peace where she lies—we all share some responsibility.\nToday, at last, I returned to the article I wrote days ago—immediately after the second hearing—about Narin’s killing and the sentencing hearing. The reasoned judgment was announced only a very short time ago. I did not want to put the final full stop to the article before seeing this decision.\nWriting this article was difficult. I began it exhausted from an extremely conflicted state of mind: on one hand being unable to stop thinking about this matter, on the other hand fearing that the thoughts swirling in my mind would fade. Moreover, as time passed, I was anxious that I might no longer be able to speak of my thoughts in a coherent way. Because I believe I owe this article to Narin. In fact, an entire country still owes Narin a debt. We owe her the truth, and the truth has not emerged.\nBeyond that, there is another possibility so painful that one can hardly even bring oneself to articulate it. Independent of whether one truly believes in the hereafter and the torment of the soul, I wish to say this: there is a possibility that, in this case, the judicial process ended with a terrible error that will leave Narin’s soul eternally tormented. For her mother, who perhaps loved, protected, and watched over Narin more than her own life in this world, may have been subjected to horrific slanders and insults, summoned to clear her honor before even being able to mourn her child, and ultimately sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment without ever learning exactly what happened to her precious daughter or even seeing her grave. Unfortunately, I consider this to be a rather high probability.\nThe publication of the reasoned judgment has not eliminated this possibility. Beyond that, the incredible logical contradictions in the strongest piece of evidence leading to the aggravated life sentences of three family members—namely the retrospectively narrowed base station analysis and the HTS signal records—have further reinforced this conviction of mine. To shed light on the murder, the only things we have are the HTS records belonging to individuals moving in the same area and time shredded into seconds and fractions of seconds. Even by focusing solely on this slice of time, it becomes apparent that the testimony of the time of the camera or HTS signal records says nothing about why Narin was killed. It casts a very heavy shadow over the allegations against the family linked to the murder. I can even say it renders many of these allegations impossible. I will later address these contradictions in the evaluation of the evidence in the reasoned judgment.\nThe thought that the mother is a victim in this case has been circling in my mind from the very beginning. It has gnawed at me. Furthermore, I now think that, like Mother Yüksel Güran, her son Enes, and even Uncle Salim Güran—who appears quite unpleasant to most people, as he does to me—may also be innocent. Even if they may be bad people toward those over whom they have power, I do not think they are worse than many others. In my view, the Güran family is not a very powerful family. I also think Tavşantepe is only as mysterious as any other village and, at the same time, as exposed and visible as any other village. Neither the Güran family nor the villagers of Tavşantepe are, in my opinion, the horrifying partners in some unimaginably immense, inconceivable secret. Much is not as it seems, and much is exactly as it seems… That is how it appears to me. I hope I can explain my point in this article.\nLike everyone else, I too initially held very strong convictions about the Narin murder, and all of them were against the family. It was indeed not easy for me to detach from those convictions and arrive at this point. These thoughts began to gradually haunt my mind from around noon on the second day of the hearing—after I had listened to countless allegations and defenses. By the evening of the second day, my thoughts had almost crystallized. The days that followed, the defenses I read, and the examinations I conducted on how the issue was covered in the media have not, from that day to today, produced anything that would undermine this clarity. I had previously made my earlier thoughts public through writing or interviews. For this reason, I now feel obliged to write and share what I think today as well. As I said, we owe Narin the truth. Moreover, there is a village and two families whose lives have been ruined and who are under suspicion from seven to seventy.\nI followed this painful incident closely as a member of parliament for Diyarbakır, as someone who has reflected on missing children and the dark sides of the notion of family and on media interest in such events, and as an academic who has written on these issues. In the days when Narin disappeared, I also went to Tavşantepe village with three friends from our Diyarbakır provincial organization. In the village, I met with Narin’s mother, father, one of her uncles, and one of her siblings, and I was in their home environment. Later I wrote two articles on this matter. One of them was published in Birikim[1]. I also have another, as yet unpublished, article that I wrote for a forthcoming book on Diyarbakır in another context, in which I devote extensive space to the Narin case. Particularly in this second text, the sense of horror triggered by the story of an eight-year-old child murdered in her home in the presence of her family is very pronounced. I also gave several interviews about the incident. Some of the ideas I advanced in these writings and interviews have radically changed today.\nSo who or what tells me that what I am about to share is the truth? You may ask this question, and I have kept asking it of myself as well."

    "title": "We Owe Narin the Truth",
    "section": "Courage of Truth",
    "text": "Courage of Truth\nPerhaps I can answer this question with inspiration or support from Michel Foucault’s work Speaking the Truth[2]. Foucault answers the question “How can the person who claims to be a parrhesiastes (one who shows courage of truth) be sure that what they believe is in fact the truth?” as follows: “I think the parrhesiastes says what is true because he knows that it is true, and he knows that it is true because it is really true.” According to Foucault, the person who advances a truth here believes what they are saying. Therefore, the one who speaks the truth, who has shown the courage of truth, speaks the “truth” because they believe what they say is so (p. 13).\nThe explanation, of course, appears complicated. Because does not everyone who speaks about a certain fact (in this case, about the Narin incident) already say what they believe to be true? In every situation where we think what we say is correct, do we thereby speak the truth and show the courage of truth? Foucault’s answer is that a person can be said to have shown the courage to speak the truth only when speaking the truth entails risk or danger and when they do so in opposition to some power. That is all I will say about this in this context. I wrote this article because I believe my thoughts regarding the Narin incident are the truth. In this sense, I think I am taking a significant risk. I know from the uneasiness I feel inside that I am setting myself against the power created in the public sphere as much as against political power, namely the power established by the common discourse. Indeed, Foucault also says that this risk need not be extremely great or a matter of life and death; it may simply be the risk of saying something that the audience will not like (p. 13).\nIn the Narin trial, although the persons (three family members) whom the vast majority of society considers guilty were sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment, a satisfactory response to the demand for truth was not produced. The fact that the defendant Nevzat Bahtiyar received a sentence much lighter than expected and one that would allow his release after about a year does not explain this dissatisfaction either. For when, on the first day of the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor requested aggravated life imprisonment for all four detained defendants, the impact of this opinion was almost as if the Narin case had ended in impunity. Because what was wanted was not that each of those who appeared guilty be punished with the most severe penalties, but that the truth should be revealed. The answer to the questions of who killed Narin, why, and how did not emerge from this judgment of aggravated life imprisonment. The characterization of the defendants as “joint perpetrators” was not sufficient. Truth was wanted. I now see that, after the reasoned judgment, this demand is being raised even more strongly.\n\n\n\nThe Chair of the Parliamentary Human Rights Investigation Commission and AKP Osmaniye MP Derya Yanık, together with commission member MPs, is seen at the second hearing of the Narin case.\n\n\nYet, unfortunately, the extremely intense public and media interest had almost completely destroyed the chance for the truth about Narin to come to light. The incident had been made so complex by the prejudices and assumptions of those standing at the opposing poles of social polarization, and the truth so thoroughly covered over, that its chance of emerging had become nearly nonexistent.\nWe found ourselves in a situation reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe’s short story The Purloined Letter, which has been the subject of psychoanalytic analyses and discussions by thinkers such as Lacan and Derrida. To summarize the story briefly: an important letter that has been stolen and is being searched for in every corner is in fact out in the open—it has, as it were, been hidden by not being hidden. While every nook and the most unlikely places are searched in order to find it, the letter remains in plain sight. Those who are curious can read a good commentary on the story at the link[3]. In the monstrously exaggerated murder of Narin to which we ascribed excessive mystery, the envelope (the truth) lying in the open, just like Poe’s missing letter, has become unfindable and invisible. It has even become impossible to consider that it might be right there, in full view of everyone. I do not think anyone can deny this.\nThe hearings in the Narin case were held in Diyarbakır and lasted exactly three days, from 26 to 28 December. Every morning I was there at the start time of the hearing and spent most of my time in the courtroom at the Diyarbakır Courthouse among defendants, lawyers, relatives of defendants, and politicians. In fact, I had not planned to stay that long. But the course of the trial, what was said, and many other things bound me there. On the first day of the sentencing hearing, dozens of MPs from different parties also came to Diyarbakır. In previous stages, the Ministers of Justice, Interior, and Family and Social Services had also come to Diyarbakır and visited Narin’s grave. Following the Narin Güran[4] murder, a Parliamentary Research Commission, briefly referred to as the “Narin Commission” under the roof of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, had been established under the title “Commission of Inquiry for Determining the Measures to be Taken to Protect Children from All Forms of Violence, Neglect and Abuse and to Promote Their Mental, Spiritual and Physical Health.” Many members of this commission were in Diyarbakır on the day of the hearing as well. Essentially, I was there as a Member of Parliament for Diyarbakır and observed the trial representing the DEM Party, but I was, like many others, personally very concerned with the incident. Therefore, I wish to state clearly that the views I set forth here and the responsibility for these views belong solely and entirely to me, as a social scientist and a citizen. As an academic who has been writing for years, I have not informed the party about my previous writings on Narin or about this article, just as with my other writings during my term as a Member of Parliament. This time, I did want to share my thoughts with some authorized figures, but that would have meant sharing the responsibility as well. As I said, to err is human; if I am mistaken and the veil over the truth is lifted and this article is refuted, that error will belong wholly to me.\nUntil the evening of the first day of the sentencing hearing, I too, like many others, thought first and foremost that the Narin murder had occurred at home, though I was excessively fixated on a particular point. There were many reasons for this. First of all, after the Diyarbakır city center, which spreads over a flat, slopeless area like a tray, when you turn towards Çarıklı and then climb in winding fashion up to Tavşantepe village, seeing those narrow streets and houses lined up side by side, you think that it is impossible for a stranger to enter and leave without being seen. Beyond that, even if one had never taken seriously the remarks that began to spread in the very first minutes of the incident such as “Kurds… Things like that happen over there,” it must be admitted that one becomes mentally susceptible to other rumors. Hüda-Par, Hizbullah, AKP, rumors about the Güran family’s dark dealings, Qur’an course rumors… For our memory sadly does not provide very favorable associations with any of these. So when I visited Tavşantepe for the first time, by the end of the day, the first murder theory that made sense to me was that Narin had “seen something she was not supposed to see.” When it became clear that her last image had been recorded by school cameras, I became convinced that whatever she had witnessed took place at home. Because while returning from the Qur’an course with her friends, Narin at one point leaves them and turns onto the path leading to her house.\nMany things nurtured these convictions, of course. For instance, during our visit to the village, a woman suddenly jumped in front of us very close to Narin’s house and said, “The child came home, she came, she threw her bag on the stairs!” Yet up to that date, no one had advanced any such evidence, true or false, that the child had returned home. Indeed, it later became clear that at the time of her death, it was far more likely that Narin’s bag was already around her neck. Nevzat said the bag was closed and hanging around the child’s neck, and the bag was indeed found in the sack where Narin’s lifeless body was discovered. I would have preferred not to dwell as much as possible on such forensic details, but this incident is important as it shows how the village rumor mill was operating at every moment. As is understood from this, contrary to the allegations, the villagers were not wrapped in some great secrecy either. They did not appear to be collectively suppressing and covering up the incident with the family; in fact, the situation is not like that. It is more likely that the people of Tavşantepe, despite knowing nothing, talked among themselves as if they knew something. Most probably, like each of us, the villagers of Tavşantepe, even if they did not speak to the cameras, both amplified the flood of words circulating and later put these words back into circulation as proof of the family members’ guilt. Just like the entire country…"

    "text": "How did events come to this point? How did they turn so much against the Güran family?\nThe broken Turkish, and even broken Kurdish, spoken by a mother who, under the gaze of the media and curious eyes, was cornered like a rabbit caught in headlights, swiftly turned against her, leading from the very first days to horrible accusations against her. A few accusatory social media posts in the early days accelerated this process. The fact that Yüksel Güran had said to the gendarmerie, before Narin’s lifeless body was found, “How can we protect my son Enes?” was considered proof that she knew her daughter was dead and that the killer was Enes. Accordingly, the monster mother’s priority was to protect her son. It was said that the little girl, Narin, did not matter to the mother at all. Yet from the very first minutes, Enes’s name was being linked to so many rumors, allegations, and accusations that what could be more natural than that Mother Yüksel expressed both her anguish over her daughter’s disappearance and her concern over the rumors about her son? Every word she uttered in her inadequate Turkish was seen as a kind of confession/evidence, and every gesture, movement, and glance was subjected to a test of sincerity under the cameras. Some commented on the way her eyebrows were set, others on the absence of tears in her eyes. Yet Yüksel Güran was a mother who, with the disappearance of her only daughter, was forced to experience her anxiety and sorrow under excessive attention and dozens of cameras. She had suddenly become someone known to all of Turkey, and this was not her choice. Imagine being forced, at a moment when you are deeply distressed and devastated, to prove your sorrow and grief under the scrutiny of cameras, either directly or through insinuations. Is that not terrifying?\nWhat is in fact most clearly understood from the defenses and statements that I did not content myself with only listening to at the hearing but also later specially requested and read is this: nearly all of the mother’s, Enes’s, the father’s, and even the uncle’s attitudes and statements that suddenly turned against them are related to their including in their statements many of the rumors that had entered circulation, their being thrown into confusion, and their making some changes in their statements based on what they had learned while the circle around them was being tightened by unimaginable hatred. None of these changes in statement is as serious or grave, for instance, as the changes in the statements of Nevzat Bahtiyar.\nAs Father Arif Güran said, banging on the table and sobbing in the courtroom, their daily routines, second by second, minute by minute, were broken down into units and scrutinized, while their lives and souls were destroyed. In a terrifying state of anxiety and grief, they were at the same time bewildered under unimaginable accusations. They simply could not fully remember certain things; other things they revised in light of new information they had heard. Let us give two examples: in response to the allegation that the father and the uncle had given contradictory and incorrect information about the time when Narin disappeared, both regarding themselves and Enes, they said roughly this (I paraphrase): first we said after 15:00, because she left school with her friends around that time, but then one person from the village said he had seen Narin after 17:30, and another said he had seen her at a later time. As a family, we run after every piece of news we hear, we investigate; there is no one else running around except us. Later we say she was last seen at this hour. In short, while trying to follow up what they heard in the village as they searched for the child, they revise the time of Narin’s disappearance, first saying it was after this time, then, “No, it was after that time.” These revised statements immediately come back at them as serious accusations.\n\n\n\nCHP Women’s Branch Chair Asu Kaya is making a statement in front of the courthouse at the first hearing of the Narin case (07.11.2024).\n\n\nLikewise, the allegation that Uncle Salim Güran manipulated those who said they had seen Narin in the village at different times in the evening cannot be substantiated. Although the media, the opposing side, or institutional lawyers state in their declarations that Salim Güran manipulated these people, the individuals who later claimed to have seen Narin say—again, paraphrasing—that while they were talking among themselves about having been mistaken about the time they saw her, he heard them and said “tell it like this,” using vague expressions in trying to implicate Salim Güran in the incorrect statement of time. Essentially, even the most serious allegations about changes in the family members’ statements concern matters that cannot concretely obscure an incident, revolving around “first he said this, then he said that.” Moreover, as one focuses more closely on these details, it becomes clear that every new piece of information claimed to have been obtained from them contradicts previous accusations against the family members and weakens these accusations. Yet, unfortunately, no one takes this into account.\nThere is a great deal of information about the family that is mutually contradictory and that, though used as proof of their guilt, actually undermines itself and repeats relentlessly. For instance, if Narin had “seen something she should not have seen” and was murdered in the home by family members for that reason, how is the PSA (sign of sexual abuse) found in her underwear and clothes explained in that case? Did Enes or Uncle Salim, in this scenario, both kill and at the same time abuse Narin in the brief time window (8 minutes) and in panic after she reached home because she had witnessed something? Or did Nevzat, after having taken Narin’s lifeless body from Salim under threat and in fear in order to bury it, abuse her at the riverside before burying her? In that case, are we to believe that a man who had been intimidated, co-opted into the killing of a child under duress, who had been cowed by the Güran family for years, somehow regained sufficient composure to commit this abuse and then went to his sister-in-law’s home in the village to have tea as if nothing had happened, and returned home with cheese as he had planned with his wife that morning? And if he had been made to participate in the incident in such a way, how are we to explain his joining the search for Narin with the family for days, lamenting and sighing? Did they say to him, “Never leave our side”? If so, why did they say so? When, in fact, the more likely instruction would be “Do not hang around too visibly for a while”…"

    "section": "The Ordinary Course of Life",
    "text": "The Ordinary Course of Life\nBecause the phrase “the ordinary course of life” appears so often in the accusations and allegations against the family, I shall also have to refer to this “ordinary course” from time to time. In that case, could the scenario that better conforms to the ordinary course of life be the following? Can we not, even if only hypothetically, for a moment look at this from that perspective as well? Nevzat encounters Narin, who turns onto the footpath to go home after leaving her friends at 15:11. This is a very strong probability. Because according to the base station reports, within one or two minutes, Nevzat is on the footpath between Salim’s and Arif’s houses. As far as I understand, it is not only the disputed base station report but also Nevzat’s own statement that supports this. Because he says he called Salim at those minutes. He says that, because his water was cut off, he wanted to call and tell the mukhtar, Salim. This 42-second phone call is also present in the HTS call records. He says he then went out, opened the water in his mother’s garden, and used the hose attached there to water his own garden. In order to open the water in his mother’s garden, he had to go to or see the very area where Narin would have been passing at that moment. The family’s lawyers explain this in a way that leaves no room for doubt.\nThe family’s lawyers, by asking many questions that remain unanswered, in fact presented us with another perspective as well. Some of these correspond roughly to the following questions (again, I paraphrase), which in turn suggest further questions: could it be that, as he had always seen Narin use the same route, when he saw her again that day, Nevzat, whether or not he had premeditated it, in a moment of impulsive behavior or through feelings of envy and hostility toward the family, suddenly dragged the child into his own barn/backyard or persuaded her to go with him by saying he would show her something? Furthermore, upon the child’s resistance or screams, could this assault have very quickly resulted in murder? Do the things he says he did after burying Narin’s lifeless body in the riverbed (going to the village, having tea, buying cheese) not bring him closer to this type of character than to that of a frightened and co-opted man forced to participate in a crime? Does his staying constantly by the grieving family’s side in the days that followed not correspond more to this scenario? Because he did not disappear and remained supportive to the family, is it not understandable that the family never suspected him, while, for 19 days, he would have had ample time to calmly eliminate all evidence in his barn or house? These are all just questions—questions that must be thought about and posed, and indeed were posed in court.\nAs for the course of events and the ordinary flow of life, the one thing that most clearly does not fit that flow is the time between the moment the child was last seen and the moment Nevzat’s vehicle is seen on the Eğertutmaz stream road. This time frame does not allow for an unpremeditated family murder. And the claim that the murder might have been premeditated never attains any reasonable explanation. If Narin had previously seen something, she would not have been allowed to go happily to the Qur’an course that day. Because if whatever she had seen or known is serious enough to lead to such a horrendous murder, the possibility that she might tell someone could never be dismissed out of hand.\nYes, we almost cannot be convinced in any way by a family murder compressed into a maximum of half an hour. Because this half hour is not spent entirely at home. The child must first climb the footpath for at least 3–4 minutes to reach her home after leaving her friends. For Nevzat, in whatever manner, to go to the house upon being called by Salim, to take Narin’s lifeless body, and then to appear with his car on the Eğertutmaz stream road 2 kilometers away requires that he have spent at least another 7–8 minutes. Especially if we accept his claim that he first took Narin’s lifeless body from Salim wrapped in a blanket at the father’s house, then went to his own home, threw her through the window into the barn, then entered the barn and placed the body into the sack in which it was later found, it is almost impossible for this to have taken less than 7–8 minutes. As we can see if we examine the reasoned judgment, there are only and only 8 minutes between the moment Narin arrives home and the moment her body is seen by Nevzat in a room in Arif’s house. I will address this in later pages. According to the ordinary course of life, a family murder committed through joint perpetration does not appear to fit within this period.\n\n\n\nJustice for Narin Güran."

    "section": "8 minutes",
    "text": "8 minutes\nEight minutes for Narin to be killed collectively in her own home or barn in panic and confusion following her witnessing something, and for her body to be handed over to Nevzat by Salim in a room. In this scenario, everything else can somehow be explained in accordance with the ordinary course of life, but this cannot. The mother, Salim, and Enes have no reasonable reason whatsoever to kill Narin immediately upon arriving home; no such reason has been found. A premeditated murder is not in question. If the incident happened because Enes did something and was caught by Narin, it is impossible that the mother could have witnessed this horrific event—whether it took place before her eyes or in their own barn (as is alleged)—and not been affected at all and immediately embarked on a cover-up effort. When you say this, it is said, “It is possible, because the family is professional!” One must ask, “Professional in what?” Professional in killing their own child and, within 8 minutes, letting a stranger disappear the body like a kitten and accepting that she would not even have a grave? I do not think such professionalism exists… Yes, people can murder their own children in horrific ways, and they do. But we cannot treat this fact as a guarantee that any family can easily do this.\nI believe it was in the days when Narin was missing that journalist Ayşe Hür wrote in a social media message, roughly, “It is clear that Narin was loved, spoiled, dressed up, a happy child.” She was saying this after looking at many photos. And indeed she appears so. A child whose hair has been nicely combed and braided, dressed in nice clothes, smiling happily… Indeed, it was very possible to feel this in every line of Father Arif Güran’s long speech. Mother Yüksel Güran said, “We were a happy family.” It was also very painful. They were being forced to prove that they had dearly loved their murdered child. Together, we were forcing them to do this…\nIt was, I think, the first day of the hearing. After we had taken our seats in the courtroom, the mother was brought in. As she passed right in front of us, she paused for a moment and said to me, “Pray for a mother.” Those words, her look at that moment, her body shrunk and diminished since the first time I saw her in the village, and that pale face of hers, have never left my mind. I am, above all, a feminist academic. I cannot accept that a woman should be sacrificed together with her child in this way. Had Mother Yüksel been sacrificed for remaining silent in order to protect her surviving child Enes, I could not have accepted that either. Because the price of silence is not aggravated life imprisonment. But the ordinary course of the family’s life at the times when Narin was allegedly killed does not suggest that the mother sacrificed herself to protect Enes. It does not suggest that the mother knew anything. As is apparent, she is not able to protect Enes in any way; moreover, she leaves her two small children, one of them six years old, without a parent by ending up in prison, which is beyond comprehension… From this point on, even if one of these three prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment were to confess to the murder, it would be very hard to believe… Unfortunately, we have, collectively, almost condemned the truth surrounding the Narin incident to remain forever unrevealed in a credible way. That is why I write at such length. It is as if this writing is a kind of atonement for what I have written and said before…\nTo reiterate, it is not possible that Mother Yüksel witnessed Narin being killed, failed to prevent it or was late, and yet, without losing a second, immediately embarked on an effort to cover up the incident. When a person themself or someone next to them breaks a jar, they cannot instantly gather themselves and begin cleaning. Yes, there are only and only 8 minutes for the killing of Narin, the mother witnessing this, calling the uncle, the uncle coming to the house, and, through a rapid shared plan, calling Nevzat to be able to happen. These things do not happen in 8 minutes. Let us assume that Salim was already at his brother Arif Güran’s house at those minutes. Even then, it does not seem possible. If we speak of a concrete piece of evidence in this incident, it is this. That is, if we are indeed speaking of the ordinary course of life.\nThere are so many things that are impossible. One of the most serious allegations about the incident arises within the framework of “incest/homosexual relations between uncle and nephew or male cousins,” I suppose. Yet it is not possible that Enes could have been caught by Narin in the barn with his uncle or cousin—or cousins—in a situation that they would not want anyone to see. For it is not rational to take this risk in a barn right beside the house while others are in the home. There is no prior story or evidence of such behavior in relation to the uncle. Nor is there any with respect to Enes. Nor regarding the cousin or cousins. Moreover, even if someone had been caught in such a situation, it is still impossible that they would instantly organize themselves so effectively and fit a plan to kill the child and eliminate the body—including by involving Nevzat (!!)—into 8 minutes. Impossible…\nFinally, let us consider another possibility: that Enes himself attempted to abuse his sister and, upon her resistance, panicked and killed her. The scratches or abrasions on Enes’s body were explained in this way. Let us ask again: given that she could not protect even her son (Enes), why would a mother participate in such a horrendous crime by leaving her two small children motherless and accepting such heavy slander in order to protect him? She probably knows that she cannot truly protect a child of such character in this way either. Let us say we understand the mother, but why would the uncle, if Enes did this, shoulder this crime? I am very sorry, but when one considers the whole matter carefully, neither incest, nor arms trafficking, nor homosexual relations, nor abuse would, in our time, be a secret that would destroy two families at once. There is no reason for it to be. Narin was a razor-sharp child; it would have been enough to pull her aside and say, “Look, if someone hears about this, if your father hears about it, this and that will happen to us.” Frightening or persuading her would have been enough. Let us say they could not, let us say they killed her; with so many accusations piled upon them, they would have done something to save either the mother, or Enes, or the uncle. At first, we were all certain that the family was being protected. Now that three members of the family have been sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment, should we not at least question our conviction that this is a powerful and protected family?\nIn short, this family does not appear to have been protected. They were not protected. The family could not protect themselves either. We have seen in the judgment that, in the eyes of the AKP, the family is ultimately nothing more than a Kurdish family living in the rural area of Tavşantepe. The fact that three of its members—despite many allegations having been refuted and many media lies exposed—are left alone with these sentences shows this. It is apparent that no evidence was interpreted in their favor and that, under the pressure of public opinion and the media, eyes were closed to the truth. Furthermore, as I pointed out in my first article, the fact that the gendarmerie, which is inexperienced in this type of incident, virtually stormed the scene with heavy equipment, thereby either ruining the evidence or leaving it to disappear over the ensuing days, is a reality acknowledged by the lawyers of both sides. The incident was investigated for days under the initiative of the gendarmerie. Even after Nevzat was forced to confess his crime, neither his relatives were immediately taken into custody, nor were his house or barn promptly and effectively searched. These are what the family’s lawyers say. The other side’s lawyer, as well as the Ministry of Family or the Diyarbakır Bar Association, which are parties to the case, offer no alternative explanation on this point. They do not say, “They were searched.” Moreover, in Nevzat’s interrogation, when the family’s lawyer makes a statement regarding Nevzat’s wife, the presiding judge immediately moves to block it, saying, “She is not a suspect, she is not a suspect,” and quickly closes the subject. You can see this clearly in the defense text. Yet in fact, given that everyone who had contact with the family, like the rest of the family itself, was in some sense a “suspect,” should it not have been permissible to refer to situations in which the wife could also be considered “suspect”? I do not know; this is a question that falls within the domain of law."

    "section": "Sinkholes that Swallow the Truth",
    "text": "Sinkholes that Swallow the Truth\nMany accusations and allegations against the Güran family have clearly proven baseless. The claims that the carpets were washed, that all family members deleted their WhatsApp records (only Uncle Salim deletes his phone records because of sexual content on his phone; that is what he says). There is an allegation that some family members deleted messages. But there is no such systematic thing as “the whole family, the whole village, deleted records.” Moreover, let us think: if each of us faced the possibility of being taken into custody at any moment, who could say that they would not review their phone? Because in such a situation, your phone is taken from you and does not return for months, and in many cases never returns. Since the accusations against the family kicked in from the moment the child disappeared, there must also have been those who, for many reasons, deleted their messages. None of the allegations that they held secret meetings while listening to loud music, that they raised the flow of the Eğertutmaz stream to erase murder traces on Narin’s body, that Salim’s vehicle was seen on the Eğertutmaz stream road around 22:00 at night, is confirmed. Especially regarding the vehicle of Salim, although it appears to be confirmed, this allegation finds room in the reasoned judgment only in the form of an expression of having reached an opinion. The owner, make, and license plate of the vehicle in question have never been determined. Yet, even so, in its statement, the Diyarbakır Bar Association both shares the information that it has not been identified and asserts that, even though it has not been identified, it has been concluded that it belonged to Salim Güran. Yet from the sound recordings on his own phone, it appears that, at those minutes, Salim was not in the vehicle or on that road, but in the village and among people. This is what his lawyer states, and no one objects to this explanation. Nevertheless, the allegations are repeated. In the post-truth era, justice, unfortunately, functions like this, skipping right over the facts… Likewise, although no DNA has been found in the bloodstains discovered in the barn and on the hill, or although the time they were formed has not been determined, it is said that “since it has been clearly established that this is human blood, it belongs to Narin.” Ignoring the fact that the authorities conducting the examination may also have been affected by this heavy disinformation, many pieces of evidence are said to be “compatible” with the information that the murder was committed within the family.\nEven on a normal and calm day, many of us struggle to remember what we ate yesterday, whom we met. Yet every little detail that Enes forgot about the details of his daily life under these circumstances was enough to make him a killer. Abrasions on Enes’s body are again found to be “compatible” with a scuffle with Narin. But if there was a scuffle and there are definite or indefinite marks on unrelated parts of the body, should we not be astonished at how much Enes manages to cram into those 8 minutes and how many people he does all this beside? There are truly gigantic gaps—sinkholes that, if you linger just a little, will collapse and swallow the truth.\nJust now, as I write these lines, there are two thin cut marks on my own hand, very close to my fingernails. One is slightly infected. I have no idea where or how these abrasions occurred. Was it at the hairdresser’s, or when I did a serious cleaning of my cupboard drawers in recent days? Not only this: no matter how I probe my memory, I cannot remember whether we encountered the woman who approached us and said, “Narin came home, she came, she threw her bag on the stairs!” at the village two days after our visit when we were arriving or when we were leaving. I was not under pressure, and I was not tired when I went there that day. But this is what happened. Because in daily life it is difficult for us to remember many things once two days have passed. While this fact is so clear, relatives of the family were declared joint killers due to small differences in their statements on points that may not, in fact, correspond to any significant piece of information. Yet was it not necessary to consider the relationship between the radically different statements that Nevzat gave about what is the only piece of information whose forgetting cannot be explained by mere oblivion and that would be his only guarantee of getting out of this incident unscathed, and the possibility that he might be the one who actually killed the child? At least three times, Nevzat gave radically different statements about where and how he took Narin’s lifeless body from the uncle. This is extremely strange, and yet this distortion by Nevzat was interpreted only in the context of “evidence tampering.” Nevzat, the only person known with certainty to have come into contact with the corpse, was not treated as an “ordinary suspect.” For by the 19th day, when Nevzat’s vehicle was identified from camera footage and his home was raided, the scenario we had collectively constructed in the country had become so convoluted, so enmeshed in “pacts of silence” and countless other theories, that all these theories could not simply be discarded.\nIn other words, by the end, the possibility that “the murderer was the servant”—that is, that it was “merely” a simple abuse and murder—had become unacceptable. So many debates, so many articles, social media posts, and a demonized family and village could not be relinquished. Returning to the point that the villagers said nothing because they knew nothing was not easy. Could it be that all this is for that reason? Yet even a quarrel among the women of the family after the discovery of the body on the 18th day of the incident was enough to convince us that this village was knowingly concealing a lie. Yet up until the 18th day, before the body was found, no one considered the possibility that the women of the village might have been affected by the rumors spreading at wind speed about the relationships between Salim and the mother, Salim and Hediye, Enes and Devran, and Salim and Enes, and perhaps even indulged carelessly in the perverse pleasure of these rumors, just as we all may have done. No one thought that they might be accusing the family with words such as “Go on, keep lying!” under the influence of social media and disinformation, just as we did. No one recalled how often and how quickly the proverbial saying “there is no smoke without fire” is disproved in village life."

    "section": "Perhaps We Were Not Seeking Justice",
    "text": "Perhaps We Were Not Seeking Justice\nOur search for justice in the Narin case has not found a full response. It could not. Because perhaps we were not seeking justice. It is painful to confirm and say this, but perhaps we wanted to take revenge. The revenge of our wasted years under AKP rule. An impossible revenge…\nMoreover, this time, it seemed that all of us—Kurds and Turks alike—were on the same side. On Narin’s side. On one hand, this was indeed a very sincere and genuine partisanship. Yet on the other hand, it was not. Because our need to be vindicated and to take vengeance had suddenly taken precedence over our effort to understand what had happened to Narin. It did not work, because it was not possible to take our rage against the AKP out on that tiny village called Tavşantepe. And indeed we did not. As a result of complex interactions, it was once again the AKP that emerged victorious. It found an opportunity, ostensibly for the sake of justice and ostensibly without regard to anyone’s tears, to punish in the harshest way a state-loyalist family and village that everyone was convinced would be most strongly protected by the AKP and that openly relied on the protective wing of the AKP party-state. It found an opportunity to appear just. In fact, as we saw in the judgment, neither the Güran family nor the village of Tavşantepe had any great power or any immense secret in which the family and the village were jointly involved. They were merely a family and a village whom the AKP could sacrifice without batting an eyelid… The political judiciary rendered its verdict in light of this knowledge. Yet it does not make sense to think that a family could be preserved in boundless secrecy and at the same time sacrificed in this way. This is a story that is not internally consistent in any way.\nSo what happened in the end? The real culprit essentially went unpunished. The AKP, which has been complicit in the killing of children and women throughout its time in power, was, this time, so to speak, exonerated by ostensibly establishing justice without regard to anyone’s tears. Yet it was not the first time that a (Kurdish) child, a (Kurdish) family, a (Kurdish) village was sacrificed in those parts… The words spoken live on air on the very first day of the incident by an AKP MP—words that now make me think he did not really mean all that has since been ascribed to that sentence—“The family are our friends of forty years… There are things we know and cannot say,” likewise contributed, in a sense, to the destruction of a family and indeed a village that was in pursuit of a missing daughter and in a state of horror. All our ready suspicions clustered around that sentence. There, they found a position that confirmed them.\nAnyone who tried to carefully watch the second hearing of the Narin Güran case could have seen that, in this case as well, the verdict had long since been given, just as in the Gezi and Kobani cases and in many political trials. Because a criminal case had acquired an entirely political character. Moreover, this did not happen in the sense implied by the phrase “femicides (in this case, child murders) are political.” It gained its political character not primarily through power relations and gender inequality, but through its capacity to articulate with prejudices, hatred, and rage at the opposing poles of a deeply polarized society.\nThis took place through very complex processes of disinformation and media manipulation. Already, not only in Turkey but around the world, our understanding of the world and events has long since been shaped not by truths and facts but by inverted images and circulating discourses mediated by the media."

    "text": "The Retrospectively Narrowed Base Station Report and HTS Signal Records\nIt appears that the most decisive piece of evidence in the aggravated life sentences of the three family members has been the narrowed base station records. But this is where the problem begins. The narrowed base station analysis is not carried out at the time of the incident or on the day in question but days later. Experts and forensic specialists say that it is very problematic to conduct a retrospectively narrowed base station analysis, especially using the technique referred to as “triangulation” in the supplementary report in the Narin case. Indeed, as has been mentioned in the media, the authors of this supplementary report, which played the most significant role in the sentences, themselves state that there may be deviations of 2 meters and 1 minute. Experts say, “If there is a deviation of one minute, a person can walk 100 meters in one minute.” The narrowed base station records indicate that, at the time of the incident, Salim, Enes, Yüksel, and Nevzat were in the same house, which, given that their homes are in fact already very close to each other and assuming that the deviation in the retrospective narrowed base station analysis is a little more than one minute, makes it highly problematic to overturn “the ordinary course of life” and to allege murder through “joint perpetration” in a way that defies all logic. Nonetheless, since this is a highly technical matter, I recommend that you examine the link[5] I have provided. As you will see, in the special interview at this link, Koray Peksayar, described as one of Turkey’s leading forensic IT experts, and forensic IT expert Att. Levent Mazılıgüney evaluate the HTS narrowed base station supplementary report, one of the most important elements in the Narin case.\nPeksayar states the following: “From the report, we cannot understand what operations the preparers carried out. In Europe, in the USA, or anywhere in the world, I have never heard of retrospectively narrowed base station data being used as in the Narin case. With retrospectively narrowed base data, anyone can be declared a terrorist, a thief, a dishonorable person.”\nMazılıgüney: “Many criminal lawyers say, ‘Such a thing is impossible,’ but due to the sensitivity of the Narin file, they do not comment.”"

    "section": "Problems in the Reasoned Judgment",
    "text": "Problems in the Reasoned Judgment\nThe HTS signal records, which are the “strongest” piece of evidence in the reasoned judgment, are deemed sufficient to make Salim Güran, Enes Güran, and Yüksel Güran joint perpetrators and killers, taking into account the “ordinary course of life,” even though it is accepted that they may deviate by two steps or one minute (and in this situation, one minute may correspond to fifty or even one hundred meters). Without taking into account that Salim’s house and the house of his brother Arif—where Enes and Mother Yüksel live—are 50 meters apart, it is stated that it is certain that Salim was not in his own home but in Arif’s house, which is considered the scene of the crime, based on the HTS signal records. Yet while the HTS records are accepted as definitive evidence that Salim was not in his own home but in his brother Arif’s home or extensions 50 meters away, even though Nevzat’s phone gave a signal as if it were near the scene at the time of the murder, it is said that, due to the proximity of the houses and the possibility of signal overlap, this is not interpreted as if Nevzat were there. Yet Nevzat’s house is further away, 100 meters, and located relatively lower. The wording in the reasoned judgment at this point is as follows:\n\nIt has been established according to the narrowed base data that during the time when the victim Narin left the path and was walking toward her home and then arrived in front of the barn, the defendant Nevzat was near the scene of the incident, but given that the defendant’s home and the home of the complainant Arif are close, this matter has not been evaluated by our court against the defendant.\n\nIn the reasoned judgment, the statements that interpret the three family members as if they jointly participated in the act of killing are also highly problematic. Even though there is no reasonable justification and no sign or indication of such, it is alleged that the act of killing began in the barn or extensions and was completed in the house. Although the defenses mention bloodstains in the barn and on the hill, even these stains are merely described as “possibly belonging to a human.” Even this is not certain. And indeed the evaluation section of the reasoned judgment does not specify them, and there is no evidence whatsoever that they belong to Narin. Perhaps they are very old stains. We do not know. No reasonable information is provided as to why an act of killing would start in the extensions and continue into the house… Thus, every relevant or irrelevant finding is linked together with a kind of certainty as evidence of joint perpetration.\nWe do not initially understand why the judgment scrupulously avoids stating that Narin was killed in the barn or extensions and that her body was brought into the house immediately after death. But it is only under this assumption that all three can be considered to have participated in the act of killing. If either Enes or Salim had killed her in the barn and somehow been caught by the other family members, “joint perpetration” could not be argued. But the notion that family members jointly mastered the situation and moved beyond mere spectator status to actively participate in an act of killing that begins in the barn and extensions and extends into the home has no understandable motive. Neither what they were doing at the time of the incident nor how they took part is in any way clear. It is difficult to accept this assertion as there is no plausible justification for an act of killing that starts in the extensions and continues into the home, nor does it appear possible for such an act to fit into the “8-minute time period” within which the murder is accepted to have taken place. In short, one is left with questions echoing in one’s head: “Why, why, why?” There is not a single reasonable answer to these questions in the reasoned judgment. The fact that the family has no reason to kill Narin, apart from “mysterious, conspiracy-smelling” theories spreading from social media, and that no motive is ultimately attributed to the family does not absolve them from being joint killers. Yet the answer to why Nevzat is not considered a suspect is as follows:\n\nAlthough the other defendants and defense counsel claimed that the victim Narin was killed by the defendant Nevzat; given that there was no animosity or reason that would require the defendant Nevzat to kill the victim Narin, and that in the National Forensic report prepared on the improvement of the Daran-2 camera recordings, there was a moving blur toward the direction of the house-barn, and given that our court accepted that this blur was in fact the victim Narin because the clothing elements were dark and she was perceived as short and thin, in this situation, it is concluded that the victim Narin was killed in the house, barn, or extensions…\n\nThe most serious flaws in the report converge at two points. First, of course, there is no enmity between the unfortunate child and Nevzat, and let us say none between the family and him either, but what about the alleged enmity between his own family and this child? What is the purpose in so tormentingly killing Narin in the barn or extensions and then in the house in a prolonged process involving Enes, Salim, or Yüksel in a joint manner that paradoxically invalidates every individual allegation about each of them? There is no answer to this.\nSecond, as becomes clear, if we do not accept that the blur whose existence is acknowledged in the improved camera recordings by the National Forensic report and which is merely interpreted as possibly being a human is Narin, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Narin had passed by Nevzat’s house and reached her own. Moreover, if this camera can see this blur, should it not also have caught, even as a blur, Salim climbing up the hill to call out to Nevzat within at most three or four minutes (since the total time is very short) or at least Nevzat walking on the same road as Narin back home? If such movement on this road exists, why is it not mentioned? If there is no such movement and the camera is seeing that area at those minutes, then neither could Salim have called Nevzat, nor could Nevzat have gone to Arif’s house to take the corpse. From the evaluation text of the reasoned judgment, it is again clear that the evidence submitted by the defense lawyers, and which makes the HTS records doubtful and appears more convincing—regarding the pedometer data and the defendants’ internet activity at the time of the incident—has not been taken into account in any way. It is explicitly stated that it has not been taken into account. As follows:\n\nOther evidence submitted to the file by the parties to the case—complainant, complainant’s counsel, complaining institutions, defendant and defense counsel—has not been considered by our court as contributing to the concrete incident and therefore is not addressed here.\n\nAccording to the family’s lawyers, during the time of the murder, Salim’s phone shows that he was continuously on the internet and taking very few steps, whereas Nevzat’s internet usage appears so minimal as to give the impression that the internet was only running in the background. Almost nonexistent. Based on this information, one lawyer states that it appears that Salim was indeed in his own home and seen there. Should this not have been taken into account, even a little?\nI saw in the three-day hearing and in the defenses I later read carefully that some of the evidence submitted by the family members’ lawyers was highly significant. Unfortunately, this evidence was neither refuted nor taken into consideration."

    "section": "The Only Statement of Nevzat That Does Not Change",
    "text": "The Only Statement of Nevzat That Does Not Change\nThere is another very problematic matter which is frequently mentioned in the reasoned judgment and in the defense of Nevzat Bahtiyar. The reliability of Nevzat’s statements that the murder was committed by Salim is defended with the following sentence:\n\nIt has been observed that the defendant Nevzat, in the only statement that did not change during all stages, stated that he did not kill the victim Narin and that it was the defendant Salim who killed her and gave the body to him.\n\nYes, the defendant Nevzat, from the moment he was caught (he did not confess; he was caught), while changing almost all of his statements in a way that cannot be rationally explained or justified merely by fear, does not change this one point. Yet is it not precisely for this reason that this ought to be considered highly suspicious? Frequently repeating “Salim killed her and gave her to me,” never stumbling or slipping on these words, and never showing any hesitation in this single point, Nevzat, as can be seen from the defense presented in court and from the defense text attached to the judgment (and as explicitly stated in the reasoned judgment), given that (perhaps because his statements on almost every other point, as he spoke, had to be and would be changed) he speaks very little, gives short answers. He keeps saying, “I do not know,” “I do not remember.” In the sentence in which he claims that before handing over Narin’s lifeless body to him, Salim said, “Narin saw my relationship with Yüksel; that is why I killed her,” he neither stumbles nor makes a slip. Yet when he states that he first saw Narin’s body in the room with foam at her mouth, he does not remember what he himself said, what he did, or anything else. He answers all questions by saying, “I do not remember”… While we see in the reasoned judgment that the unchanging nature of the words “Salim killed her and gave her to me” is presented as proof of the reliability and truthfulness of Nevzat’s statements, why do we not see in the same judgment any mention of the changes in Nevzat’s statements? His fear of Salim is presented as the reason for his inconsistent statements at the beginning, but when Nevzat was caught and gave these statements, Salim was already in prison. The judgment does not address these points at all.\nEven after being asked dozens of questions related to the missing blanket (a blanket whose existence is not actually known with certainty), which come across as highly leading, he still fails to arrive at a coherent explanation. Why, then, should we believe Nevzat? The man whose only consistent sentence is “Salim killed her”?\nAnother extremely grave matter in the reasoned judgment concerns the allegation by Nevzat that “Salim told me he killed Narin because she saw our relationship,” which has turned out to be entirely unfounded and is openly acknowledged in the reasoned judgment. Yet rather than saying “Nevzat lied” in this case, the judgment itself, almost incredibly, pulls Nevzat out of this lie. The judgment, in an extraordinary move, asserts that this lie was “imposed on Nevzat by Salim and the family in order to conceal the real motive.” At this point, things truly become unbelievable. While the entire family—mother, father, Enes, and uncle alike—are repeatedly and vehemently protesting this allegation in court and speaking of it as a grave slander that overshadows their suffering, acting as if there was some other motive or reason for the killing that they were trying to hide, why would they utter this lie to “the stranger in the village” right then and there?\nAs for the expression “stranger in the village,” you can also see it in the initial defense included in the reasoned judgment. The presiding judge has Nevzat (who is alleged to have limited ability to express himself) carefully say, one by one, that he was afraid of Salim and that he was a “stranger” in the village, that he came there later, that the village belonged not to him but to them. I truly ask that you read this defense. Nevertheless, somehow, the “stranger in the village,” that is, Nevzat, first says he has known Salim for 30 years or more and that they have been together since childhood. Immediately afterward, he says, “I am 52 years old; I have lived in that village for 52 years.” These contradictory statements, coming one after the other, are not given even a moment’s attention."

    "section": "There Is Also the Bag and Slippers Matter…",
    "text": "There Is Also the Bag and Slippers Matter…\nAccording to the reasoned judgment, on 21 August 2024, around 15:08, the defendant Nevzat Bahtiyar called Salim Güran and talked for 42 seconds, then left his home. Around 15:10, he is determined to have been on the paved road between the homes of Arif and Salim and near the home of Arif. Around 15:18, he is near the home of Arif. Around 15:26, he arrives in front of Arif’s home. At 15:27, he is in Arif’s house and the extensions, and according to the HTS signal records, he continues to remain in the house until 15:35, then around 15:40, he is near the school area. These are the statements. However, whereas the HTS records are accepted as definitive evidence that he was inside Arif’s house when it is convenient, the HTS signal records that show him to be on the route along which Narin was passing when such an inference would arise are not trusted.\nOf this narrative, taken entirely from the reasoned judgment and to which I have explained at length why I do not assign much credibility, two things are important to me for many reasons nonetheless. First, that Nevzat, according to the HTS call records, calls Salim at 15:08, the call lasts 42 seconds, and he says he went outside at about 15:09. This HTS call record is not an HTS signal record; it is a call record and can be definitively verified. That is, just before Narin is last seen on camera at 15:11, Nevzat, by his own account, goes out to the road where Narin will pass. And, indeed, about ten minutes later, around 15:18, he says that Salim called out to him from the hill. I do not think this is true.\nBecause in the DECRYPTED clip of the National Forensic report, between 15:18:47 and 15:18:50, the intense blurs and bright areas in the house-barn region are interpreted as Narin approaching this area. That is, if Narin appears to have reached there at 15:19 and if Nevzat, with her body, is seen on camera leaving Arif’s house at 15:41:56, the entire incident appears to fit within 22 minutes. Indeed, if this scenario were correct, we would already be accepting the HTS signal records that state that Nevzat entered the house and even the room where Narin’s body was found at 15:27. For the HTS records show him to be there. And the reasoned judgment accepts this information at this point. Moreover, why else would Nevzat be in Arif’s house at that time, a house he says he had only ever gone to once in his life? He goes because he has been called to take Narin’s body and make it disappear. In that case, everything becomes much more grave. For if Narin appeared to be in the barn at 15:19 and Nevzat entered the house at 15:27 to take her body, then, as I mentioned before, everything would have happened in those 8 minutes, and Nevzat would have been inside the house ready to take the body! That is how we arrive at those 8 minutes.\nIf a murder has been compressed into a mere 8 minutes, then the statements relating to these minutes are critically important. Nevzat says he took the slippers that emerged from the sack together with the body, from in front of the entrance door when he left the house with the body wrapped in a blanket that had been handed to him by Salim in a room, and that Salim had given the slippers to him there. We are speaking of a murder that, as the reasoned judgment says, began in the barn or extensions and was completed in the house. Did the child enter the house on her own feet, take off her slippers in the entrance, and then get dragged into the barn? If the child was never brought into the house and was “begun to be killed” in the barn (this cruel expression is, I am sorry to say, used many times in the reasoned judgment, and I am sorry to repeat it), and the act was then completed in the house, what were the slippers doing in front of the entrance door? The slippers should have been either in the barn or, if they had been taken from the barn and intended to be disposed of together with the child, they should have been with the body.\nAs for the bag, Nevzat says that it was hanging around the child’s neck. This also appears to be true. If the child had come into the house on her own feet, taken off her slippers in the entrance and gone inside, was she then dragged from the house to the barn with the bag still around her neck? If she was “begun to be killed” in the barn with the bag around her neck, and then brought into the house, was she dragged into the house with the bag still hanging around her neck? If the bag was intended to be disposed of together with her, why was it not at her side, at her feet, or somewhere in the blanket, but still hanging around her neck? The bag and slippers contradict one another and do not in any way fit the scenario of a killing that begins in the extensions and continues into the house.\nWhen you read the allegations, reports, and finally the reasoned judgment carefully, it is hard not to think that the aim is to confirm the powerful public opinion against the family and the “common conviction,” which from the very first minutes of the incident trampled the presumption of innocence and insisted that the family was collectively guilty of this horrendous murder. It is as if it was desired that the three family members should not leave that house which the culture of social media lynching had set ablaze and that they should not emerge from that fire… We can obtain no other certain information. Strangely enough, it is Father Arif Güran’s own words in court that also give me this thought. He explains somewhat this way why he said “Yes, that is Narin” when he was told that Narin had been found and that there was a child in intensive care in another province, and he was shown a photo. “Both because the child somewhat resembled her and because she was not in good condition, it was not clear. But I said ‘It is Narin.’” The father, sobbing at this point, explains why he said this: “Later, I thought to myself, and I realized that I wanted to find my daughter, I wanted that child in the intensive care unit to ‘be her’,” he says. Those who interpret this very understandable psychological state as evidence of the father’s guilt should also think of it this way: once a public, a society, that had risen up for Narin had made up its mind, did we perhaps read every piece of data as if we wanted “the killers of Narin to be the Gürans”? Unfortunately, this is a plausible explanation. And it is very sad.\nIn short, the village of Tavşantepe easily and effortlessly matched the unimaginable, indescribable, invincible “ghoul” image from Persian mythology that has lodged itself deep in our minds. The gul-i beyabani, the man-eating demon…\nWe projected, in one night, indeed in a single minute, all the evils that have nested in our minds in connection with “that geography” from the 1990s onwards, perhaps throughout the entire Republican period, onto the village of Tavşantepe. From unsolved murders to white Toros cars, from drugs and incest to organ trafficking and arms smuggling, from the Illluminati conjured up from a village at the foot of Zerzevan Castle to prostitution and feudal tyranny—whatever there was, we projected it onto that small village of 200 households. Neither the CHP members, nor the DEM Party members, nor the AKP members had a genuine motivation to protect them and to care for the truth. In fact, it was not only a child named Narin that was lost there, but also a village called Tavşantepe… That is how I see it. I wanted to share this, thinking that perhaps you too might wish to reconsider your thoughts from this perspective. Even if there is only a one-in-a-million share of truth, because we owe this truth to Narin…\n\n\n\nExternal References (5)\n\n\nBirikim: Sevilay Çelenk - We Searched for Narin as if Seeking One Last Way Out (30 September 2024) ↩︎\n\n\nMichel Foucault - Speaking the Truth (Book) ↩︎\n\n\n221B Magazine: Doruk Tatar - The Purloined Letter: The Superficiality of the Secret and the Economy of Knowledge (10 February 2018) ↩︎\n\n\nBianet: News Tagged with Narin Güran ↩︎\n\n\nSerbestiyet: Onur Erkan - INTERVIEW Forensic IT Experts Peksayar and Mazılıgüney: “We Have Never Heard of Retrospectively Narrowed Base Station Data Being Used in Europe or the U.S. as in the Narin Case” (12 December 2024) ↩︎"

    "text": "Av. Ali Eryılmaz ​\n\nTanık İfadelerinin Güvenilmezliği ​\nDiyor ki benim evimde erkek çocukları olduğu için bir yere gezmeye gittiğim zaman ben Narin’i Maşallah’a teslim ederdim, emanet ederdim. Ya bunun altından bir sürü şey çıkartabilirsiniz, ben her zaman olaya şu açıdan bakarım, bazı yerlerde de söyledim bir saat bile günde en az iki defa doğruyu gösterir. Yani bu topluluk, Tavşantepe köyü diyorum ben onlara, isim ya da sayı olarak vermiyorum, 200-300 kişi varlar. Bunların bu 30 küsuru bu duruşmada tanık olarak dinlendi. İçlerinden şu adam ya da şu kadın doğru bir ifade verdi. Evet bu ifadeye biz esas alıp hükümde kullanabiliriz diyebileceğimiz bir tane ifade yok. Hepsi yalanlar ile dolu. Hani dediğim gibi bir saat bile günde iki defa doğruyu gösterir ya, o kadar yalanın içerisinde ifadeleri bir araya getirdiğiniz zaman en az 1-2 tane doğru unsuru yakalayabiliyorsunuz ya da yanlışlıkla ağızlarından kaçırıyorlar. Çünkü her şeyi saklamak mümkün değildir. Gerçek bir şekilde kendini açığa çıkacaktır. İşte bir cümle evde erkek çocuklarım olduğundan hep ben Narin’i Maşallah’a bırakırdım. Buyurun, buna ben yorum yapmıyorum. Yorumu size bırakıyorum. Nasıl yorumlamak isterseniz.\n\n\nRojin Davası ile Narin Davasının Karşılaştırılması ​\nDiğer bir mevzu yine bu dava kadar meşhur bir dava var önümüzde. Henüz dava aşamasına geçmedi. Savcılık soruşturması devam ediyor. Van’da öldürülen Üniversite öğrencisi Rojin. Maalesef o kadar duygulanıyorum ki, orada bir baba var. Ben de bir babayım. Avukat olmadan önce bir babayım. Rojin’in babası kaybolduğu günden bugüne kadar çalmadık kapı bırakmadı. Arandığı günün ilk gününden itibaren her gün orada yattı, kalktı asker ile beraber. Ben o manzarayı hiç unutamıyorum. Sabah geliyor askerler, adam gidecek bir yeri yok. Sahil kenarında bir yerde yatmış. Çocuğum belki çıkar, gelir diye. Mantığa bakın ya, düşünceye bak, zihniyete bak. Bu adam çalmadık kapı bırakmadı. Bu aile, Kabaiş ailesi hala da koşturup duruyorlar. Kendine tutunacak bir dal arıyorlar. Basın mensuplarından, vatandaşlardan ve devletten. Bu aile de eğer aynı şeyi yapmış olsaydı, kaybolduğu ilk günden itibaren kendi aralarında gizli toplantılar yaparak olayı örtbas etmek yerine, tanıkları susturmak yerine, döverek ya da delilleri karartmak yerine çıkıp da Narin’i gerçek anlamda aramış olsalardı, toplumun nezdinde bu insanların yeri şimdikinden daha farklı olacaktı. Baktı ki toplum, bu insanlar Narin’e sahip çıkmıyorlar, işin içerisinde iş var, dolayısıyla Narin’in bütün ailesi 85 milyon oldu.\n\n\nAvukatların Davadaki Rolü ve Kamu Davası Yaklaşımı ​\nBuradaki ailesi Narin’in avukatı olarak bulunuyor, seyirci değil bunlar, bizde lafı geliyor kendimize sanık vekiliyiz. Biz de Narin’i savunuyoruz kendi açımızdan. Neden? Gerçek katil ortaya çıksın. Müvekkilimin katil olmadığı kanıtlansın. Biz de o anlamda mücadele ediyoruz. Bir nevi biz de Narin için çalışıyoruz. Diğer vekil arkadaşlarımı bilemem. Ve bu davada girdiğimiz günden bugüne kadar meslektaşım da dahil biz bunu bir kamu davası olarak üstlendik. Beş kuruş menfaat uğruna biz bu davaya girmedik. 4 gündür burada kalkıp yatıyoruz, kendimiz yeyip içiyoruz, otel paramızı kendimiz veriyoruz, uçak paramızı kendimiz veriyoruz. Hiçbir menfaatimiz de yok. Tek istediğimiz şey gerçek ortaya çıksın çünkü her şeyin para olmadığını biliyoruz. ve benim de dediğim gibi çocuğum var ve bu dava gibi bu ülkede çok dava var. Umarım benim yaptığımı, bizim yaptığımız davranış diğer bütün Narin gibi, Rojin gibi davalarda avukat arkadaşlara örnek olur. Sadece toplum kurumlar olarak barolar değil, serbest avukat arkadaşlarımız da bu davaya gönül verirler, farklı açıdan bakabilirler. Dolayısıyla Rojin eğer bu aileye bir örnek teşkil etmiş olsaydı, Rojin’in ailesinin yapmış olduğu gibi hareket etmiş olsalardı, emin olsunlar, şurada oturan kalabalık Narin için değil, Adalet için suçluyu şu ya da bu ya da değil, gerçek için burada otururdu, Narin’in avukatlığını yapmazlardı. Dolayısıyla Narin bizim kızımızdır demesinler, Narin onların kızı değil. Narin şurada oturan 85 milyonu temsil eden insanların kızı. Onlar için artık öldü. Onlar o 8 yaşındaki gencecik kız çocuğuna sahip çıkmaya dahi cesaret edemediler. Hala da edemiyorlar. Katilin kim olduğunu içlerinde biliyorlar. Mağdur rolü oynuyorlar. Yani şu mağduriyet filmini oynayabilmek için üç tane karakter seçseniz bunlar kadar güzel oynayamazlar. Bir tiyatro ustasını getirip drama dersi vermeniz lazım ama para bol, belki de drama dersi almışlardır. İçeride, dışarıda, köyde onu da yapabilirler.\n\n\nAilenin Maddi Durumu ve “Er Ryan’ı Kurtarmak” Benzetmesi ​\nPara çok bunlarda. Satacak daha 400 dönüm tarlaları var. Sata sata bitecek o tarlalar. Yargıtaydan bu dosya gelene kadar sata sata biter o tarlalar. Savunma yapıyorum kesme. Spielberg’in çok güzel bir filmidir. Bir grup asker takım asker Ryan ismindeki bir askeri abluka altından kurtarıp canları pahasına, ölme pahasına kurtarmak için verdikleri mücadeleyi anlatan güzel bir film ve sahne de çok gerçekçidir. Bu mahkemede sanık tarafının oynamış olduğu senaryoda aynı Er Ryan’ı kurtarmak filmine benzetiyorum ben. Bunu mecazi anlamda kullanıyorum. Enes’i kurtarma filmi, yani Enes’i kurtarmak için bildiğiniz bir film hazırlamışlar kafalarında.\n\n\nEnes’i Kurtarma Çabaları ve Delil Karartma ​\nKoskoca bir köy kaç kişilik insan var bilmiyorum, 200-300, bir araya gelmişler. Biz nasıl bu Enes’i bu işin içerisinden çıkartır, kurtarırız. Ellerinden gelen her şeyi yaptılar. Döve döve, söve söve, parayla insanları kandırarak, etki altına alarak, insanları yanıltarak, tanıkları yanıltarak, delilleri karartarak. Ya düşünün 3600 kişilik insan 19 gün boyunca Narin’i aradı. 50 tane drone, 2 tane İHA, 20 küsur köpek, onlarca makine. Türkiye Cumhuriyeti’nin en büyük kurtarma operasyonu yapıldı ama buna rağmen bir karış toprakta, o bir karışık yerde o kız bulunamadı. İmkansız bulunamaması. Neden bulunamadı? Narin aranırken yanlış hatırlamıyorsam 95 sahte ihbar, 2 tane yangın, büyük yangın. Sanığın akrabalarının evinin önünde yangın. Narin’in terliğinin aynı renginde ve modelinde bir yerlerden terlik bulma, işte kırmızı beyaz arabalar, gelen giden vs. Tanıkları yanıltmak, jandarmayı yanıltmak. Eğer bu davranışlar olmamış olsaydı Narin o devletin üstün çabası ile ilk 3 gün içerisinde bulunurdu. Ama bunlar Narin’in bulunmasını da istemediler. Yani bir halt kabahat işlediler, suç işlediler ve o kız çocuğunun bulunmaması için ellerinden geleni yaptılar. Ne umdular? Belki bulamadan çekerler, giderler. Biz bu işten kurtuluruz ya da hasbelkader bulunursa bile o zamana kadar deliller kaybolur, suyun içerisinde akar gider. Bize ait bir şey çıkmaz, biz de bu işten yırtarız diye düşündüler ama kurdukları hikayenin sonu umdukları gibi bitmedi. Şu anda burada oturuyorlar, bitmeyecek de.\n\n\nKaybolma Saatinin Sürekli Değişmesi ve Cinayetin Şekli ​\nSayın Salim Güran Muhtar ilk komutan ile kızın kaybolmasının ardından yapmış olduğu konuşmada kızın kaybolduğu saat için 15:00-15:30 saatlerini veriyor. İlk konuşmadan sonraki konuşmasında bu 15:00, 15:30, 16:00, 16:30 oluyor. Sonra ki konuşmasında 17:00-17:30 oluyor. Eğer bir konuşma fırsatı verseydiniz bu 17:30, 18 mi 19 mu olurdu bilmiyorum artık. Sürekli kaybolma saatini farklı saatler olarak değiştirmeye çalıştılar. Bir şeyleri ört bas etmeye çalışıyorlar. Bu apaçık ortada. Peki bu kadar şeyi niye yapıyor bu köy? Yani 200-300 kişilik bir köy ve bu üç sanık neden böyle bir çabanın içerisine giriyor? Nevzat’ı kurtarmak için mi? Nevzat kim ki? Kendi ifadeleri, Nevzat bunların kapısında köpek olamaz. Tavuklarına kış kış bile diyemez. Evlerinin önünden geçemez. Kendi ifadeleri ve bu kadar örtbas etmeyi, delil karartmayı Nevzat için mi yapacaklar? Her şey ortada. Bu bu suçu işleyenler bunlar. Peki bu Nevzat’ın bu ailenin içinde ne kıymeti var? Ne değeri var? Bir de şu açıdan bakın, cinayetin oluş şekline baktığınız zaman ani gerçekleşen bir cinayet bu. Savcı hanım da tasarlamadan dolayı değil, anladığım kadarıyla ona istinaden bir mütalaa hazırlamış. Ani işlenen bir suç. Yani bir anlık olup biten bir suç ve dolayısıyla ailenin içerisinde işlenen bir cinayet olduğu çok açık. Aile içerisinde işleniyor bu cinayet.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Suça Dahil Edilmesi ve Rolü ​\nNevzat’ın bu cinayete ne katkısı olur? Sevilmeyen bir adam, neydi ne demişti birisi, Arif miydi? O kadar fesat bir insanmış ki Nevzat, ailece bağlarını kesmişler. Enes savcılık soruşturmasında ne diyor? Nevzat bu işi yapabilir. Eğer Salim tehdit ettiyse ya da para verdiyse bu işi yapacak kadar işte kötü kötü laflar söylüyor. Böyle bir adamdır diyor. Yani Nevzat’ın bu suça nasıl gireceğini de zaten kendileri çok iyi biliyorlar. İki şekilde sokabilirler bunu. Ya tehdit ederek sokarsınız bu adamı suça ortak edersiniz ya da para teklif ederek. Çünkü maddi durumu iyi değil. Bildiğiniz sıradan bir sıvacı. Karnını zar zor doyuran bir adam. Bunlardan alacağı 50 bin lira, 100 bin lira ya bile ihtiyacı olabilir, yapabilir. Ee dolayısıyla suça da iştirak etti, cinayete iştirak anlamında demiyorum. Bu suça onu da soktular sonunda. Peki neden Nevzat diyorlar? Ya köyde bir sürü insan var, bir sürü insan varken neden Nevzat’ı çağırdı Salim, cenazeyi Nevzat’a verdi? Kendi savunmalarından örnek vereceğim, o gün düğün için herkes köyden gitmiş. Köyde kimse kalmamış. Sözde köyde kimse kalmadıysa ve Salim’in en yakın, en iyi arkadaşı, samimi dostu Nevzat ise aralarından sır akmıyormuş. Bütün ifadeler, tanık beyanları da dahil, aynı şeyi söylüyor. Yedikleri, içtikleri bir gitmezmiş ve 10 dakika, 9 dakika önce de telefonla konuşuyorlar, telefonla konuşuyorlar. Salim neyi biliyor? Nevzat evinde. Ben Nevzat’ı biliyorum diyor, ben onu kontrol ederim, ne dersem yapar. Çağıracağım ilk insan Nevzat tabi, ağabeyleri yok,kardeşleri yok, çocukları yok. Hepsi davetiye dağıtmaya gitmiş. Sonuçta kimi çağıracak? Nevzat’tan daha iyi kukla bulabilirler mi? Bulmuşlar, yaptırmışlar. Dolayısıyla Nevzat’ın bu cinayetin içerisinde iştirakçi olarak bulunabilmesi için aile ile olan ilişkileri dikkate aldığınız zaman hiç sebep yok. Hatta tam tersi. Böyle işin için Nevzat ancak vasat tarafını işte cenazeyi alıp götürüp bir yerlere saklamak için adi işleri yaptıracak kadar da güçlü insanlar. Dolayısıyla Nevzat’ı bu konuda çok güzel kullanmışlar. Er Ryan’ı kurtarmak dedim ya sayın başkanım. İfadelere baktığınız zaman ifadelerde çok enteresan bir şey var. Şöyle bir durum var, Narin kaybolduğu ilk günden itibaren bu arkadaşlar, bu sanık arkadaşlar bir gayretin, bir çabanın içerisine girmişler. Nasıl bir gayret bu kendilerine her zaman aralığında bol bol tanık yaratmışlar. Belirli insanlar varmış da onlar ile buluşmuşlar, o gelmiş, bu gitmiş. Kendilerine tanık üretmeye çalışmışlar. Bakın çok ilginçtir, saat 15:00 ile 16:00 arasında 1 saat içerisinde, Salim o zaman içerisinde tam 7 kişi ile muhatap olmuş. Yüksel Güran 9 kişi ile muhatap olmuş, bu 1 saat içerisinde Enes Güran 16 kişi ile muhatap olmuş. Bir saat içerisinde Nevzat ise üç . O üç kişi de kim biliyor musunuz? Eşi Gazal, Salim ve Yüksel. Cesedi alıp götürme anında, şimdi bakın 1 saat içerisinde Enes 16 kişi ile muhatap oluyor, belki de 1 hafta içerisinde köyde görebileceği insan sayısı kadar insan ile, 16 kişiyle 1 saat içerisinde muhatap olmuş. Orada oturmuş, burada görmüş, şurada görüşmüş, şurada konuşmuş. Hani bir de şu gerçek var. Hani bu köyde herkes davetiye dağıtmaya gittiydi? Bu kadar insanı siz nereden buldunuz konuşacak? Bu kadar insanı tanık yapacak? Bu kadar insanı nasıl buldunuz? Aradaki çelişkiliyi anlatabildim mi sayın başkanım? Hem düğün davetiyesi dağıtmaya gittiler, hem de bu kadar tanığı kendilerine şahit olarak uyduruk tanığı, yalancı tanığı oluşturabildiler. Ama Nevzat’ın bu davada farklı bir önemi daha var.\n\n\nNevzat’ın İfadeleri ve Güvenilirliği ​\nDavanın başladığı ilk günden bugüne kadar sanıkların, diğer sanıkların yapmış olduğu tek şey Nevzat’ı suçlamak, katil odur demekten başka hiçbir şey yapmadılar. Nevzat ne yaptı? İfade değiştirdi diyorlar. Ya evet toplam en son mahkemede verdiği ifade ile birlikte 3 defa ifade değiştirdi ama bu değişen ifadenin içerisinde sabit olan bir kaç unsur vardı. Her zaman cesedi Salim verdi ve her zaman dedi ki bana Salim şundan dolayı öldürdüm dedi diye söyledi. Yani öldüren kişi ve sebebini söyledi ve kimden aldığını söyledi dolayısıyla Nevzat’ın vermiş olduğu beyanların birbirleri ile farklı olması davanın esası açısından çok şey değiştirmiyor. Bizim önümüzü açan asıl ifade Nevzat’ın ifadesi. Sayın savcım da zaten mütalaayı kurarken kısmen Nevzat’ın ifadelerini dikkate alarak kurmuş. Bakıyorsunuz baz raporlarını hazırlayan arkadaşlar Nevzat’ın ifadesini dikkate alarak baz raporlarını hazırlamışlar. Bazı unsurlarda Nevzat’ın o değişik, farklı dedikleri ifadeler bile bu mahkemede itibar görmeye layık ifadelerdir. Diğerlerine baktığınız zaman onlar da defalarca ifade değiştirmişler ama hangi ifadesini hükme esas alacaksınız? Mümkün değil ayırt etmek. Dolayısıyla Nevzat’ın vermiş olduğu ifade bu mahkemede huzurunda bizim açımızdan itibar görebilecek tek ifade, tek savunmadır. Diğer deliller ile ilgili tartışma konusuna girmeyeceğim. Tek tek delilleri burada tartışmayacağım. Hazırlık yapmıştım ancak dün sayın meslektaşım eski baro başkanımız Nahit Eren, delilleri o kadar güzel ortaya koydu ki, bütün çıplaklığı ile ortaya koydu, ben şahsen sanık Nevzat Bahtiyar vekili olarak o delillerin karşısında konuşmaya haya ederim ve o yüzden de ben diyorum, benim açımdan o yüzden.\n\n\nBilirkişi Raporlarının Güvenilmezliği ​\n\nİmzalar ve Ciddiyet Eksikliği ​\nÖnümüzde şimdi bir cinayet davası var. 4 kişi bu cinayetten dolayı yargılanıyor ve siz bilirkişi olarak bu 4 taneyi cinayetten yargılanan kişinin dosyasına bir bilirkişi olarak atanıyorsunuz. Ben bu bilirkişilerden bazı şeyler beklerim. Ufak tefek bir dava değil bu, hani 50-100 bin, 500 bin, 1 milyonluk dava dava olsa kaybedersiniz, para gider tekrar kazanılır ama sonuçta ömür boyu hapis yatacak, 4 tane insanın hayatını etkileyecek bir davaya bir rapor sunuyorsunuz. Dolayısıyla ben bilirkişi olarak sizden beklediğim bazı şeyler olur. Nedir bunlar? Öncelikle samimiyet, sonra ciddiyet, sonra denetlenebilirlik ve en sonda bilimsellik beklerim. Bakıyorum raporlara, samimiyet ve ciddiyet anlamında bakıyorum, fark etmişsiniz belki, dilekçemde belirttim ama arkadaşlar da burada duysun diye söylemek istiyorum. İki ayrı rapor var elimizde. Birincisi kök rapor, diğeri ek rapor. Her iki raporda da ayrı ayrı sayfalarda paraflar var. Normalde bizim resmi olarak paraf diye bir şey yoktur. Bizim sistemimizde her sayfaya imzamızı atarız. 4 sayfalık bir dilekçe yazdıysak her sayfaya imzamızı atarız. Siz de hakim olarak her sayfaya imza atarsınız, paraf atmazsınız. Bakıyorsunuz her sayfada paraf var. Paraf imza yerine geçmez. Hadi geçti diyelim, onu da kabul edelim. Her paraf birbirinden farklı efendim. Hiçbir paraf birbirini tutmuyor. Parafları da geçelim dedik, yani hadi altı üstü paraf ne olacak. Bakıyorsunuz en son kısma, yani sonuç kısmının altındaki imzalara bakıyorsunuz, iki raporda da 6 tane imza var. Her birisi birbirinden farklı. Hiçbir imza birbirini tutmuyor. Yani siz bir rapor hazırlıyorsunuz, hazırladığınız rapordaki ciddiyete bakar mısınız? Attığınız imzalar bile birbirinin aynı imzalar değil. Kaldı ki ben eminim, yani incelediğimiz kişiler de aynı şeyi söyledi. Bu imzalar aynı imzalar değil. Bir kişi atmış bu imzaları. Farklı farklı bir kişi atmış imzaları. Geçmiş imzalar sahte belki de bilmiyorum. Bu kişilere ait de olmayabilir. Cumhuriyet Savcılığına bu konuda şikayette bulunduk. Şu anda soruşturma devam ediyor ama hangi aşamada o konuda bilgim yok.\n\n\nVeri ve Ölçüm Hataları ​\nDiğer bir örnek, yine bakın hep rapordan gidiyorum, ek rapor istediniz, şeyden bilirkişiden. Bize ek rapor gönderdi dedi ki, nasıl yaptın bu ölçümleri? Bize bir anlat. Bizi ikna et ki içimiz rahat olsun. Kabullenelim bunu. Böyle bir rapor yapılırmış, kabullenelim. Bakıyorsunuz efendim, rapor içerisinde bilirkişinin koyduğu fotoğraflara bakıyorsunuz, fotoğrafı görüyor musunuz? Baz haritaları fotoğrafı Kırşehir’e ait efendim. Kırşehir iline ait baz fotoğrafını baz istasyonu fotoğrafını Tavşantepe köyü ile ilgili olan bilirkişi dosyasına koyuyor. Yan tarafına da bir Google haritası koymuş, üzerinde hiçbir şey, hiçbir bilgi vermiyor. Teknik olarak demiş, bakın demiş, ben şöyle bir program kullanıyorum. Bu program bunları yapıyor, ekran görüntüleri vermiş. Ekran görüntülerini inceliyorsunuz, başka bir yere ait. Tavşantepe köyüne ait değil. Ya ben şimdi ne beklerim? Sen bir bilirkişi olarak gelmişsin, burada iki gün ayrı ayrı inceleme yapmışsın, demişsin ki, oraya gittim, ölçtüm. Burayı ölçtüm, şunu yaptım, bunu yaptım, raporu hazırladım. Ya en azından şuraya koyacağın veriler şuraya koyacağın fotoğraflar Tavşantepe’ye ait olur ama yok. Ama kadar ciddiyetsizler, bu kadar samimiyetsizler. onu da geçtim. Diyorlar ki, biz bu ölçümleri yaparken herkes tarafından bulunabilecek 3 program kullandık. O programların isimlerini de yazmışlar. Ben bir tanesini cebime indirdim. Kendi cebime indirdim. Diğerini de eşimin cebine indirdim. Check etmek için. O programa bu arada 1800 TL de para verdim. O çok pahalı, ahım şahım bir program da değilmiş. Elimde tutuyorum programı, açıyorum, benim eşimin telefonu sizin ki gibi Iphone. Iphone 14 kullanıyor. Benimki uyduruk eski bir telefon. Camı da çatlak, hala değiştiremedim. Programı açıyorum, benim telefonumun aldığı sinyal gücü ile eşimin telefonunun aldığı sinyal gücü birbirinden farklı. Aynı bazdan faydalanıyorlar ama telefonu kalitesi ve modelinden kaynaklı ikisinin de aldığı sinyaller birbirinden farklı. Aynı programı kullanıyoruz ve bu program bilirkişilerin verdiği program. Sayın başkanım, bu program ile yaptım bunu. Burayı da geçiyorum, peki gittiniz Tavşantepe köyüne. Nevzat’ın evinin önünde ölçüm yaptınız. Öbür tarafında da ölçüm yaptınız. Salim’in oraya çıktınız, yaptınız. Arif’in oraya çıktınız, yaptınız. Değerler ölçtünüz, mesafeler ölçtünüz, baz istasyonunun uzaklığını ölçtünüz. Ya şuraya bir geçin, deyin ki, biz Nevzat’ın evinin önündeki sinyal gücünü şu olarak bulduk, frekans aralığı şuydu, baz istasyonuna uzaklığı şu kadardı, yaptığımız hesaplama şudur. Ha biz de deriz ki, gideriz biz de ölçeriz ve oradaki veriler ile karşılaştırırız. Aynı mı, değil mi ama bakıyorsunuz dosyada böyle bir bilgi de yok. Yaptıkları ölçümlere ilişkin bir satır bilgi yok.\n\n\n\nNevzat Aleyhindeki Tek Delil: Güvenilmez Baz Raporu ve Güvenilir HTS Raporu ​\nDaha sonra ne yapıyor bu arkadaşlar? Bilirkişi raporunu hazırlayan arkadaşlar, benim müvekkilim Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın şu davada iştirak halinde cinayete iştirakten yargılanmasına sebebiyet veren tek delil, bak tek, başka hiçbir delil yok, bir tane diğer sanıkların bir tane tanık ifadesi yok, bir tane DNA yok, ya da başka ne ararsanız aleyhinde şu baz raporundan başka bir tane delil yok, Nevzat hakkında ve çıkıyorsunuz bir raporla bir insanı bir cinayete iştirak etmiş gibi gösteriyorsunuz. Bir cümle ile 15:10 ile 15:18 arasında Arif ile Salim’in evinin oralarda geziyor. Ama ben müvekkilime soruyorum, var mı böyle bir şey? Allah Kur’an nimet çarpsın, diyor. Ben evimin oradaydım. Şimdi ben böyle uyduruk bir rapora mı güveneyim yoksa müvekkilimin söylediği beyana mı güveneyim? Baz raporları ile ilgili söyleyeceğim şey bu kadar. Dolayısıyla baz raporunu kabul etmiyoruz, sebeplerini açıkladık. Ama şu HTS raporu var elimizde. Şu rapora hiçbir diyeceğim yok. 22 yıllık Avukatım, girdiğim yüzlerce davada şu HTS raporu delil olarak kabul edilip hükme esas alınıp insanların cezalandırıldığını gördüm, çok gördüm ve Yargıtay tarafından da kabul edilen inkar edilmeyen bir uygulama. Ama şuna geldiğimiz zaman maalesef onu söylemem mümkün değil. Hani biz bu yargılama, bu cinayet yargılaması deneme tahtası mı? Bu üçüncü davaymış, burada deneniyormuş, yav gidin bunu ufak tefek suçlarda deneyin ya. Hırsızlık suçunda deneyin, araba çalıntı davalarında deneyin. Deneyin oluyor mu tutuyor mu, doğru mu, değil mi? check edin. Ha ondan sonra getirin 4 tane yargılanan insanın cinayet davasında kullanın. Yani böyle basit bir dava değil ki. Deneme tahtası gibi bu raporlar bu hesaplamalar bir davaya esas olsun ya da kullanılsın. Dolayısıyla imzalardan tutun da içerisindeki diğer hususları dikkate aldığınızda biz bu raporun hükme esas alınabilecek bir nitelikte, bir hukuki belge olduğunu kabul etmiyoruz. Hukuki belge olmaktan çok uzak bir belgedir.\n\n\nHediye Güran ve Suçlu Sayısının Artışı ​\nSavunmamın içerisinde daha önceden Hediye vardı. Hediye Güran ile ilgili çok güzel şeyler anlatacaktım. Hatta bu suça iştirake sokacaktım. Hatta 4 kişi değiller 5 kişiler diyecektim. Sayın Nahit hocam imamı da kattı, 6 kişi oldular. Bilmiyorum biraz daha kurcalarsak 7-8-9 olabilir. Bilmiyorum artık yeni baz raporları çıkarsa diğer köydekiler ile ilgili baz raporlarını birleştirirsek bütün köy olabilir bence o da mümkündür. Hediye ile ilgili savunmamı yapmayacağım. Sizin ile en son yapmış olduğum görüşmeden sonra ben mutmain oldum ve Hediye’yi savunmamdan çıkartıyorum ve geliyorum müvekkilim sayın Nevzat Bey’in yakalama anına.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Teslim Olması ve Salim ile Yoğun Telefon Trafiği ​\nJandarma Kamera kayıtlarını inceledikten sonra, kamera kayıtlarında gelen kırmızı arabayı tespit edince kırmızı arabanın sahibine bakıyorlar. Sahibi Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın oğlu çıkıyor ve oğlunu almak için eve gittiklerinde, arabayı tespit edip oğlunu almaya gittiklerinde eve, Nevzat Bahtiyar diyor ki, aradığınız kişi oğlum değil benim deyip kendisi teslim oluyor. Yatağın altında, yorganın üstünde, işte sandıkta falan çıkmadı yani. Kendisi kapıya çıkıp aradığınız kişi benim diyerek teslim oldu. Diğer bir mevzu Salim Güran ile 3 ay boyunca toplam konuşma sayıları 45’miş. 45 defa konuşmuşlar. Bu iki günde bir konuşmaya tekabül ediyor. İki günde bir ben öz ağabeyim ile bu kadar konuşmuyorum. İki günde bir, beş gündür buradayım daha ağabeyimi aramadım ama bunlar o kadar samimiler ki, iki günde bir konuşacak kadar. Hani 3 ayda 45 konuşma, az değilmiş yani.\n\n\nSanıkların Delil İsteme Stratejisi ve Su Kesintisi Tartışması ​\nDiğer bir mevzu, Onur bey şöyle bir ithamda bulunmak istedi gibi anladım sanki, doğru yanlış bilmem. Hakkıdır, savunma yapıyor. Hani onlar bir sürü delil istiyorlar, biz onu da istiyoruz, bunu da istiyoruz, şu delili de getirin, bu delili de getirin, DARA’yı istediler. DARA’da bir şey çıkmadı. Onu istediler, bir şey çıkmadı daha yeni yeni şeyler istemeye devam ediyorlar. Neden istiyorlar bunları? Şahsi kanaatimiz, içinden bir şey çıkmayacağını biliyorlar ve mahkeme heyetine diyecekler ki, bakın bütün delilleri toplattık, onu da aldık, bunu da aldık, hiçbir delil çıkmıyor aleyhlerine diyecekler. Kendilerine çıkmayacak deliller ile meşguller yoksa davanın esasına yarayacak hiçbir delil yok. İçerisindeki sizde çoğunu reddettiniz zaten, biz savunma açımızdan çok da doğru bir karar verdiniz. Suların kesik olma meselesi, ben bunu tartışmaya değer bile görmüyorum. Müvekkilim sular kesikti diye iddia ediyor. Sanık Salim de evet diyor. Sular kesikti, o yüzden su için aradı diyor. İnkar etmiyor. Artık bunu tartışacak bir noktası kalmamış. Yani DSİ’den gelen raporda akıyormuş, akmıyormuş falan. İkisi de itiraf ediyorlar, kabul ediyorlar, olay bitmiş.\n\n\nAdımsayar Verilerinin Güvenilmezliği ve Soğukkanlı Cinayet Delili ​\nAdım sayar çok önemli. Çok önemli bir noktaya geldik. Adım sayar. Şimdi telefonlarımıza uygulama yüklüyoruz. Adım sayar isminde belki çoğumuzun cep telefonunda yüklüdür bu program ama öyle bir program ki adım sayar elinizle taşırsanız farklı ölçüm yapıyor, cebinize koyarsanız farklı ölçüm yapıyor. Çantada taşırsanız farklı ölçüm yapıyor. Bu kadar farklı ölçen bir alete ben adımlarımı saydırırken ne kadar güvenebilirim? Salim Güran o telefonu taşırken neresinde taşıdı, nereden bileyim? ya da iki eliyle bir şeyler yaparken telefonu belli bir süre 15-20 dakika bir yere koyduğunu nereden bileyim? çünkü Allah rahmet eylesin Narin’in o cansız bedenini oradan oraya taşırken, getirirken, götürürken delilleri elleri ile yok etmeye çalışırken muhtemelen o telefon zaten iki elinden birisinde olmadığı kesin. Bir yere koymuştur. Dolayısıyla da biz o adım sayarlara da inanmıyoruz. Hatta benim çok güzel bir lafım var. Bu adım sayarlar ile ilgili hani 45 adım kalmış ya, efendim olay saatlerinde 45 adım yapılmış. Çok güzel bir roman ismi olur. Mükemmel bir roman ismi. 45 adımda cinayet demiştim. Aynen öyle. 45 adımda cinayet. Bu davanın özet iddiası da bu olabilir yani. Diğer bir mevzu banka ödemesi. Cinayet saatinin olduğu saatlerde bir iki tane banka ödemesi var. Bu banka ödemesi nasıl açıklarım, nasıl izah ederim? Bunun ötesi, gerisi yok. Benim açımdan Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın avukatı olarak benim açımdan bu banka ödemelerinin tek bir anlamı vardır. Salim Güran ya soğukkanlı bir katildir. Soğukkanlı hani Soğukkanlı bir katil profili çiziyorlar ya müvekkilim için asıl soğukkanlı kendisi. Cinayetin işlendiği saatlerde iki tane fatura ödeyebilecek kadar soğukkanlı. Olayın olduğu güne ilişkin son sözlerimi söyleyeceğim, bitireceğim sayın başkan, sizi daha fazla sıkmayacağım.\n\n\nNarin’in Son Konumu ve Cinayet Mahalli ​\nMüvekkilime isnat edilen bir iddia vardı. Narin tepeyi tam çıkmak üzereyken aldı Nevzat götürdü, ahırda boğarak öldürdü dediği iddiaları vardı. Bu iddialar duruşmada ve duruşma öncesindeki ifadeler ile Narin’in kız arkadaşlarının beyanları ile ortaya çıkmıştır ki Narin o saatlerde tepeye çıkmış. Kaldı ki keşif görüntülerinde bu ortaya kondu. Dolayısıyla Narin’in Nevzat’ın olduğu patikanın üst kısmı, çıktığı evinin olduğu yere geldiği kesinleşti. Aynı zamanda elimizde Ulusal Kriminal raporu var. Ulusal Kriminal raporunda da “olduğu düşünülüyor” diyor ama deliller ve ifadelere baktığımız zaman artık Narin’in o tepeyi çıktığı, bizim açımızdan kesinleşmiştir ve Narin’in çıktığı yere bakarsanız sayın başkanım, Kriminal gösterilen noktaya yere bakarsanız eğer o nokta aslında bize cinayet mahallinin neresi olduğunu çok güzel gösteriyor. Tepenin üzerine çıkmış, ortadaki boş alanın ortasına gelmiş Narin. Onların evinin giriş sağ tarafta, girişin sağ tarafını geçmiş ahıra doğru gidiyor. Dolayısıyla ölümüne sebebiyet veren ne olduysa gördüğü en son gördüğü en son şey ne ise o şey ahırda ya da ahırın etrafında bir yerde oluyordu. Dolayısıyla cinayet mahalli bizim açımızdan da ahırdır.\n\n\nCinayet Saati ve Nevzat’ın Tahliye Talebi ​\nCinayetin saatine gelince, bitiriyorum, bizim açımızdan cinayetin saatine gelince 15:11’de patikaya girdi. 2 dakikada yukarıya çıktı, 15:13. 2 dakika ahırın olduğu bölgeye gelsin, 15:14. 15:14’te ne gördüyse gördü. Ölüme sebebiyet verilen şeyi 15:14’te gördü. 8 yaşındaki bir çocuğu öldürmek boğmak en fazla süreceği 2 dakikadır ve benim şahsi kanaatim o kızcağızın ölüm saati 15:16’dır efendim. 15:16’da Narin bu dünyaya gözlerini yumdu. Daha fazla konuşmayacağım, mütalaaya bakarak hukuki boyutun cezai ve hukuki boyutuna ilişkin savunmayı meslektaşım yapacak. Bu iştirake girer mi, girmez mi bu konuda değerlendirmeleri o yapacak. Ben son taleplerimde bulunayım. Müvekkilim Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın cinayete iştirak ettiğine ilişkin somut ve kesin bir delil, dosya kapsamında şu ana kadar bulunamamıştır ve müvekkilimin dosyada isnat edilen suçun vasfının değişme ihtimali de yüksektir. Bu nedenle mahkemenizin kararıyla beraber tahliyesini de arz ve talep ediyorum.",

    "text": "Av. Mahir Akbilek ​\n\nBilirkişi Atanma Usulü ve Yemin Tutanaklarındaki Eksiklikler ​\nSayın heyet, biz sayın iddia makamının esas hakkındaki mütalaasına iştirak etmiyoruz. Ben başlık başlık gideceğim. Şu an daralan baz çalışması ile ilgili görüşmelerimi ve savunmayı açıklayacağım. Yemin tutanağından başlamak istiyorum. Sayın başkanım, 3 Eylül 2024 tarihli yemin tutanağı, bildiğiniz üzere ceza muhakemesi kanunun 64. maddesi bilirkişiler atanma usullerini belirler. Sıkı şekli şartlara haiz bir maddeden bahsediyoruz. Sıralar burada yemin metni de aynı şekilde ifade edilir ve biz maddenin lafzından anlarız ki, atanan bilirkişi yeminden sonra başlamak durumundadır. Bir kez yemin ile yetinilebilir, yani ardışık bir görevlendirme olursa aynı ana konuyla bağlantılı ikinci yemine hacet yoktur ama yemin başlangıç için gerekli mantıklı da. Zaten 3 Eylül 2024 tarihli yemin tutanağı 2024/46201 bütün problemlerin sebebi olan soruşturma dosyasının numarası burada adı geçen Mustafa AKARSLAN, Mukaddes SÜS, Hasan ÇAM bilirkişi olarak görünen kişilerin imzaları görünmüyor metinde. Ancak iki unsur iki husus var. Birinci husus, bilirkişinin itiraz üzerine ve sayın mahkemenin resen belirlediği sorulara cevap olmak üzere gönderdiği ek raporundaki açıklamadan yararlanırsak, eğer bilirkişinin iki sahaya gittiği anlaşılıyor 29 ve 30 Ağustos 2024 birinci tur, 8 ve 9 Eylül 2024 ikinci tur. İkinci turun sebebi Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın yokluğunda çalışma yapılmış olması. Mantık gereği çünkü Nevzat Bahtiyar 8 Eylül’ü 9 Eylül’e bağlayan gece yarısından önce. Bu dosyada kapsamında cumhuriyet savcıları da dahil, bilinmiyor olması gerekiyor. Dolayasıyla bilirkişiler de Nevzat Bahtiyar’ı bilemeyeceğine göre eksik şüpheliler temelinde bir çalışma yapmış olsa gerek. Birinci problem yemin etmemişsin. Nereden biliyorsun göreve başlayacağını? Bu nasıl bir öngörü yeteneğidir? 29 Ağustos’ta gidiyorsun, hangi yetki ile gidiyorsun? Kim seni yetkilendirdi? Zaten senin hangi ilin bilirkişi listesinde olduğun tam bir muamma. Varsın, odalardasın, gidiyorsun, geliyorsun birileri ile görüşüyorsun. Silahların eşitliği ilkesi yok. Biz senin var olduğunu dahi bilmiyoruz ama müvekkilim Enes Gürün hakkında da aslında aleyhe ifade veren tanıklarsınız, bizim açımızdan tanıksınız. Siz iddia ediyorsunuz.\n\n\nBilirkişi Raporunun Meşruiyeti ve Delil Niteliği ​\nMüvekkilin Nevzat Bahtiyar ile aynı evin içerisinde belirli zaman döngüsünü iddia eden sizsiniz. Evrakınız bilirkişi raporuna haiz değil, sizi sorgulayamıyoruz, sizi göremiyoruz. Önce göreve başlayıp günler sonra yemin ediyorsunuz. Yemin tutanağında imzanız yok, bir sıkıntı daha var. O çok büyük bir sıkıntı zaten. Aynı yemin tutanağının altını okudunuz mu? Der ki, yazıyı ve ekindeki soruşturma dosyasını teslim aldım. Kim bunu der? Bize göre tanıklar. Bizim açımızdan bunlar tanık. Mustafa AKARSLAN, Mukaddes SÜS, Hasan ÇAM 3 Eylül 2024. Şimdi bu tanıkların bilirkişi görünümlü tanıkların kendi ek raporlarındaki ilgili kısmı okuyacağım. “Narin Güran cinayeti ile ilgili olarak dosyada bulunan HTS kayıtları ve Salim Güran’ın ilki ifadesi dışında herhangi bir delile temas edilmemiş, ifadelerden örnek alınmamış ya da kamera kayıtları ile ilgili tutanak alınmamış olup sadece sahada yapmış olduğumuz çalışmalar sonucu elde edilen veriler raporlanmıştır”. 3 Aralık 2024 kimden sadır olduğu belli olmayan imzalar, aynı 3 tanık. Sayın başkan, kimin aklı ile oynuyorlar? Böyle bir usul yok. Var mı? Bu mu? Meşru mudur veya savunulur mu? İnsan bunu savunur mu? Bir hukukçu bunu savunur mu? Bunu savunan neyi savunduğunu da bir araştırsın bir zahmet sonra bunun içerisindeki görüşlerin teknik olarak doğru olup olmadığını konuşuruz. Şekli yönden bilirkişi heyetinin kuruluşu ile ilgili seramoniye uyulmaması yönünden, yasayı hiçe sayması yönünden usul yasamızı hiçe sayan bir oluşumdur bu, bir belgedir bu. O başlı başına bir sorun, başlı başına bir problem. Yasak delil yani özetle yasak delil sayın mahkemenin yapması gereken bir ara kararla dosyanın dışına atmasıdır. Düzenleyen kişilere doğru geri göndermesi gerekiyor. Takdir sizin tabii ki. Gelelim takip ettiği bilimsel metoda. Öyle demiş ek raporunda. Bize kızmış. Demiş beni nasıl eleştirirsin diyor. Ben öyle bir çalışma yaptım ki diyor, içinde diyor, bir kırıntı yorum yok bulamazsın diyor. Ya içinde böyle bir kırıntı taşımayan biyoloji kitabı yok, sen nasıl bir dehasın sen ne buldun Japonya’nın bulmadığı, Çin’in bulmadığı ki vatandaşları neredeyse nöral çip takacak, adamlar bunu tartışıyor.\n\n\nBilirkişi Metodolojisinin Bilimsel Dayanağı ve Alternatif Çalışmalar ​\nBizim teknolojik seviyemiz ortada, yani şimdi, yani Allah’ın bildiğini kuldan mı saklayacağız? Teknolojik seviyemiz ortada. Böyle bir imkan olacak, bu davayı mı bekleyecek yani? O kadar kumpas davası olmuş, o kadar kamuya önem olmuş, dava olmuş canlı yayınlanmış bu davayı bekleyecek, ondan sonra hiçbirimiz de konuşamayacağız. Böyle bir şey yok. Kıymetli çalışmalar var. Sayın başkanım, bizi üzen buna tartışmasız iman etmemizin beklenilmesi oldu. Bu bizi çok üzdü çünkü tam anlamıyla kanıtlanmamış, formüle dönüşmemiş her uygulandığı noktada aynı sonucu verecek kesinliğe erişmemiş hele hele bu kadar kıymetli, bu kadar önemli bir alana nüfus edecek, gelecek dahi etkili olacak bir delillendirme metodunu tartışmadan, etmeden kabul etmemizin beklenilmesi bizi çok üzdü. Savunuldu da, çok ciddi savunuldu. Tartışmamız tartışıldı. Nasıl tartışırsınız diye. Zaten bilirkişinin ekstra tartışmasına gerek kalmadı. Yani kaynağını kendisi gösteren bir bilirkişi şu anda kaynak ben diyor. Şimdi bir eser yazarsınız, bir bibliyografya yaparsınız, bir eser bir makale yazarsınız hakemliği olur, dayanaklarınızı tek tek gösterirsiniz. Dayanaklar siz olamazsınız. Birinci kural başka insanlar başka çalışmalar dayanak gösterirsiniz. Biz sizi böyle denetleriz. Bu rapor dayanak olarak kendini gösteriyor. Bizzat benim diyor. Dayanak bir kitap daha var. Bu şekilde kıyas kabul etmez değil mi? Kıyas kabul etmez. Sayın Nazlı Güney hocamızın 2020 tarihli, geçerliliğini halen koruyan bir çalışması ve ortak bir çalışma sayın Levent MAZILIGÜNEY, sayın Koray PEKSAYAR ve sayın Berker KILIÇ adli bilişim uzmanı. Adli bilişim uzmanı yüksek mühendis, adli bilişim uzmanı yüksek mühendis, Hukukçu. Ne güzel unvanlar yazıyor. Gizli saklı bir şey yok. 10 Haziran 2020 tarihli bir çalışmadır bu. 10 Haziran 2020 tarihli bir çalışmadır, bu çok kapsamlı bir çalışmadır. Meslektaşım Mustafa Demir celse arasında sunduğu itiraz mahiyetli esasen tevsi tahkikat talepli ve kendi içinde itirazları da barındıran dilekçesinde bu çalışmayı da ek olarak sunduğu için ben sadece çok özet, çok çok özet geçeceğim. Çalışma prensip olarak şunu söyler. Der ki, HTS terminalleri, HTS baz kuleleri, HTS terminalleri petek sistemi ile genelde Türkiye içerisinde inşa edilir. 10 km’lik aralıklar ile konumlandırılırlar. Amaçları iletişimi daha sağlıklı bir hale getirmektir.\n\n\nHTS Verilerinin Güvenilirliği ve Daraltılmış Baz Çalışmasının İddiaları ​\nKesintisiz iletişimi sağlama iddiası var. Çok temel bir şey unutuldu. Bunlar GSM Şirketleri. Bunlar şirket yani. Bu bilgi teknoloji kurumu ile karıştırılıyor. Aslında sanırım bu veriler sayısal halde bilgi teknoloji kurumuna teslim edildiğinde arada bir denetim mekanizması yok. Yani anladığımız anlamda da bir kök imza, bir e-imza yok. Bir denetleme kurulundan geçip geçerliliği ve bilimsel ilkelere uygunluğu denetlendikten sonra kamuya veya yargı makamlarının değerlendirmelerine yollanmıyor. GSM şirketi isteneni kendinde tutuğu veri kaynağında BTK’ya gönderdikten sonra BTK onu sadece formülize edebiliyor. Gönderiyor mahkeme dosyalarına, HTS raporları dediğimiz raporlar şekline geliyor. HTS raporları sonucu elde edilen baz verilerinin bile delil yeteneği, delil gücü, ispat gücü tartışmalıyken ve yargıda mutlak delil, kesin delil tek başına hüküm tesisine elverişli hükmü daha kabul edilmezken daha bunun tartışması sürerken bunu aşıp bir de sadece kullanıcının, mobil kullanıcının belirli bir HTS terminaline bağlı olduğu adres ve anı ve ki o an da HTS raporlarında artı eksi 5 dakika riski barındırır, yani biz çok spesifik bir konu olarak önümüze çıkmadığı için henüz bunlar bize denk gelmedi. Biz tartışma gereği duymadık fakat literatürde o verilerin, o ham verilerin bile artı eksi 5 dakika yanılma payı ile kabul edildiği, ilgilileri bunu bilir, bu şekilde kullanırlar, bu verileri daraltılmış baz çalışması ise bi on adım daha ileri geçerek; der ki ben senin geçmiş tarihli bir konuşmandan bir veri trafiğinden yararlanarak HTS terminalinde gömülü bulunan, yani orada kayıtlı bulunan verilere erişim, ben burayı biraz sonra söyleyeceğim, kayıtlı bulunan bir veri de yok. Çünkü ve senin geçmiş tarihli konum baz konum bilgilerinden faydalanarak senin bir metre bir metre sadece fark ile ve iki metre mesafe farkı ile 1 dakika zamansal fark ile ben senin yerini kesin bir şekilde söylerim. Zamanın hiçbir önemi yok. Yeter ki elimde senin o tarihe ilişkin elimde HTS kaydı olsun diyor. Bu mümkün değil. İmkanı yok. Canlı yaparsın, o da ne şartla? Araştırdık.\n\n\nGSM Şirketlerinin Konum Bilgisi Depolama Yetkisi ve Teknolojik İmkanları ​\nHukuken mevzuatımızda GSM şirketleri yani tacir olan GSM şirketlerinin bu yönlü kişilerin bu konum bilgilerini kendi veri bankalarında depolama gibi bir yetkileri bulunmadığı gibi böyle bir yetki bulunmadığı gibi böyle bir mekansal ve teknolojik imkanları da yoktur. Çünkü bahsettiğimiz Mazılıgüney hoca ile yüz yüze görüşme fırsatı bulduk. Bu konuyu konuştuk. Hassaten, hocam var mıdır böyle bir veri bankası? Elon Musk’ınki gibi, böyle Microsoft’unki gibi TB’larca? biz hala GB konuşuyoruz ya, TB’lar daha da ötesi böyle bir veri depolama bankası yok. Kötü haber, yok yani. Buradan kastım yok, üçgenleme yapacaksan senin elinde iki kesin veri olacak. O verilerden bir tanesi sinyal gücü, ikincisi de açı. Bu ikisi kesin olacak. Yani bunlar tartışılmaz olacak ve bunlar depolanmış olarak sana sunulacak. Böyle bir kurum yok. BTK’da böyle bir teknoloji yok. BTK’da resmi olarak böyle bir teknoloji yok, GSM şirketlerinde de yok. Nereden getirdiniz bu verileri? Yok getirmediniz aslında. Bilirkişi gidip sahada normal bildiğimiz tekerlekli metre ile veya duvarcıların kemerlerine bellerine taktıkları mekanik metre ile, en fazla lazer metreler ile önceden tespit ettikleri harita üzerinde tespit edebildikleri HTS kulelerinin yerlerinden ve kulelerin kimliklerinden faydalanarak, aslında o kulelerin kendi, aslında o kulenin sinyal gücünü biliyor, bulabilirsin doğrudur veya o kulenin senin tahmini duracağın yere olan açısını. Çünkü bilirkişi sahaya girdiğinde, atıyorum Enes Güran’ın ifadeleri alınmadığını varsayıyoruz ya, sayın başkanım ifadeleri bilmiyor zaten bilirse peşin gidip kılıf uyduracaksın, etki altında kalacaksın, o yüzden diyor ifadeleri almamışım. Yanıma tahmini bir yerde durup cep telefonu ile şahit arama ve mesaj gönderme şeklinde veri transferi başlatıp kule ilgili arasındaki açı ve sinyal gücünü hesaplayacak, burada senin yapacağın canlı konum tespitidir. Sen canlı konum tespiti yapmaya çalışıyorsun. Senin yaptığın şeyin yemek sepeti şirketinin yaptığı şeyden farkı yok ve o esnada da aldığı kendi kullandığı, cebinden çıkartıp örnek için kullandığı cep telefonun bir sinyal gücünü ölçsün de hepimiz de görelim. Açsın, açsın onun sinyal Iphone’lar DAABS gruplarında ölçülebiliyor.\n\n\nBilirkişi Çalışmasının Geçersizliği ve Enes Güran’ın Beyanı ​\nSayın başkan, açsın bakalım bir dakika içinde sinyal gücü değişiyor mu? Değişmiyor. Durduğu yerde kımıldamasın, hiç kımıldamasın. Yerinde sabit kalsın, bakalım senin metnin kutsal mı, değil mi! Tartışılmaz mı, değil mi! göreceğiz. Senin kendi cep telefonundaki değişecektir. ABS tabanlı Iphone kullanan var ise açsın baksın. Dediğimiz doğru çıkacak. Dolayısıyla böyle bir teknolojisi yok. İnanmak isteyen inansın. bu şimdiki teknolojik imkanlar ile mümkün görülmüyor. Ne yazık ki mevcut delil yöntemleri ile klasik bildiğimiz bilirkişiler ile devam edeceğiz. Bu arada sayın başkan normal şartlarda HTS daralan çalışması bizim müvekkilin kaba tabirle hesabına gelir. Konuttadır, uyuduğunu beyan etmektedir. Uyuduğuna yönelik beyanını destekleyen değişik yaş aralıklarda akrabaları mevcuttur. Yine aynı konutta ikamet etmeyen birinci derece kan hısımı olmayan bir başka uzak akrabası da bu beyanı desteklemektedir. Telefonu da hareketsizdir. GPRS hareketlerine bakılırsa baz verisinin olmadığı, GPRS hareketli olduğu anlaşılacak ama GPRS hareketli de bu arada güvenilir değil. GSM şirketler 8 saate bir kayıt yapıyor. Onu da araştırsa arkadaşlar iyi olur. Yani oradaki kimliklendirmeler de bu kadar net isnatlarda bulunmaya elverişli değil. Şu an bunlar, bu teoriler doğru olsaydı bir çok yargılamaya gerek kalmazdı. Zaten robotik yargılamalar yapılırdı. Baz raporunun diğer dosyadaki diğer deliller ile maddi deliller ile çeliştiği yerleri meslektaşlarım daha önceki celsede uzun uzadıya anlattılar. Sayın başkan, o kısımla ilgili her ne kadar benim sanığım olmasa da, benim müvekkilim olmasa da raporun ciddi çelişkisine en azında görünür çelişkisine dikkat çekmesi açısından belki çok kısaca değinebilirim, Salim Güran’ın gece vakti bir araç ile kimliği belirlenemeyen bir araçla gömü alanı olarak tabir ettikleri noktaya gittiği yönlü iddiası birden fazla maddi delil ile çürütüldü. Yani teknolojik bir aygıta ihtiyaç duymaksızın çıplak insan beyniyle denetlenebilir deliller ile çürütüldü. Bunun da ötesi yok. Zaten ha kaldı ki bunu ileri sürenler o aracın içerisinde andıkları sanığın olduğunu ileri sürenler keşke daha dikkatli DARAN-2 kameralarını inceleseydiler.\n\n\nSalim Güran İddiaları ve Ortak Faillik Tartışması ​\nO aracın ışıklarına bakmışlar herhalde sadece araç hareketliliğinin gömü alanı olarak belirledikleri yerdeki duraklama süresi onlara garip gelmiş anlaşıldığı kadarıyla, ama o aracın hareketliliğini takip etseydiler o aracın aslında arayanla, benim kendi görüşümdür bu arada, etrafında çünkü sivil insanlarda görünecek gece karanlığında siluetler insan olduğu belli olan şahıslar görünecek, bunlarda ellerinde ışıklarla muhtemelen cep telefonu ışıklarıdır veya küçük taşınabilen ışık üreten cihazlardır, aslında arama tarama faaliyeti yapıyorlar bekleneceği üzere, aracın da hareketi dikkatle izlenirse görünecek ki yönünü değiştirip ışıklarını açıyor, bekliyor sadece. Orada durmuyor. Bağlamından da koparmayı başarmışlar, sanki araç direk geldi, hiç kestirmeden düm düz geldi, orada durdu gibi yapmışlar. Bu da şık olmamış çünkü takip edilebiliyor. Kamera kaydının öncesinde duruyor. O yerinde sabit duruyor. Şimdi sayın başkan esas hakkında mütalaa ile ilgili müşterek faillik meselesi açıklamaya muhtaç bir konu. Burada da çok enteresan bir yeni bakış açısı geliştirilmeye çalışılıyor. Yasa koyucunun iradesi aşılmaya çalışılıyor, yasa koyucunun iradesinin aşıldığının kendi tanımlarından biliyorlar. Hukukçu 37/1 yardım eden ile ilgili bir maddeden ayırt edebilir veya azmettirme ile asıl maddi faili şeriki bu kavramları bilir. Bilmemesi beklenemez. Burada müşterek faillik kurumu ile ilgili iki kurucu ayak olduğu tartışmasızdır. Sunulan hem iddianameye hem yanılmıyorsam esas numarası sunulmamış karar ve esas numarası sunulmamış ancak bir ceza genel kurulu kararının içtihat metninin içinden kesilip alınmış ve esas hakkında mütalaanın ilgili paragrafına eklenmiş bir tanım kısmı ki normaldir bu çünkü Yargıtay Ceza Genel Kurulu zaten Yerleşik İçtihat oluşturur, İçtihat birleştirme mekanizmasıdır. Bir kere oluşturulduktan sonra o görüşten vazgeçene kadar o metninden faydalanılır. Onda bir gariplik yok ama esas ve karar numarası ile tarihinin belirtilmesi daha doğru olurdu kanaatindeyiz. Nitekim zaten esas hakkında mütalaa benim görüşüm demek değil mi benim görüşüm anlamındadır bana göre bence anlamına geliyor, nasıl olduğunu siz karar vereceksiniz yani tam olarak isnat eylemlere\n\n\nMüşterek Faillik Kurumunun Tanımı ve Uygulanışı ​\nŞimdi sayın başkanım, esas hakkındaki mütalaa, katılan kurum vekillerinin yazılı savunmayı ibraz eden ve onu sözlü olarak mahkemede tekrar eden kıymetli vekillerin, yine katılan bakanlık vekillerinin aynı şekilde yazılı ve sözlü müfrez savunmalarında bana göre atladıkları çok açık olan, gözden kaçması da mümkün görülmeyen eksiklik müşterek faillik kurumunda sadece fiil ögesinin tartışılamayacağıdır. Orada sunduğumuz benim sadece esas ve karar numaraları ile tarihlerini belirteceğim ceza genel kurulunun içtihat birleştirme kararlarında, içlerinde açıkça görüleceği üzere hem kararda sizin birleşmeniz gerekiyor ki bu ön koşuldur. Bir suç işleme kararının icrası öncesi bir karar olacak. Manevi unsur sonra eylemi tartışacağız. Sonra eylem söz konusu olacak. Evet, doğrudur. Kanun koyucu eylem aşamasında ikinci aşamada gerekirse müşterek failin fiile doğrudan iştirak etmemesi halinde dahi cezalandırılabilmesini belirli şartlar altında aksi halde azmettirmekten bahsederiz. Yönlendiriyorsun, çünkü emir ve komut altında veyahut suçun sonrası suçun tamamlanmasından sonrasında ise senin eylemine bakarız. Yardım eden misiniz, suçluyu mu kayırıyorsun, arkasından delilleri mi topluyorsun ayrı bir tanımdır. Ayrı bir ama müşterek fail önce kararda birleşecek, bu uygulayıcı tarafından tespit edilecek. Bu kararda birleşti. Örneğin bir kişi yanına tabanca alır, Ahmet’i öldürmek üzere bir saik oluşturur. Bunu genel kasta dökecektir. Mehmet’i de çağırır, gel sen de benim ile Mehmet’e Hasan’ı çağırmış olsun. 3 ettiler. Öldüreceği kişi de bir kafeterya da iç kısımda oturuyor olsun. Kamuya açık bir alanda bu kafeteryanın içerisinde başka şahıslarda olsun başka vatandaşlar da oturuyor olsun. Hakikaten içeriye iki kişi içeriye girsin, bir kişi dışarıda kalsın. Kapının önünde gözcülük dediğimiz unsuru gerçekleştirsin. Tabanca ile ateş edecek, asıl maddi fail ile birlikte içeri giren kişi de tabanca olmasın, bir bıçak olsun ve oturan diğer şahıslara doğru o bıçağı çevirip biraz sonra gerçekleşecek eyleme karışmalarını, onu önlemelerini veya faile saldırmalarını engellemiş olsun. Eylem bu şekilde tamamlansın, fail amacına ulaşsın, maktul öldürülsün, şahıslar yakalansın. Evet burada müşterek faillikten bahsederiz.\n\n\nOrtak Faillik İddiasının Somut Olaydaki Yetersizliği ​\nEvet, fiil üzerinde hakimiyet tesis edilmiştir. Şu anki uygulamamız da böyle bir yargı silsilesi sonucunda yerelde verilecek olan mahkumiyet kararı onanacaktır. Şimdi somut olaydaki tespitiniz sayın iddia makamı, bu yönlü bir tespit midir, bu şekilde bir tespitten mi bahsediyoruz? Yani daha somutlaştıralım. Enes, Nevzat, Salim ve Yüksel nasıl, hangi yöntemler ile, ne şekilde olduğunu tespit etmiş olduğunuz şekilde Narin’i öldürmek kararı aldılar? Bu kararı tespit ettiniz, deliller ile de bunu gösterdiniz. İddianamenizde daha sonra da mütalaanızda daha sonra bu kararın icrası kapsamında da fiile başladılar. O fiilde iş bölümü de olabilir. Demin verdiğim örnek de olabilir. Faillerden bir tanesi mekanın dışında da bekleyebilir ama yasa uygulayıcı ona da bir rol biçecektir. Diyecektir ki, belki de maktul kaçabilecekti, sen o kapıyı tutarak maktulun de seni görebileceği bir nokta da durarak maktuldeki kurtulma umudunu yok ettin. Sen de fiil üzerinde hakimiyet tesis ettin. Doğrudur. Somut olayda bunu mu hedeflediniz, böyle midir tespitiniz? Çünkü biz iddianame ve mütalaayı defalarca okuduğumuzda tespit göremiyoruz. Hatta net gözle görünür bir senaryo da yok, bu da çok can sıkıcı çünkü bir kasten öldürme eyleminin yargılaması yapılıyor şu anda. Senaryo şart, senaryo şart. Bir senaryo olacak, o senaryoya da sujeler tek tek tek yargılama sürecinde oturacak böylece işte 100% kesin dediğimiz hiç kimsenin karşı çıkamayacağı o sonuç ortaya çıkacak. Manevi unsur tespiti yok, fiilin nasıl gerçekleştiğinin tartışılma gayreti yok, olası faillerin, yasada olmayan bir kavram, olası fail yok, olası kast var, olası fail yok. Ama olası faillerin peşinen fail kabulü ile ne şekilde fiil üzerinde hakimiyet kurduklarını, yargı yolu dahil her evre ve aşamada açıkça gösterecek olan hangisinin hangi eylemi ile bu fiil üzerindeki o baştan tespit ettiğiniz fiil üzerindeki hakimiyetini ortaya koyacak bir anlatı dahi yok. Yargılamada benim kastettiğim buydu sayın başkan. Ben bunu kastettim yoksa hiçbir şekilde yargılamayı uzatma gibi bir niyetim yoktu, amacım yoktu. Erken bitmesi de benim hesabıma gelir, eve daha erken giderim, daha az yorulurum çünkü çok olağan dışı bir yargılama yapıyoruz.\n\n\nYargılama Sürecinin Anormalliği ve Beraat Talebi ​\nÇok kıymetli ama çok olağan dışı, hakikaten çok olağan dışı, bari değsin bari ettiğimiz çıkacak sonuca değsin. Yoksa canlandırmalı keşif talebimin bir nedeni vardı. Sayın başkan, sayın iddia makamı ortaya bir senaryo koymadığı zaman işte sanıklar senaryo koyarlar ortaya, hatta tanıklar gelir senaryo hatta aslında birlikte açılması gereken dava tefrik olur. Orada kalan ana dosyada ana soruşturma dosyasında kalanlar kalan sujeler bu yargılamaya getirdiler. Burada tanık olarak ifade verirler ama bu bile dışarıda tartışılır. Bunları nasıl getirtirsiniz buraya? Bunların nasıl beyanını alırsınız? Bunlar zaten bu dosya kapsamında ana dosyada beyanları var ve bunlar yargılanıyorlar. Bunların bir kısmı cezaevinde bunların tanıklık beyanının ne değeri olabilir? Bu aşamadan sonra düzeltilebilir mi, dikiş tutar mı, bundan bir elbise çıkar mı? Bunu zaman gösterecek. Bize göre bir yolu var elbette. Sayın başkan ceza genel kurulunun üç, bize göre bir yolu var. Elbette sayın başkan ceza genel kurulunun üç kararı bize göre çok şey anlatıyordu. Müşterek faillik kurumunu nasıl uygulanmasını gerektiğini, çünkü 37’den başlayıp anlatıyor, çok böyle A’dan başlayıp Z’ye kadar geldiği için iyi bir postulattır, iyi bir reçetedir. Mota mot uygulanabilir, kıymetledir. Onları yazılı olarak ibraz etmiştik sayın heyetinize. Ben oralara girmeyeceğim. Özetle sanık Enes’in nasıl gerçekleştiği iddianameden ve mütalaada anlaşılamayan eyleme, suç oluşturan eyleme hangi vasıflarla ile hangi suç oluşturulan eylemleri ile iştirak ettiği, iştirakçinin görünüşü keza hiçbir cinayet bir saniyelik de olsa bir karar alınmadan işlenemeyeceğine göre o kararı o nasıl iştirak ettiğine tespit olunmaksızın az önce eleştirdiğimiz yöntemle müşterek faillik olarak değerlendirilip sayın heyetten de bu değerlendirmenin kabulünü kamu adına talep ve mütalaa edilmiş ise de bunun reddedilmesi gerektiği görüşündeyiz. Tabi iddianame iade sebebidir aslında. Birinci celse izah etmeye çalıştım ama tabi yargılama ilerleyecekti, görünüyordu zaten. Biz de teslim olduk. İlerlesin bakalım, devamında anlatırız. Şu anda ise beraat sebebidir. Tercih sizin yani bu aşamada artık iddianame iade edilemeyeceğine göre sübut tartışılır. Sübuta kadar geldik çünkü onu tartışacağız.\n\n\nDARAN-2 Kamera Kayıtlarının Değerlendirilmesi ve UKB’nin Hataları ​\nDARAN-2 kamera kayıtları, sayın başkan, DARAN-2 kamera kayıtları UKB deşifre klibi, tabi UKB deşifre klibi dışında normal vatandaşlar inanılmaz video yorumları, çevrileri yaptılar. Bu ham görüntüler bir şekilde kendilerine ulaştı. Demek ki, medyaya ulaştı, gazetecilere ulaştı. Bir şekilde bilişimden anladığını düşünen vatandaşlar sosyal medya üzerinde kare kare değerlendirme yaparak iyileştirdiklerini iddia ederek görüntüleri çoğunlukla akla ziyan görüşler sergilediler. Bezen de akıl çelici. Bu olabilir mi? Buna benziyor hakikaten bir takım şeyler gördüklerini iddia ettiler ve bu görüntüleri paylaştılar. UKB deşifre klibindeki problem bize göre DARAN-2 kamerasının aslında Arif Güran’ın evinin olduğu açıyı doğru tespit edememiş olması, bize açıyı doğru tespit edemeyince kameranın mesafesinin hedef mahalle mesafesinin çok uzak olması, anladığımız kadarıyla kameranın çözünürlüğünün de görece düşük olması gibi sebepler ile elde edilen ham verinin nispeten kalitesiz olması sonucunda Narin olduğunu değerlendirdiği karartının, hareketli karartının durduğu yeri ahırın önü olarak belirlemiş ise de görüntüler tekrardan incelenirse ve DARAN-2 kamerasının açısı tespit edilerek bir bu bakış açısı ile bakılırsa aslında ahırın yan duvarının görüleceği, evin görünemeyeceği, evin bir kısmının görülebileceği, en önemlisi yamacın göz artık görünmeyeceği, Arif’in evinin bahçesinin devamı gibi görüneceği çünkü topografik olarak kamera artık o eğimi göremeyecektir, algılayamayacaktır. Yakınlaştırdığınız zaman ki algılayamıyor, dolayısıyla bizim bir iddiamız, evet o karartı insan hareketine benziyor, doğrudur. Bize göre o karartı Narin değil, o karartının durduğu yer ahırın önü değil. Ayrıca biz iki karartı daha gördüğümüzü düşünüyoruz. Bir karartı Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın evinin hemen sırtında görüyoruz. Yamacında ortalarında Nevzat’a olabilir bir kadına da benziyor. Uzman bilirkişi görüşüne ihtiyaç var. Teknik bilirkişi görüşüne ihtiyaç ve aslında Narin olduğunu tahmin ettiğimiz patikadan çıktığını değerlendirdiğimiz bir karartı daha var. O karartının yukarıya doğru değil, Nevzat’ın ev ve eklentisinin arkasında, arkasında diyoruz çünkü sırtında da olabilir. Yamacın ortalarında da olabilir. Bakış açısı ile ilgili bir şey.\n\n\nKamera Görüntülerinin Savunma Bakış Açısıyla Yeniden Yorumlanması ​\nOnun ona seslendiğini değerlendiriyoruz çünkü orada duruyor, tepenin üstünde olduğunu ve UKB’nin Narin zannettiği karartı aşağı doğru iniyor, aşağı doğru geliyor. Yamaçtan aşağı doğru. UKB onu ne zannediyor? Arif’in evinin bahçesinden ağaçlara doğru geliş zannediyor. Öyle değil. Bakış açısı. Bu kadar basit işte. Bir perspektif eşyaya nereden baktığın sonucu kadar etki edebilir ve biz Narin’in, Nevzat’ın evinin olduğu yakın bölgeden seslenen kişiye doğru gittiğini değerlendiriyoruz. Böyle düşünüyoruz, en azından böyle hissediyoruz. Bu şekilde gerçekleşebilir. Mümkün, mümkün bir senaryo gibi görünüyor. Peki sayın mahkeme nasıl yapacak bunu? Hiçbir şey yapamayacak çünkü karar aşamasındasınız. Karar vereceksiniz. Tevsi tahkikat süreci bitti. Esas hakkında mütalaaya karşı şu anda savunmalarımızı sunuyoruz size. Artık kararınızdan sonra biz kendi imkanlarımız ile bu görüntüyü iyileştirmeye çalışacağız. Aslında sonuç beklediğimiz yerler var, üniversiteler kurumlar var. Yetişmeyecek gibi görünüyor. Zamansal olarak çok mümkün değil gibi görünüyor. Bir vatandaşın bize gönderdiği bir çok kısa bir video var sayın başkan. Kroki var, bir de video var. İzin verirseniz onu slaytta oynatalım. 1.5-3 dakikaya tekabül eder. Sesli yorum yapıyor. Sesi keseriz. O onun kendi yorumudur çünkü o kendi yorumudur.\n\n\nÜç Boyutlu Görüntü Analizi ve Mekan Yorumları ​\nBakış açısına getiriyor. Şimdi sayın başkanım üç boyutlu görüntüyü kameranın göreceği şekle getirince bahçe denilen yerin aslında yamaç olduğu anlaşılacak. Yeşil işaretlediği yer Nevzat’ın evi ve eklentisi. Orası yamaç aslında, bahçe değil. Ahırın önü falan değil. Dikkat ederseniz ahırı yan duvardan göreceksiniz. Çatı zannedilen beyazlık da ahırın yan duvarı. Zaten ahırın ön duvarı dardı yana göre. Bu bize göre biraz garip geliyordu. Açıyı düşününce mantıklı geldi. Artık sebebini anladık. 15:12:38’de çağırıyor yanına, sağ üst köşede Narin olduğunu düşündüğümüz, patikayı bitirmek üzere olan da Nevzat olduğunu düşündüğümüz. Perspektifi görüyor musunuz? Ev sanki daha öndeymiş gibi görünüyor. Şu ahırın önünde görmüş olduğunuz kişi UKB’nin tespit ettiği kişidir. Aşağı ve yukarı gider. Nevzat’ın evinin üstünde kadın olduğunu düşündüğünüz bir şahıs daha var. Yüzünün Narin’e dönük olduğunu düşünüyoruz. Bu arada kameranın özellikleri düşük bir niteliğe sahip olması sebebiyle hareketleri geç yakalama söz konusu. Kameradaki görüntüye yakalanan bir şahıs yönünü çevirdiği anda birden fazla kişi dahi görünebiliyor. Görüntü yakalaması geç bu kamera kaydının. Yamacı bahçe olarak görüyorsunuz. Yamaca gelecek aşağı doğru inecek.\n\n\nMevcut Delillerin Reddi ve Enes Güran ile İlişkilendirme Eksikliği ​\nSayın başkan, mütalaada değinildiği için çok kısa kısa geçeceğim başlıklar mevcut. Örneğin mitokondriyal DNA raporuna konu kıl örneği meselesi. Bu delil doğrudan Enes’i ilgilendiren bir delil değil, kendisinin kıllarının tespit edilen uzunlukları dikkate alındığında onu doğrudan ilgilendirmez. Bu sebeple bu delilden yola çıkılarak herhangi bir senaryo ile herhangi bir farazi kabul ile eylem ile Enes arasında illiyet bağı kurulması hukuken mümkün olmadığından bunu ifade etmekle yetineceğiz. Jandarmayı dinlemek, elektrik tellerini birbirine değdirmek suretiyle büyük yangın dedi gerçi bir meslektaşımız, iki adet çok büyük yangın dedi. Diyarbakır çok büyük yangın gördü sayın başkan. Gerçek yangın gördü, evler yıkıldı, köyler boşaltıldı, insanlar öldü, perişan oldular. TEDAŞ’ın bakım ve iletim hatlarının eski olduğu, güncellenmeye genleşmeye ihtiyaç olduğu, güçlendirme faaliyetinin yeterince yerine getirilmediği bilinen bir şey bölgede yine keza bölgede özellikle tarımsal sulamanın çok yoğun olması, GAP projesi içinde olması yüzünden, bu arada başka bir şey aklınıza, gelmesin bundan kaynaklı da mevcut sistemin yetmediği aşırı yüklemenin söz konusu olduğu bilinen bir şey zaten bilinen bölgemizde ne yazık ki yaygın affet sebebine dahi düşünebiliyor. Zaman zaman köyde meydana gelen yangınların niteliğini kolluk tespit etmiş, büyük yangın tabir edilecek yangınlar değil. Bunlar bu yangınların kolluğun arama tarama faaliyetlerini önleme yönünü değiştirme, yani bir günah Narin’in naaşının bulunmasını erteleme veya engelleme olarak değerlendirildiği bu şekilde kabul gördüğü en azından, iddia makamı tarafından anlaşılıyor. Biz bu tanımlamayı da kabul etmiyoruz. Tanımlamayı kabul etmemiz mümkün değil. Yine Enes ile ilgili de bu bab altında bir somut isnat da yok, nitekim dolayısıyla burada iddia edilen ve bu şekilde sonuçlandığı değerlendirilen eylemlere de Enes’in iştirak etmediğini ifade etmekle iktifa ediyoruz, jandarmayı dinlemek ve terlik meselesi çok konuşuldu. O husus ile Enes arasında yine illiyet bağı yok, bu yönlü sayın iddia makamının bir isnat da yok. Enes’i doğrudan ilintilendiren dolaylı faillikten gidilecekse eğer tabi yani dolayla failsin. Aynı zamanda yani aslında X şahsı bunu organize etti. Sen de X şahsın bu organize eylemine iştirak ettin. Yönlü arık onu biz düşünmeyeceğiz. Öyle bir isnat yok çünkü terlik olayının sayın iddia makamı tarafından tanımlanma şeklini de biz kabul etmiyoruz. Bu arada onu da kabul etmiyoruz. Bize göre böylesi bir vakada sosyolojik tespit çok önemli olurdu. Yani biz kayıp ailesinin bizim gibi insanlar olduğunu zannedersek, yani bir acıya bir sevince tepki gerektiren bir fiile karşı reflekslerinin bizim gibi olacağını zannedersek yanılmamız çok mümkündür. Farklı davranışlar sergileyebilirler, farklı kültürel ögeleri olabilir, nitekim iki insan bile birbirine benzemez. Topluluklar birbirine hiç benzemezler, daha keskindir kültürel ayrılıkları keşke onlar kendi o dar kültürleri içerisinde değerlendirilseydi. bu durumda o terliği bulup Narin’in olabilir zannıyla …\n\n\nSoruşturmanın Ön Yargılı Seyri ve Mobil Baz İstasyonlarının Gizlenmesi ​\nEvet sayın başkan bu soruşturmanın bütünüyle bir ön yargıya dönüştüğü, çok hızlı bir şekilde ön yargıya dönüştüğü daha sonra devam eden çalışmalar, dökülen tutanaklar, mülakat tutanaklarının içeriği, fezlekeye yansıtılan görüşün kamuoyuna yansıyış biçimi yine yargının soruşturma evresinde gösterdiği refleksler bir bütün halinde değerlendirildiğinde olağan bir ceza yargısı sürecinin işlemediği görülmekte; bu da bu tarz bir etken de delil olarak önümüze konulan materyalleri saatlik bir şekilde incelememizi de dahi etkilemektedir. Nitekim sayın heyet de tespit etti; 21 Ağustos 2024 tarihinde saat 15:08 telefon görüşmesi dışında ayrıca bir WhatsApp görüşmesinin olduğuna ilişkin veri sunuldu. Bu veri çapraz sorguda kullanıldı. Daha sonra bunun yanlış anlaşılma olduğu, ama tabi bu anlaşılmasaydı bir bilirkişi görüşü olarak belki karara etki edecekti. Bu kadar hassas, bu kadar üzerinde ince elenip sık dokunarak bir neticeye varılması gereken bir sorunla karşı karşıyayız. Bu çerçeve ile bu baz çalışmalarına bir küçük örnek vereyim sayın başkan. Bilirkişi bu bölgenin Tavşantepe bölgesine, özellikle Arif’in evinin bulunduğu kısmın yüksek olmasını gerekçe göstererek 22 baz istasyonundan sinyal aldığını iddia ediyor. Bunun da çok daha kaliteli bir veri akışına sebebiyet vereceğini söyler. Taraf vekilleri de bunu savundu zaten. Çok acayip bir yargılama. Bizim açımızdan diğer sanık vekilleri de iddia makamı gibi davranıyor. Bize karşı sadece bizim müvekkil sanık, bizimkiler, yani Güran soyadlı kişiler sanık, diğerlerinin tümü adına kamu adına konuşuyor gibi bir hava hissediyoruz. Bu bir kere her şeyden önce maddi gerçeğe aykırı. Başka sanık da mevcut. Bu dosya kapsamında sadece Güran ailesi mensupları yargılanmıyor. Arama tarama faaliyetleri esnasında bu Tavşantepe köyü bir çok noktasında iletişimin sıkıntılı olduğu fark edilince, tespit edilince bu sıkıntıyı gidermek amacıyla buraya mobil baz istasyonları getirtilir, bunlar oraya bölge bölge konuşlandırılır. Bu mobil istasyonlardan bir tanesi de Arif’in evinin arkasına bakan tarlasındaydı. Bir tarlanın, bahçenin hemen arkasına konuşlandırılır. Nitekim o bölge de veri trafiğinde sıkıntı yaşatan bölgelerden bir tanesidir. Bilirkişinin mobil bazlardan söz etmesi gerekirdi.\n\n\nBilirkişi Raporunun Taraflılığı ve Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın Korunması ​\nBunlardan bahsetmesi gerekirdi çünkü 29 ve 30 Ağustos’taki birinci periyot çalışmalarında o mobil baz istasyonları hala aktif, faal çalışıyorlar. Naaş bulunmamış, her şeyden önce yani AFAD dahil sahada büyük bir emekle arama tarama faaliyetleri çalıştıran insanların iletişim ihtiyacı devam ediyor. Görüşme trafiğinin sağlıklı devam etmesi gerekiyor. Biz yaptığımız araştırmada istasyonların kurulu olduğu esnada bu çalışmanın yapıldığını, bunun dahi yazılmadığını, bunun yok göründüğünü, yok sayıldığını gördük. Bu kötü bir iki yüzlülük, kötücül bir iki yüzlülüktür çünkü iyi olduğunu göstermek için tırnak içinde Arif’in evinin üstü, Arif’in evinin bulunduğu tepenin üstündeki diğer görevlilerin cep telefonlarının sinyal karışıklığına mahal vermemek amacıyla kapattırdığını yazıyor. Aynı bilirkişi yani 4-5 cep telefonu kapatacak kadar hassas, bu kadar insan hakkına insan geleceğine saygılı ama koca mobil istasyonu yokmuş gibi, yani bilmesek mobil istasyonu yok gibi bunu bize yutturacaklar, bu kötücülüktür. Bu rapor da onun sirayetidir. Nitekim bu raporun nedeni, bu raporun oluşturulma nedeni ön yargıdır. Bir ön yargının, dikkat edersiniz senaryo demiyorum, senaryo bambaşka bir şey, bunun gerçek olduğunu anlatırsınız, deliller ile birlikte ortaya koyarsınız, nitekim yüzde yüze kadar da gerçek çıkabilir, bir kısmı da gerçek çıkabilir. Zaten senaryo da budur. Ama bir ön yargının esiri iseniz, peşin peşin maktüleyi Güran ailesinin fertleri öldürdü, Nevzat Bahtiyar gariban bir insandır, zavallıdır derseniz, Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın aile üyeleri ile Güran ailesinin kadın üyelerinin aynı kategorik suçu işlediği iddialarına yönelik tespitler apaçık ortadayken onun ailesinin üyelerine devlet imkanları ile koruma sağlarsanız, onun aile üyeleri tanık olarak ellerini kollarını sallayarak geldikleri bu mekanda ifade verirken bıyık altından gülerek taraflara bakıp bana zaten bir şey yapamazsınız, ben zaten buraya gelip istediğimi söyleyip istemediğim soruya cevap vermeyerek elimi kolumu sallayarak bu kapıdan çıkıp gideceğim psikolojisi ile hareket ederse, elbette Nevzat Bahtiyar rahat olur, dokuzuncu senaryo ile de karşınıza gelir. Yalanın tanımını yapalım öyleyse. Yalan nedir? Dil çok önemli. Dil oldukça önemli.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Çelişkili Beyanları ve Motivasyonları ​\nHem iletişim aracımız hem nesnelere isim koyma, yani onlar üzerinde hakimiyet kurmamızı sağlama aracı. Bütün düşünce biçiminde dile çok yüksek bir değer verilir. Nevzat Bahtiyar yalan mı söylüyor? Birinden ya da birilerinden korktuğu için gerçeğin bir kısmını size ikrar edip, gelişen süre içerisinde açıla açıla, onların tabiri olduğu için kullandım. Derler ki, Nevzat Bahtiyar her ifadesinde gerçeği biraz daha apaçık önümüze sererek aslında yargılamaya hizmet eder, yani nedamet getirir derler. Etkin pişmanlık duyan bir faildir, derler. Nevzat Bahtiyar gerçeği parça parça bizden uzaklaştırmakta, her tutumu ile her beyanı ile bizden biraz daha uzaklaştırıyor. Amacının ne olduğunu ben de tahmin edemiyorum, ben de algılayamıyorum ama anlattığının hakikat olmadığı çok açıktır, Neden yalan bir ihtiyaç halinde söylenir? Yalan bir savunma aracıdır. Kaba güçle, para gücüyle, kudretle, zekayla alaşağı edemeyeceğiniz, size yönelen, size ve yakınlarınıza tıpkı yasada tarif edildiği gibi mücbir sebep gibi size ve yakınlarınıza yönelen bir tehlikeyi geçici bir süre için bertaraf etme yöntemidir. Yalan bir savunma refleksidir, canlılığı gösterir. Kişi ihtiyacı olduğu için yalan söyler. Ama Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın neden böyle bir ihtiyacı olsun? Nevzat Bahtiyar bir ifadesinde köyün alt kısmındaki ağaçların olduğu alanda naaşı teslim aldım derken neden bir başka ifadesinde Enes’in içeride uyuduğunu bildiği halde evden aldığını, neden bir başka bir ifadesinde ahırın üzerinde burada ahırın üstünde aldığını da inkar etti? Ya ben ona çok şaşırdım. Yani ahırın üstündeki açıklık pencere dedikleri aslında pencere değil, çatıda açılmış bir açıklık. Oradan bıraktığını, kendisinin alttaki atık tahliyesi için kullandığı kapı diye tabir ettiği yerden girdiğini belirtmişti. Hatta demişti ki, insancıl görünmek için ben yavaş bıraktım demişti. Ben yavaşta bırakmıştım demişti, yukarıdan yavaşça. Neden bunu söyleme ihtiyacı duysun? Bir sanık böyle bir yalandan nasıl bir menfaat elde edebilir ki? Bunun ona yararı ne olabilir? Nevzat Bahtiyar kafa karıştırırsa faydası çoktur ama kendisiyle faydası inanılmazdır. Para ile satın alamaz.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Olası Amacı ve Kolluk Kaynaklı Hatalar ​\nŞayet kafa karıştırır, kendisinin beyanlarının Güran ailesinin huzurda tutuklu diğer sanıkların mahkumiyetine yeter nitelikte delil olarak en azından bu delillerin önemli bir kısmı olarak görülmesini sağlarsa ileri aşamada kendisi büyük ihtimal ile ya yardım eden sıfatına haiz olacaktır. Beklentisi anlamında söylüyorum ya da hayali olan delilleri karartan fail olarak değerlendirilecektir. Bu amaçla kafa karıştırmaktadır. Eğer iddia ettiği gibi Salim’den korktuğu için, bundan dolayı çelişen beyanlarda bulunmuş olsaydı, ilk beyanında Salim’i söylemezdi. Alışık olduğumuz üzere Salim’in apaçık kimliğini belirtmez ama Salim’i ileride söylemesine izin verecek açıklıkta bir kişiden bahseder sonra gelişen evre ve aşamalarda benim o tarihte bahsettiğim kişi huzurdaki sanık Salim’dir derdi. Biz de inanırdık. Heyet de “evet olabilir” derdi. Böyle bir şey yok. Salim’i zaten söylüyorsun, başta söylemezsin, peşin peşin söylemezsin, kolluktan da çok yararlanmışsın, bayağı yararlanmışsın. O kolluk ki, biz ilk defa dedikodu diye bir şey duyduk ya. Ceza yargılaması dedikodu bir bilgi kaynağı olabilir mi? Biz istihbari çalışma diye bir bilgi kaynağının olduğunu biliyorduk. Ceza yargılamalarına sirayet ediyordu. Nasıl elde edildiği ne şekilde değerlendirildiği evrakla izah edilmeyen istihbari bilgi bunlar mevcut başka yargılamalarda ama köyde mahallede yapılan çalışmalardaki duyumlar, dedikodular deyip ondan sonra kadın sanığın kayın biradelerinden ismi tespit edilemeyen biri ile münasebetti denilip bu da bu tespit vesikası da CMK 135’e göre olağanüstü güvenlik tedbirlerinden olan iletişimin tespiti talebine dayanak olarak gösterilirse Nevzat Bahtiyar bunu tabii ki duyacak. Nevzat Bahtiyar sürekli Arif’in yanında namaz kılmadı herhalde. Kendisinin iddia ettiği gibi fırsatını bulup “Fırsatını bulsaydım ben naaşı oradan çıkaracaktım, bir kara yolunun bir yerine bir kara yolunun kenarına bırakıp ailesine ulaşmasını sağlayacaktım”. Burada da duygulara hitap ediyor. Bir mezarı olsun diye bir kavram vardır. Bari bir mezarı olsun, umutsuzluğa kapılan anne babaların sözüdür, kayıp yakınlarının sözüdür. Bari benim oğlumun, benim kızımın, kardeşimin bari bir mezarı olsun. O duyguya sesleniyor.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Fail Olma İhtimali ve Ailesinin Tutumu ​\nYani biz gelinen aşamada büyük oranda bu işin failinin kendisi olmasının çok kuvvetli bir ihtimali olduğu noktasına geldik. Kanaat olarak bu anlamda diğer sanıkları da provoke ediyor. Sayın mahkemeye etki etmeye çalışıyor. Bir sanık olarak yalan söyleme hakkı var, buna bir diyeceğimiz yok, bir itirazımız yok ama yalanı kendisiyle ilgili değil. Yalanı başkalarının güvenliğini tehlikeleye düşürecek, onların hürriyet hakkına müdahale, yasal müdahale ile sonuçlanacak niteliktedir. Çok tehlikeli bir mekanizmayı işletiyor ve destek görüyor. Yasal olarak kendi ağzı ile itiraf etti. Dedi ki, benim ailem güvende olduktan sonra bu kişinin aile bireylerinin bu kişinin işlediği fiilden haberdar olmamaları mümkün değil. İmkanı yok. Haberdar değiller ise 21 Ağustos 2024 tarihindeki gün içindeki hareketliliğini neden gizleme ihtiyacı duysunlar? Nevzat evre ve aşamalarda bu hususta iddia ettiği üzere kendisi dışında hiçbir canlıya sırrını paylaşmadıysa, karısı Gazal neden onun o gün köyde bulunmadığını söyleme ihtiyacı duysun? Kardeşi Mehmet neden bu ihtiyacı duysun? Oğlu Ferhat neden bu ihtiyacı duysun? Öyle ki, gece 09 Eylül 2024 tarihinde gece üçte alınan bu yollu beyanlar, Mehmet hariç, onun daha sonra alınır, bu yollu beyanlar ertesi sabah 11’de ek bilgi alma tutanağı şablonu ile düzeltilmekte. Neden? Çünkü gece beyanı alındı, kurgu çatısı tamamlandı. Aile üyelerinin de artık bu yeni kurguya göre yeniden modifiye olmaları gerekir, akıl bunu gerektirir. Ne yazık ki, kolluk adli kolluk kısmı ile ilgili görevini düzgün yerine getirememiştir, sonuç budur. Bunu itiraf etmekten de çekinmemek lazım. Bu kendilerini tahkir amaçlı değildir. İllaki iyi niyetle çalışmışlardır. Başka bir amaçları neden olsun? Bu sanıkların hiçbiri ile husumetlerinin olduğundan bahsedemeyiz. Böyle bir delilimiz de yoktur. Olay bütün topluma sirayet etmiştir. Kuvvetle muhtemel buradaki aktörler de bir insandır, evlat sahibidirler. İnsan aklına sahiptirler. Böyle algıladılar.\n\n\nKolluk Çalışmalarındaki Ön Yargı ve Sosyolojik Etiketleme ​\nAile ile irtibata geçtikten sonra aile üyeleri ile irtibata geçtikten sonra böyle hissettiler ki öğretide bilindiği üzere kayıp çocuk vakalarında, evet, çocuk aranır, kayıp olduğu değerlendirilir ama hemen hemen beyin bir tık arkasında da bunun aile üyeleri tarafından zarara uğratılmış olduğu olasılığına da sırt çevrilmez. Bu olasılık da gözetilir. Muhtemelen onlar da öyle düşündüler. Aile üyeleriyle girdikleri temasta aile üyelerinin davranış şekilleri de kendilerine garip geldi sanırım. Sosyolojik etiketlemeyi de ben bu yüzden söyledim. Buna dikkat edilmesi soruşturmaları daha sıhhatli bir noktaya götürebilir dedim ve artık bu amaçla çalıştılar. Bunu aradı, gözleri bunu aradı. Ailenin garipliklerini aradılar, o yüzden terlik onlara garip geldi. Şunu düşündüler, biz burada bir saat önce, biz iki saat önce arama tarama faaliyeti yaptık, biz nasıl bulamıyoruz da bu çocuk gidip getirir? Ha bu kesin aldı, götürdü. Başka bir amacı var. Çocuğu bunlar kaybettirdi. Muhtar kendi yanlarında gezinirken elbette sorular sormuşuz sayın başkanım. Bütün köylü soru sorar, bu arada soru sormalar ile demişler ki, jandarmayı dinleme ya 21 Ağustos 2024 tarihinde saat 20:43’deki ilk ihbardan sonra gerçekten Tavşantepe köyünde Narin’i arayan merak eden hiç kimse yok mu? zannediliyor. Bu çocuğu seven kimse yok mudur? Bu çocuğun başına ne geldiğini merak eden kimse olmayacak mı? Onu soran biri jandarmayı dinliyor mu olacak yani? Ne yaptınız komutanım, ne durumdayız diye soran birinden doğal ne olabilir? Anlaşıldığı kadarıyla bu niyetle yanlarına yaklaşan aile üyelerinden kendilerinden istihbari bilgiyi edinip bu bilgiyi tahmin edilen faillere taşıyıp o tahmin edilen failinde soruşturmayı farklı yönlendireceğinden endişelenen kolluk, bunu alışık olduğu üzere seri tutanaklara bağlamıştır. Emniyet teşkilatı bunu yapmazdı. Çalışma metotları farklıdır. Evrakı bozmazlar. Çok fazla evrak, basit bir gerçeği gözden kaçırma tehlikesi yaratır, yarattı. Şu an da yaratmış vaziyette bir de şu tutanakların bağlayıcılığını konuşmamız gerekiyor sanırım. Burada bazı meslektaşlarımı dinledim. Üzüntü ile dinledim. Ne zamandan beri bir hukukçu bir kolluk görevlisinin tutmuş olduğu tutanağı kesin bir belge içeriyormuş gibi davrandı?\n\n\nKolluk Tutanaklarının Bağlayıcılığı ve Telefon Kaydı İddiaları ​\nTırnak içinde o tutanak kesin bir veriyi de içerebilir, bu mümkündür; mümkündür ama ne zamandan beri tüm tutanaklar için geçerlidir? Yazıldıysa, üstünde tutanak yazıyorsa, altında kolluk imzası var ise artık tartışılmaz bakış açısı olabilir mi? Bir hukuk için böyle bir şey olabilir mi? Eğer bu düsturla hareket edilseydi, bugün burada 200’e yakın müşterek failimiz olacaktı. Hepsini de yargılayacaktınız çünkü kolluk tutanaklarına hakim olan görüş iddianame ve esas hakkında mütalaya da sirayet etmek durumunda kalınmış, orada neredeyse şimdi dil çok önemli dedik ya, neredeyse kelimesinin anlamı belli bütünü kapsamaz değil, bütünün yaklaşık tamama yakını anlamına gelir. Dolayısıyla %50 üstünü kastediyorsanız ise kullanabileceğiniz bir kelimedir. Neredeyse aile üyelerinin, neredeyse bütününün telefon kayıtlarını sildiği, doğru bir bilgi değil. Bu doğru bir bilgi değil sayın başkan. Şurada oransal olarak baksak sadece huzurunuzdaki bu dört sanık için bile oransal baksak, dört sanığın dörtte üçü aile üyesi, dörtte biri yabancı şahıs. Enes telefonundan hiçbir veriyi silmemiş, Yüksel telefonundan hiçbir veriyi silmemiş. Neden çalışmıyor senin formülün? Geniş soruşturma kapsamında baktığımız zaman sayı altıdır. Altıyı geçemeyeceksiniz. aile dokuz kişiden mi oluşuyor ki nerede tamamının telefon verilerini sildiği ibaresini kullanacaksınız? Bunlar hukuki metinler. Bu metinler ile bir insanın çok ağır bir hürriyeti bağlayıcı hapis cezasına çarptırılmasını, kamu adına talep ediyorsunuz. Öyleyse kelimelerin seçimine de dikkat edilmesi gerekiyor. lafız bu yüzden çok önemli sayın başkan. Enes’e, savunmamızın geneline hakim olduğu üzere, Enes’e isnat edilen eyleme iştirak şekli açıklanmadığı için bunu bizim açıklamamız bekleniyor veya sayın heyetin keşfetmesi bekleniyor.\n\n\nUKB’nin Ehliyetsizliği ve Bilimsel Yaklaşım Talebi ​\nBiz tahmin edilen, tahmin edilen eyleme ve suç işleme kararına iştirak ettiğini gösterir, ceza muhakemesi kanununda nitelikleri tek tek hassasiyetle sayılmış, her türlü şüpheden uzak hukuka aykırı elde edilmemiş, hüküm tesisine elverişli gerekçeli karar hakkının yansıması olan gerekçeli kararlar yazmaya ehil delillerin müvekkil yönünden aleyhe, bu bağlamda dar baz daraltılmaz baz çalışması olduğunu, bu deliller sayın mahkemenin, bize göre tabi bizim değerlendirmemizdir, bu sayın mahkemenin bu rapor olarak en azından ek raporu sayın mahkeme tanzim ettiği için buradaki görüşü ciddiye aldığını gösterir bir görüş olarak kabul etmiştir. Ek rapor içeriği ile yetinerek karar aşamasında bunun maddi delil olup olmadığı, hükme esas alınıp alınamayacağı tartışmalarında destekleyici olması açısından biz keşke bizim talebimiz buydu, düşüncemiz de buydu. Bu konuda ehil teknik ekipman ve insan gücüne, beyin gücüne sahip nice Üniversitelerimiz var. Buralarda bu iddiayı mümkün mü değil mi yönünden irdeleyebilecek bizim anlayacağımız şekilde gösterebilecek ve eğer mümkünse bunun sınırlarını sapma payını dayanması gereken bilimsel kriterleri uygulama alanını rapora döndürebilecek, kalifiye uzman kişiler mevcuttu. Nitekim yasa da imkan sunar, der ki, senin yargı alanındaki bilirkişi listesinde aradığın niteliğe haiz bilirkişi yoksa sen başka yer listelerinden de bu kişiyi temin edebilirsin. Baktın ki o listelerde de bulamazsan, o halde liste dışı da olsa yemin verdirme kaydıyla ehil olduğuna inandığın kişiyi, gerçek kişi olması şarttır. Kurum getiremezsin. Kişiyi bilirkişi tayin edersin, yeminini ettirirsin. Artık kamu görevlisidir. O anda UKB Ulusal Kriminal Büro bu manada bilirkişi midir, bilirkişi olarak kabul edilebilir mi? İki fırsatı oldu bu anılan şirketin. İki fırsatı oldu, ikisini de heba etti. Her iki fırsatta aleyhe reklam oldu. En azından biz öyle yapacağız. Bu şirket amacını aşmıştır. Taraf gibi davranmıştır. Bilirkişi her şeyden önce tarafsız olmalı. O kadar ki, bilirkişiyi bile reddedebiliyorsun. Bilirkişi reddi diye bir kurum var. Reddedebiliyorsun. Hakim reddi, biliyorsunuz sayın, başkan hakimleri reddedebiliyoruz. Bilirkişiyi de reddedebiliyoruz. O kadar önemli bir kurum, o kadar tarafsız olması gerekiyor.\n\n\nUKB’nin İhmalleri ve Enes Güran’ın Yaraları Üzerine Yorumlar ​\nSosyal medyada evinde oturan hanımefendilerin DARAN-2 kamera çözümlerinde bulabildiği kayda değer verileri bulamamıştır bu UKB isimli şirket. Yine bir çözümleme sunuldu. Kendilerine bir görüntü kamera görüntüsü kendilerine sunuldu. Çoban olayı şeklinde isimlendirilen vakaya ilişkin toplantı olarak adlandırılan görüşme ses verileri sunuldu. Bunların Türkçe dilindekini anlaşılır hale getirin, başka dildekini kürtçe dilindekini de Türkçeye, özüne sadık kalarak, çevirin denildi. Keşke jandarmaya gönderilseydi. Jandarma teşkilatı, yemin ediyorum, daha güzel tape yapar, yani en azından kimin kimin ile konuştuğunu anlarsın. Yani kimdir, birinci insan, ikinci insan, üçüncü insan bir kategorizasyon yapar. UKB kategorize bile etmemiş. Kaldı ki, birinci insan ile ikinci insanın görüşmelerini aynı satıra almış, yani imlayı da yok saymış, Kürtçe’yi yanlış çevirmiş, ekseriyetle doğru çevirdiğini de zannına kurban etmiş, savcı kelimesi yok bu arada. Sayın savcım orada savcı kelimesi geçmiyor. Devamındaki anlatım doğru görünüyor ama savcı kelimesini nereden duymuşlar anlayamadık. Dolayısıyla sayın başkanım bilirkişi yeteneğine haiz olmadığı açıkça anlaşılan zikrettiğimiz kurumun bünyesinde çalıştığı anlaşılan gerçek kişilerce oluşturulan mezkur bu iki metin ve deşifre klibi isimli evrakın gerekçeli karar aşmasında hükme esas alınamayacağını düşünüyoruz. Bizi olumlu ya da olumsuz, yanıltacaktır. Yanılgılı bir karara sebebiyet verecektir. Ehil değiller. Ehil bir iş çıkaramadılar. Sayın başkan, ben Enes ile ilgili bir kaç şey daha söyleyip toparlayacağım artık. Enes Güran’ın kolundaki ısırık izi, yüzündeki morartı ve çiziğe benzer tırmalama diye değerlendiren oldu. Üst dişleri ile ısırdı, dedi. Savaş bey, yayınlarda en absürt değerlendirme, bu arada, ne yazık ki emekli cinayet detektifine nasip oldu. Emekli cinayet detektifi, yani bu işi en iyi bilmesi gereken adam, insan dedi ki, “Ben buldum”. Bu dedi, maktule onu dedi, hareketli şekilde ısırmış hareketli dişler. Diş sabit çene kemiğine sabit hareket edemez. Sanırım çenenin hareketini kastetti. Dedi ki, bu hareketli bir ısırıktır. yalnız dedi alt diş kavrama diş izi şey üst kavrama diş izi yok. Bu tek yönden yakalayabildi böyle.\n\n\nYaralanmaların Kökeni ve Sosyolojik Açıklama ​\nŞimdi sayın başkan eğer sizler bir yaranın neyden dolayı meydana geldiğini apaçık bilmezseniz. Ceza muhakemesi kanunu çok güzel bir şey söyler. Hem lafzında hem ruhunda vardır. Der ki, sanığın aksi kanıtlamayan ifadesine itibar edilmesi gerekir. Hatta bu pek çok beraat kararının kısaca nedenidir. Sanık yara berelerinin meydana çıkış şeklini izah etti defalarca. Aksini kanıtlayamıyorsanız, Savaş Kurtbaba’nın durumuna düşersiniz. Mısır koçanı, mısır yaprağı çizer mi, çizmez mi? Aramalar sırasında kapılardan geçerken sırtı çizilebilir mi? Sırtını taş duvara dayarsa izi oluşabilir mi? Yoksa bunlar sivilce izleri mi? Bir insan kendi kolunu bu açıyla bu noktadan ısırabilir mi? Isırırsa oluşacak iz bu şekilde midir? Bir insan kendi kolunu ısırırsa kolu kendini geri çekip onun yüzünü diğer tarafa çekebilir mi? İnsan kolunu ısırabilir, insan istedikten sonra kendine zarar verir. Burada anlaşılmayan sanırım dışlanan etken şuydu; yine sosyolojik vakaya geldik, yine sosyolojik vaka. Evet, empatinin dozunu çok artırırsanız, açıklayacağınız kişi kendiselleştirirsiniz. Yani onu sizin onun bir yansımanız haline getirirsiniz. Siz kendi kolunuzu ısırmazsınız. Bir acı esnasında yani ama Enes ısırıyor, bu bir gerçek. Bu Enes’in kız kardeşini öldürdüğü anlamına mı geliyor? Böyle bir iddianame oluşturmaya kalkarsanız veya bu yönlü sonuçları görünümleri bir insanın kız kardeşini katletmesinin tartışılmaz delilleri gibi göstermeye kalkarsınız, bana göre sonuç beklendiği gibi gerçekleşmeyecektir çünkü sanık açık açık izah etti ve evet sosyolojik bir vaka olarak bizim bölgemizde özellikle kırsal alanlarda dövünme diye bir durum var. Dövünme, bizde insanlar bir acı çektiğinde evet hala dövünüyor. Dövünen insanlar var. Dövünüyorlar, bildiğiniz dövünüyorlar. Bunun hatta bir takım seranomik görünümleri vardır. Mesela kadın saçını örten şeyi çıkarır, o örtüyü çıkarır, yere atar. Bunun bir karşılığı vardır. Üst bacak kısımlarına vuran insanlar vardır. Göğüsünü yumruklayan insanlar vardır. Başını duvardan duvara, yani Fakir Baykurt romanlarında bu unsurlar geçer. Orhan Kemal’de geçer. Bu Anadolu’ya has aslında bir acıyı dışa vurum biçimidir.\n\n\nSanık Beyanlarının Değeri ve Adil Yargılama Talebi ​\nAklımıza şu geliyor, tabi kendimizle özdeşleştirince, kendiselleştirince diyoruz ki, ya bir insan neden kendi yüzünü gözünü yumruklasın ki? Böyle bir şey çok absürt olur. Bunu biri dövdü her halde veya maktule ile boğuştu, o sırada annesi onu engellemeye çalıştı senaryoların sonu gelmez. Sanık apaçık belirtmiştir. Başına gelenleri anlatmıştır. Aslında sanık benim yüzümü aslında mısır koçanı çizdi demiyor. Bu arada benim yüzümü mısır koçanı çizmiş olabilir diyor çünkü yaşadıklarını anlatıyor. Çünkü yaşadıklarını anlatıyor bu yaşadıklarının içerisindeki A olasılığı, B olasılığı, C mekanı ve D benim şu eylemim bu sonuçlara yol açabilir diyor. Tıbben de mümkündür. Sosyolojik olarak da yaşanmaya devam eden bir davranış biçimidir. Öfke, üzüntü, keder dışa vurum biçimidir, bölgeseldir. Sadece bizim toplulukta yok, başka benzer yaşamı olan topluluklarda da mevcuttur ama bunlar bir sanığın fail olduğu anlamına gelmez bir sanığın iddia edilen suçun faili olduğunu kanıtlamaya yetmez yetemez. Maddi deliller bulmanız lazım. Net maddi deliller bulmanız lazım. Sanık Enes müdafi olduğum için sadece onunla sınırlı konuşmak durumundayım. Enes ile ilgili sayın iddia makamının sayın mahkemeye sunduğu deliller bu arada ceza muhakemesi kanununda, biliyorsunuz sayın başkanım, re’sen soruşturma ilkesi zımnen yok. Zımnen yok. Re’sen soruşturma yok artık. Yani eski kanunla beraber terk edildi fakat uygulamada hala var iyi ki de var yoksa iddianamede gösterilen eylem ve deliller ile sınırlı kalırdık. Bizim sunduklarımız iddia makamının sunduklarını sizler Amerikan yargısındaki gibi nitelendirme ve buna karşılık cezayı belirleme ile sınırlı kalırdınız. Re’sen soruşturdunuz, teşekkür ediyoruz. En azından, bu kısa, görece kısa zaman içerisinde yapabildiğiniz kadar derinleştirdiniz, çabalarınıza emeklerinize saygı duyuyoruz. Hakikaten ama eğer siyasal irade, toplumsal baskı, psikolojik etken, acıma hisleri, ön yargılar gibi biz insanlara mahsus, biz insanların birey ve toplum içindeki görünümleri etkilerse kararı bu çok korkunç olur. Biz sayın heyetten eminiz. Duygusuz bir şekilde, duygusuz bir şekilde ama adil bir şekilde kararını verecektir. Sanık Enes haksız ve hukuka aykırı bir şekilde cezaevinde tutulmaktadır.\n\n\nYargılamanın Sonucu ve Enes Güran İçin Beraat Talebi ​\nBu gerçeği mevcut dosyaya sunduğunuz hiçbir delil veya delil görünümlü evrak değiştirmez. Son teknoloji diye açıklanan imkanlarımızı da dünya alem gördü. Buymuş, son teknolojik imkanlarımız da buymuş. Orta doğu tarzı teknoloji. Zararın neresinden dönülse kardır, hatanın neresinde, hata ikrar edilirse kişi kazanır. Hata insana mahsustur. Zan insani bir ögedir. Zannettik hepimiz birlikte ama nihai kararı ne Türkiye toplumu verecektir, ne basın verecektir, ne evlerinde çocukların başında güvenle, iyi ki de güvenle bekleyen anneler babalar verecektir. Sayın heyet verecektir. Biz bu sebeple müvekkil sanık tutuklu sanık Enes Güran hakkında saydığımız nedenler beraat verilmesini, kararla birlikte doğal olarak tutuklama tedbirine son verilmesini, şayet sayın mahkeme aksi kanaatte ise tevziye söz konusu olacaksa bu durumda da en azında görünüşte adaletin sağlama fırsatını teminen salt hükmedilecek hapis cezasının infaz rejimi veya alt ve üst sınırı gözetilmek suretiyle tutukluğun devamı gibi bir hüküm ile birlikte karara tevessül edilmemesini, yargılama sürecenin, soruşturma sürecinin kamuoyuna da insanların zihnine de kalbine de hala bağımsız düşünmeyi başaran hala bir olaya ruhsuz bakan ruhsuz bakabilen hukukçuların da bu davayı gözetlediği, gözetlemeye de devam edeceğinin bilinciyle en azından soruşturma aşamasında hukuk bulamayan, adalet bulamayan müvekkilimin olağan yargı yollarında evinde hapis, adli kontrol tedbiri ile ev hapsi, şayet eğer tevziye kararı verirseniz bir dengeleme yapılmasını talep ediyoruz, saygılarımızı sunuyoruz.",

    "section": "Av. Mustafa DEMİR ​",
    "text": "Av. Mustafa DEMİR ​\n\nAvukatın Baro ile İlişkisi ve Hukuka Aykırı Deliller ​\nŞimdi öncelikle biz de Diyarbakır Barosu’nun burada olmasını diğer meslektaşlarımın burada olmasını gerçekten istedik, hatta ilk başta bunu düşündüğümüzde bu yargılamayı tıkar mı acaba, bir sıkıntı mı olur diye düşündük. Evet bizim bir lütfumuz değil, bu kararı biz vermedik. Mahkeme takdir etti, mahkeme verdi. Ancak biz de burada esnek davranılması gerektiğini talep ettik mahkemeden. Bunun sebebi de şuydu. Biz hukukçuların hukuka sahip çıkacağını düşündük. En azından gördükleri bir hukuksuzluğa müdahale edeceğini, bunun hukuksuz olduğunu dile getireceğini düşündük. Ne yazık ki kısmen böyle olmadı. İsim vereceğim ama hedef göstermek için değil, bunu sakın yanlış anlamayın. Nahit bey, kendisi dedi ki; evet bu cezaevi görüşmelerinin dosya içerisine girmesi hukuka aykırı delil ama dosya içerisinde ise ben sorarım dedi. Yani hukuka aykırı bir delilin benim için nasıl elde edildiği önemli değil, dosya içerisinde ise ben sorarım dedi. Biz bunların olmayacağını ön görerek avukat meslektaşlarımızın bulunmasının dosya açısından faydalı olacağını düşündük ancak gelinen süreçte bunun böyle olmadığını gördük.\n\n\nÇoban Ahmet Meselesi ve Kamera Kayıtları ​\nYine başka konularda, yine kendisinin izah ettiği üzere bu çoban Ahmet meselesi, gerçi başkanım size de izah ettim, çoban meselesi hangi gün çıktı? Tam olarak DARAN-360 derece dönen kameralarının kayıt almadığı günün yazısının geldiği gün. Ne tesadüftür ki. Büyük bir ihmal var, çok büyük bir ihmal. Bu aynı gün bu çobanın videosu çıkıp DARAN-360 dönen kameralarının neden alınmadığı ile ilgili gündem oluşmadı. Tam aksine bu konu konuşuldu. Sadece işte, Ramazan Atasoy alınmış, Ramazan Atasoy’u sorguya çekmişler. Haberler böyle yapıldı, sonra çobana ulaşıldı. Hatta burada olan bazı gazetecilere beni gidin çobandır, dedim sorun, kendisine ulaşın. Biz hiç yani bilmiyoruz ama hatta ifade değişiklikleri ile ilgili orada güzel bir şey. Erhan Güran’a ben orada sordum sen bu çoban meselesini hiçbir yerde anlattın mı? Anlamadığı için “hayır” dedi. Halbuki anlatmıştı. Çıktığı bir TV kanalında daha bu video çıkmadan kameraların altında sorguladığı yani kendi evinin önünde çobandan, tavırlarından şüphelenip sorguladığını anlatmıştı. Yani bilinmeyen, gizlenen bir husus değildi. Nitekim siz de duruşma zaptında kaçırmışsınız. Ben size sorduğumda yok dediniz, halbuki burada da anlattı, gizlemedi. Gerçekten bakın, biz bu dosyaya dahil olduktan sonra sürekli biz de sorular sorduk müvekkillere. Hepsine tamamına bir tane yalan söylemediler bize. Ne sorduksa gerçekten şeffaf bir şekilde söylediler ve ilerleyen aşamalarda hep doğruyu söylediklerini gördük. Bu konu da öyledir. Yani nasıl bakılmak isteniyorsa geçen celse Fatih arkadaşım söyledi, ne görmek istendi ise öyle bakıldı. Onun için hep o görüldü. Bunun şimdi ilerleyen aşamalarda hep anlattıkça destekleyeceğim. Ne yazık ki, Diyarbakır Barosu demeyeyim de Nahit bey de hep bu şekilde bakmak istediği için bu şekilde gördü. Ama tabii ki kendisi şeye gitmedi, yan yollara gitmedi.\n\n\nDiyarbakır Barosu’nun Katkıları ve Şeffaflık ​\nGerçekten iyi niyeti ile yaptığını biliyorum. Örnek veriyorum, Ulusal Kriminal bir rapor yayınladı. Oradaki çevirinin doğru olmadığını bildiği için hiç kullanmadı. Sonra WhatsApp araması ile ilgili hususu anlattığımız gibi kayma olduğunu anlattığımız gibi kendileri de kontrol etti, kullanmadı. Aslında gördüğünü inkar etmiyor. Bunu kabul ediyorum, yani katkısı oldu. Bu açıdan yine Ulusal Kriminal’in görüntüler ile ilgili traktör oturup zaman ayırmış. Gerçekten ciddi çalışmış Diyarbakır Barosu bu dosyaya. Onun için emeklerine saygı duyuyorum. Bunun zorunda değillerdi. Çocuklarından, mesailerinden zaman ayırıp bu dosyaya çalışmışlar. Bu saygı duyulacak bir şey. Biz de saygı duyuyoruz. Yanlış anlaşılmasın. Eğer gecenin geç saatinde ettiğimiz bir ters laf varsa bunun için de özür dileriz, özür dilemeyi de biliriz. Ama karşılıklı. Mesela siz de beni kıran laflar ettiniz. Ben de yine aynı şekilde geç saatlere kadar kaldım. Mesela ben şeker hastasıyım. İster istemez ağzımdan kırıcı laflar çıkabilir geç saatlerde. Hatta bir arkadaşımız, Behlül bey beni uyardı. Ağabey sen bağırıyorsun. Baktım hakikaten haklısın dedim. Özür dilerim dedim. Yani farkında olmadan olabiliyor ama amaç sonuca götürmeli. Bakın Fatih arkadaşımız şunu anlatmaya çalıştı.\n\n\n“Herhaldeler İddianamesi” ve Tutanakların Güvenilirliği ​\nBurada bir anomali var. Gerçekten çok sıra dışı bir dosya bu. Öyle sıra dışı olduğu için şu anda da böyle devam ediyor. Bir anneyi kendi evladını öldürmekle suçluyoruz. Bir ağabeyi yine aynı şekilde. Yani ilk temel bakmamız gereken iki şey bu. Diyarbakır Barosu’nun kadın hakları merkezi var. Bakın bu dosya nasıl bir dosya? Herhaldeler İddianamesi ile başladı. Ben ona Herhaldeler İddianamesi diyorum çünkü somut, böyle olmuş demiyor. Birçok şeye olsa olsa herhalde böyle oldu bakış açısıyla getirilen yorumlar. İşte tutanaklar. Tutanakları geçen celse bir kısmını anlattık. Mevcut dosyada eğitim eşitsizliğinden dolayı geri kalmış Yüksel hanım Kürtçe düşünüp kendini Türkçe ifade ederken yaşadığı zorlukları, karşı tarafın ruh halini anlamamasından, daha önce engelli bir evlat yetiştirmiş bu evladı kaybetmiş, kendini ifade etmekte ciddi zorlanan bir insanın anlattıklarına kendi kişisel yorumları katılarak tutanaklar tutulmuş ve bu tutanaklar daha da üstüne kelimeler eklenerek iddianame oluşturulmuş. Gördük. Savcı hanım bu kısımları kısmen çıkarsa da hala tutanaklar mütalaanın dayanağını oluşturuyor. Ancak tutanaklar ile bu iş olur mu? Göreceğiz. Bunu söylemek istedim. Yani biz kesinlikle Diyarbakır Barosu’nun duruşuna, kişiliğine söyleyeceksek, evet bu bizim haddimiz değil, biz haddimizi biliriz. Sonrasında savunmaya geçmek istiyorum.\n\n\nDaraltılmış Baz ve Uzman Raporu Eleştirisi ​\nŞimdi bu iddianamenin en büyük telem noktası neydi? Daraltılmış baz. Türkiye’de daha önceden var mıdır yok mudur bakan? Onlarca dosya var. Dün de burada da geçti. Rojin Kabataş’ın olayı hala biliniyor. Orada da yapılabilir. Yine Gülistan Doku var. Yani sadece kayıp kızlar tek değil, bir çok vaka var. Neden bunlarda yapılmıyor, burada bu yapıldı? Çünkü bu dosya çıkmıyordu, elden çıkmayacaktı. Bir şeyler yapılıp ya yani bir vahiy gelecekti ya başka bir şey olacaktı ya sihirli bir değnek değecekti, bir şey olacaktı ve bu dosya çıkacaktı. Bilirkişi ek raporunda diyor ki, ben bu dosyaya hiç temas etmedim. Ya bu dosyaya kimsenin temas etme şansı kalmamıştı ki. Türkiye’de sen bu dosya ile ilgili bir rapor hazırlayacaksın, yani bu dosyaya biz avukat olarak girmeden işte müvekiller geldiğinde zaten bir kısım bizde duymuştuk. Geldiğinde, görüştüğümüzde daha detaylı baktık. Muhtemelen baro başkanımız da daha burada değilmiş ama ben bildiğim kadarıyla yine takip ediyordu. Çünkü baro başkanıydı. O dönem etmesi gerekirdi, herkes takip etti. Diyarbakır 8. Ağır Ceza’dan muhtemelen kendilerine geldiği andan itibaren biliyordur, ediyordur. Daha iddianame gelmeden görmeden bakmıştır, illaki bakılmıştır, bakılmama…\n\n\nBilirkişi Raporlarının Güvenilirliği ve Denetlenebilirliği ​\nDuymama şansı yok. İşte Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın da ismini duymuşsunuzdur. Narin Güran’ın ismini duymuşsunuzdur. Ben bunları anlatıyorum. Oradaki ifadeleri duymuşsunuzdur. Ben bu dosyaya temas etmiyorum deyip bu dosyada rapor hazırlayan kişi doğruyu söylemiyordur. Aklımız ile oynamasın kimse. Yani biz de neyin ne olduğunu biliyoruz. Her şeyi biliyoruz yani. Burada aslında itiraz dediniz ya, yargılama ile ilgili; evet şeffaflığınız ile ilgili duruşmayı götürme, yani çok gerginde geçebilirdi ama gerçekten heyet olarak savcım da bütün gerginliği aldınız. Sağ olun. Yoksa acayip bir birikme vardı. Mesela ilk günler hiç gülemiyordum. Dün ben de gülmeye başladım. Hani insan mesela belki bu da haber olacaktı. Avukatları da gülüyor diye çünkü gülmeler bile bu dosyada konuşulur oldu. Ne yazık ki, herhalde herkesin dünkü ruh haliyle konuşup, işte intihar etmesi beklendi. Ne bileyim, daha farklı şeyler beklendi. Şimdi raporlara gelelim. Raporlar önemli. Bunlar rapor mudur? Ya bunu bütün hukukçular biliyor. Burada rapor diyebileceğimiz hiçbir şey yok. Rapor bir kere denetlenebilir olmalı. Buyursunlar aynı uzmanlık alanında kime söylüyorlarsa götürelim bu raporu, denetleyebiliyorlarsa ben hiçbir şey demeyeceğim. Bu rapor denetlenebilir değil. Bilirkişi raporlarında taşıması gereken ilk unsur budur. Denetlenebilir olması lazım. Aynı uzmanlık alanına sahip bir bilirkişiye götürdüğümüzde, “Bak veriler bu, hadi bakalım, bu doğru mudur, değil midir? Sen denetle. Biz bir şey demiyoruz”. Biz götürdük. Hiçbiri denetleyemedi çünkü “Burada ne yapıldığını anlatmıyor” dedi. Ne yapıldığı anlatılmıyor. Ek rapor istendi. Ek rapor da bir şey anlatmadı. Adam kendi kendini doğruluyor. Ben öyle dikkatli davrandım ki, bana güvenin diyor. Ya bunu sen söylemezsin sen hazırlarsın, gönderirsin. Denetleyecek kişiler der “evet bu güvenilir veriler ile güvenilir bir şekilde elde edilmiş”. Üçgenleme yaptığını söylüyor. Dün söyledim ya telefonlar ile bir şey isteyecektim.\n\n\nÜçgenleme Yöntemi ve Sinyal Gücü Değişkenliği ​\nIphone model telefonlarda, aslında dün tesadüf bu konunun bilişim uzmanı ben bir makalesini sunmuştum. Doktora yapmış bir hocamız vardı, Levent bey. Dün duruşma salonundaydı. Geç olacak diye ben söz almadım çünkü sağlıklı bir şekilde ilerlesin diye. Sayın baro başkanım hala bana kırgın mıdır bilmiyorum Iphone telefonlar ile ilgili. Hem adım sayardan kesinlikle hata vermeyeceğini söyledi. Hem Android’lerde hata olur dedi. Bende o zaman Iphone’lardan söyleyeyim. Şimdi Iphone’lar şeyi veriyor. Sinyal verisini veriyor. “*3001#12345#*” yapıp arama tuşuna basınca ekrana geliyor başkanım. Siz de denersiniz.\n\n\nSinyal Gücü ve Üçgenleme Yönteminin Hataları ​\nŞimdi burada bakarsanız sinyal gücü sürekli değişiyor. Bakma şansınız oldu mu, bilmiyorum. Herkes bakabilir. Şimdi üçgenlemede iki husus önemli. 1- Sinyalin açısı. 2- Sinyal gücü. Madem sinyal gücü yerimizde durduğumuz anda bu dediğimiz gibi, gazeteye kendisi dün bir röportaj da verdiler Levent bey, tesadüfen kendi duruşması için Diyarbakır’daydı, bu duruşmayı da takip etti. Hatta biz belki dedik gelirse söz, kendisine de bu konuda bilgisine başvurabilir. Gerçi mahkemeler savunmaya geçtiği için uzman görüşü alacak mıdır bilmiyorum. Sinyal gücü gördüğünüz gibi sürekli durduğumuz yerde sürekli değişiyor. Üçgenleme de eğer matematiksel bir işlem ise bu denli, yani örnek veriyorum 87’den 93’e çıkıyor, yani ciddi oynama oradaki birim az değil. Sabitken bir de hareketliyken nasıl olur bilmiyorum. Denemek lazım. Burada nokta atışı bu sinyal gücü ile yaptığını söylüyor. Eğer bu matematiksel işlemse bir olasılık hesabıdır çünkü 87’yi de dikkate almalıyız, 93’de dikkate almalıyız. Ben zaten geçen celse bunu anlattım. Sinyal böyle dalga boyutundan gelir. Yani böyle lazerle noktaya temas eden bir şey değil. Radyo frekansıdır. Bunun çok örneklemesini yapabiliriz. Yani en güzel örnekleme suda oluşan dalgalar gibi dalga dalga gibi geliyor. İlk gelen 87 iken işte ardından daha güçlü 93 olabiliyor. Eve uzaklık anlamak için bir göstergedir ama tek başına yeterli değildir. Açı da yine aynı şekilde burada yapılan üçgenlemeler ile burada noktasal bir yer oluşturuyor, evet oranın içerisinde, evet. Nasıl söyleyeyim dün Fatih bey lazer ile ekran da gösterdi ya, yuvarlak daire çizdi. Ne olduysa burada oldu dedi. Evet ne olduysa orada oldu ama bakın oranın içerisinde bakın daha farklı yerler var. Neresi var? İnkar edemeyeceği bir yer. Kendi ahırı.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Ahırı ve Gübre Çuvalı Delili ​\nNevzat Bahtiyar o gün Narin’i kendi ahırına götürdü. Nereden biliyoruz? Somut bir veri var elimizde. Bir gübre çuvalı var. O gübre çuvalının üzerindeki seri numarası ahırında çıkan çuvallarla ardışık. Demek ki, bunu oradan alma ihtimali çok yüksek. Nitekim, kendisi de ilk savcılık ve sorgu ifadesinde ahırına gittiğini söylüyor. Söylemek zorunda kalıyor. Demek aslında birçok şeyi de söylemiyor da zaman içerisinde söylemek zorunda kalıyor. Duruşmada da bir şeyi ağzından kaçırdı.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın İfade Çelişkileri ve Araba Meselesi ​\nBizim arkadaş fark etmedi, belki üstüne gidilse o kaydı izlemenizi isteyeceğim. Bizim Fatih kendisine araba meselesini sorunca onun için değil dedi. Lütfen onu izleyin. Acaba ne içindi? Daha soru gelmeden “Onun için değil” dedi. Acaba ne içindi? Nevzat Bahtiyar ahırından hiç gitmiyor. Yani 15:08’de daraltılmış baza göre anlatıyorum. Maddi gerçekten gidiyorum, bunu kimse tartışamaz çünkü kendisi de söylüyor. Bunu destekleyen bir yan delil var. Çıkan çuval orada. Çıkan çuvalların seri numaraları ardışık. Bu kesin bir şey. Yani tek başına delil değildir. Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın tek örtüşen konusu bu. O da değişti, biliyorsunuz. İlk başta arabadan arabaya dedi, sonra savcılığa gelince arabam ile geri geri gelip ahıra gittim dedi, ahır sonra hep kaldı. Dün aslında Fatih bey çok güzel bir excel tablosu yaptı, bir tablo yaptı. Çok sağlıklı güzel. Onu bunu bir flash disk’in içerisinde sunacağız. Bir incelerseniz anlaşılır.\n\n\nDaraltılmış Baz Raporundaki Tutarsızlıklar ​\nDaraltılmış baza göre 15:08’den sonra Nevzat Bahtiyar evinden çıktıktan sonra ne evine ne de müştemilatına girmiyor. Nasıl oluyor bu? Çünkü dediğim gibi olasılık hesabı. Ben canım böyle istedi böyle yaptım şeyi ile yapılmış rapor buna da güvenmemizi bekliyor. Ben iki mesaj yolladım sadece kendisine. Dedim ki, bak iki kamera var. Kameralar ile uyuşmuyor senin anlatımların. Bir de mısır tarlası değil dedim. Orada pamuk cevap vermiş takip etmiyor ama cevap verebiliyor. Ben mesaj yolladım. Basında da söyledim bunu. Dedi ki, ben dedi, bir dakikalık hani 55 var ya, savunma tarafı da dedi, bir dakikalık hatadan dolayı 55. Ya aklımız ile alay etmeyin. 18:55’te evet Salim Güran okulun önünde görünüyor, 18:56 ya kadar Arif Güran’ın evinin civarında diyor. Ya tam bir dakika ben hata yapabilirim, ya sen bizimle dalga mı geçiyorsun? Salim Güran’ın Arif’in evinin oraya araba ile gelmesi zaten 3-4 dakika. Nasıl bir dakikalık oynama? Dalga geçiyor bizimle. Bizim de ona inanmamızı bekliyor. Şimdi desteklemek için de sunuldu, dendi ki Uzunbahçe tarafındaki tarlayı gösteren Ruhi Kaya’nın kamerası. Buna gerek yok. Buna gerek yok çünkü evet biz bu konunun uzmanı değiliz ancak HTS dökümlerine baktığımız zaman biz de bazı şeyleri anlayabiliriz. İşte mesela nedir, kalktı dediler ki, Uğurcan ile Devran da mı bu işin içerisinde? Ama olmadığını biliyordu. Savcılık nereden biliyordu? Bir PTS’den bir de HTS’den belliydi. HTS’ye bakarsanız dosyada Uğurcan’ın HTS kayıtları var. Uğurcan o gün 16:00’da Çınar’da ben bunu söyleyebilirim. Çınar’da çünkü HTS bazı Çınar görünüyor. Yine Salim Güran’ın da Uzunbahçe tarafına yöneldiğinde otomatikmen HTS bazı değişiyor. Yani üçgenleme yapıyorum zırva. Hiçbir yerde nokta vermiyor. Mesela akşam saatlerinde gördüğü araç ile ilgili bir konum vermiyor. Madem üçgenleme yapıyorsunuz üçgenlemede bir alan verirsin. Koordinat verirsin. Bu koordinatların içerisinde dersin. Demiyor. O görüntüleri izlediler. Biliyorlar bu görüntüleri izlediklerini. Nereden biliyoruz? Nevzat’ın sorgusundan biliyoruz. Nevzat’a sorulan sorudan biliyoruz. Nevzat’a diyorlar ki, Siz 22:00 ile 23:00 arası Salim ile birlikte Narin’in bulunduğu yere gittiniz mi? Bunu niye diyorlar çünkü o görüntüyü izleyip bir delil daha üretelim diyorlar. Ya böyle olmaz gerçekten böyle olmaz. Bir yerde, bakın evet bu ailenin başına çok kötü şeyler geldi ama hukuk herkes için lazım. Yarın aynı şeylerin başka bir yerde başka bir ailenin başına gelme ihtimali var. Eğer biz buna izin verirsek izin vermemeliyiz, hep birlikte izin vermemeliyiz. Bizler hukukçular başta olarak izin vermemeliyiz, unutmamalıyız. Bakın burada verilen karar tarihe geçecek. Bizim burada söylediğimiz sözler, yaptığımız şeyler şu an tarihe bıraktığımız izlerdir. Mahkeme heyeti de dosyanın sonunda vereceği karar ile tarihe bir iz bırakacak. Lütfen hukuka sahip çıkalım. Sadece bunu isteyeceğiz sizden.\n\n\nBilirkişi Uzmanlığı ve CMK Uyarınca Açıklama Talebi ​\nŞimdi bilirkişi o kadar alanında uzman ki, uzmanlığın ne olduğunu yazmamış. Mahkeme dedi ki, bu işte eğitim almış, uzman dedi. Saygı duyacağız. Mahkeme dediyse saygı duyacağız ama dediğimiz gibi uzmanlık şeyleri burada yok. Bilmiyoruz. Bilirkişi listelerinde de değiller. Şunu talep ettik; gelsinler soru soralım bilirkişiye. Biliyorsunuz CMK uyarınca var. Gelir, raporu ile ilgili açıklama isteyebiliriz. Açıklama isteyecektik, sorularımız olacaktı ve ben size söylüyorum o bilirkişiler buraya geldiğinde görecektik. Bakın, unutmayın biz hukukçuyuz. Dediğim gibi hukuka sahip çıkmalıyız. ### HTS ve Dar Bazların ‘Kesin Delil’ İddiası ve Reddi\nDedim ya bir hukukçu, dosyayı bilen bir hukukçu çıktı dedi ki, ilk rapor sonrası ilk duruşma sonrası HTS ve dar bazlar kesin delildir dedi. Çok büyük çok iddialı bir laf. Hata payı sıfırdır dedi. Sonra da dedi ki, ben raporu incelemedim, dedi. Röportajın devamında duruyor. Dedim ya her şey tarihe geçiyor. Onun da vermiş olduğu bu beyanat tarihin şu an sayfalarında duruyor. O da bununla anılacak. Sonrasında ek raporda bilirkişiler ne dedi? Ya dedi ben hata yapabilirim dedi. 2 metre veya 1 dakikalık. ya bir dakika 2 metre 1 dakika kendi içinde ya bak sen bizimle dalga geçiyorsun. Ya bir dakika da bir insan 2 metreden öte bir yol alabilir. Yürüyerek. Aracı söylemiyorum bile. Sen burada bizimle dalga geçiyorsun demek lazım ama demiyoruz. Devam ediyoruz. O hukukçu arkadaşımız da sadece o lafa baksın ve bunu niye bu kadar kısıtlı söyledi, biliyoruz çünkü ne yazık ki bu dosyadaki veriler kesin veri gibi bakanlar da takip ediyordu. Adalet Bakanlığı’na bilgi gitti, oda oda biliyoruz dedi. Adım adım bakan bey de bu veri geliyorsa her halde havadan gelmiyor, kademeden bir yerden geliyor, güvenilir kaynak, her halde teyit edilmiştir. Bakan’a bunu dedikten sonra bilirkişi dönüp ben hata yaptım diyemez. En azından benim raporum varsayıma dayalı da diyemez. Ne yaptı işte dün filmlerden bahsedildiği, ya herkesin bildiği bir Türk filmi var. Ziya diyor ya aslan evladım, dokuz metre ağabeyi kızıyor. Ziya diyor, düşüyor aslanın boyu şimdi bilirkişiler düşürdü. 2 metre 1 dakika. Bir daha belki sorsak bir daha bir şeyler olacaktır ama zaman yok yargılama akıyor gidiyor.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Hareketleri ve Keşif Talebi ​\nKameralardan bahsetmiştik. Tekrara düşmeyelim hem Nevzat’ın Narin’in cansız bedenini götürdüğü yere kamera kayıtlarındaki hareketleri zaman ve mekan yönünden daraltılmış baza uymuyor. Yine daraltılmış baza göre imkansız bir şey vardı. Bunu da dosyaya sunduk. Eğer Nevzat Bahtiyar daraltılmış bazdaki gibi 15:35’de Arif Güran’ın evinde ise ne zaman çıktığını söylemiyor. O zamana kadar orada diyor. Hadi o zaman çıktığını varsayalım. Anlattığı şekilde anlattığı eylemi gerçekleştirmesi mümkün değil. Bunda keşif istedik, yapılmadı. Keşif olamayacak ama işte amatör işte hani işte bu TikTok’çuların keşfi gibi bir şey diyelim.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Ceset Taşıma İfadesinin Çürütülmesi ​\nBir keşif vardı, sağ olsun o Beyaz TV bu işe biraz kendini verdi. Bir canlandırma yaptı. Sunduk orada bir insan taşımıyor, bir yastık taşıyor ama mümkün değil. Gördük, evden bir çocuğu alıp cansız bedeni alıp açık alanda yürüyüp kendi evinin ahırının üstünde ilk başta o da değişti. Önceki gün yan taraftan bıraktığını kayıtlarda duruyor. Üstten diyordu, yandan demiyordu. Üstten attığını söyledi. Hatta Yılmaz bey de buna itiraz etti. Dedi, üstten atılsaydı, ben hatta ses çıkmadı diye sordum. Hatırlıyor. Çok net hatırlıyor. Nahit bey dedi, oluktan attın mı? Evet dedi oluktan. Kayıtlarda aynen bunlar geçiyor. Ben biz bu dosyada belki hatalar yaptık, şey yaptık ama kimse şunu iddia edemez. Ben Nahit beyde de onu görüyorum. Dosyayı kelime kelime, hani kim nerede ne dedi, çok iyi ezberimde. Farkındaysanız, ben duruşmadan da çıkmamaya çok önem gösteriyorum. Yani pür dikkat her şeyi dinliyorum. Kim nerede ne söyledi. Biliyorum, Nahit bey belki sataşma olacak, bu dosyada olmayan şeyleri getirdiniz. Arif bey’in telefon kayıtları silindiği söylendi. Bu dosyada yok. Öyle bir şey yine Osman’ın telefon kırıldı dediniz, bu dosyada böyle bir şey yok.\n\n\nDosyada Olmayan Bilgiler ve Medya Paylaşımları ​\nYani bu dosyada olmayan bir şeyleri kirli bilgileri yayıyorsunuz dediğimde de kızıyorsunuz. Bakın eğer Osman’ın telefon desenini evet hatırlamamış olabilir. Ben sordum aileye “doğrudur” dedi. Telefon kırılmış ama android olduğu için açmışlar hiçbir şey yok. Hiçbir şey olmadığını da söyleyin yine mesela. Twitter’da mitokondriyal DNA ile ilgili bir paylaşım yaptınız, evet gerçekten olanı yazdınız ama nasıl yazdınız? Algıda seçicilik var. Açın, bakın Twitter’ınızı. Narin’in, Anne Yüksel Güran’ın ağabeyi Enes Güran’ın o gün haberlere bakın yine o gün ne vardı biliyor musunuz? Ne tesadüf savcılık size bu bilgiyi veriyor. Savcılık bu dosyadan el çekti. İddianamesini düzenledi, savcılık bu dosyadan el çekti. Bu dosya artık Diyarbakır 8.Ağır Ceza Mahkemesi’nin. Diyarbakır Cumhuriyet Başsavcılığı’nın değil. Bu dosya oradan kendisi kalkıp inceleme yapıp bu dosyaya müdahale edemez. Kanun bir kere buna izin vermiyor. Bunu benden iyi biliyorsunuz. Ardından size dosya değil de size vermesi zaten buna ilişkin bir dilekçe yazdım. Hatta başkana dedim, başkanım biraz sert oldu kusura bakmayın. Ben bundan rahatsız oldum. Ben dosyamdan ilgili bilgileri sosyal medyadan öğreniyorum. İddianameyi öyle öğrendim. Bunu öyle öğrendim. Evet dün bunu da eleştirdiniz. Nahit bey ilk taşı siz attınız, bütün belgeleri bütün açıklamaları sosyal medyadan siz yaptınız, biz değil. Ama biz eleştirildik bundan. Sizin yaptığınız bu durum ile ne yazık ki ilk başta ben şunu söyleyeyim ben sizin kötü niyetli olarak yaptığınızı söylemiyorum. Ben bunun da kötü niyetli olmadığını söylüyorum. Çünkü Nahit bey’in ilk başta yaptığı konuşmalar olmasaydı gerçekten feci şeyler konuşuluyordu. Daha feci şeyler konuşuluyordu. Yalan yanlış konuşulan şeylerin bir kısmını Nahit bey çıktı, düzeltti. Ben bunun böyle olduğunu söylüyorum ama bakın algıda seçicilik diyorum. O mitokondriyal DNA ne zaman oldu? Şahingöz ile kayıt yapılmadığına ilişkin evrak dosyaya geldiğinde bu çıktı. Tesadüfe bakın, savcılık bunu buldu. Bu defa aynı gün şimdi burada şahingöz kayıt yapıyor mu yapmıyor mu? Bize yapıyor dendi. Bir kayıt var. hatta başkanım müsaadeniz ile söyleyebiliyoruz.\n\n\nKamera Kayıtlarındaki İhmaller ve Teknik Arızalar ​\nKayıt almayan bir cihaz. Olayın resmi olarak bildirildiği saat 20:43 olarak geçiyor. Evet, Baran’ın araması bu ama ilk Salim bey 20:18’de jandarmayı aramış. 20:18 alalım, 20:18 iyidir. En erken bu çünkü. Jandarma, peki nasıl oluyor da 18:54’de bakabiliyor? Burada bir ihmal demek, burada anlatılmayan başka bir durum var. Bakın kameralar ile ilgili yaşadığımız tek şey bu değil. Biz duruşma başlamadan yazılı taleplerimiz duruyor. En az altı tane attık. 172G diye bir kamera var. Köyü görüyor. Batıkarakoç tarafında. Onu ısrarla istedik. O da ne hikmetse teknik arıza nedeniyle alınamamış. Aslında gelen tutanakta alınmış dedi ama sonra mahkemeye gelen tutanakta gece yarısı yaşanan fiber kablolarından kaynaklı teknik arıza nedeniyle alınamamış. Ya biz burada demiyoruz illa Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın işte korunmaya çalışıyor. O nedenle mi oldu? Ama bir ihmal var. Evet büyük bir ihmal var. Bu dosyada çok büyük bir ihmal var ve o ihmalin üstü ne yazık ki Güran’lardan çıkarılıyor. Ben bunu görüyorum. Anlatacağım, göreceksiniz. Net yani. Hiç kaçarı olan bir şey değil. Yani bu olay çok basit bir olayken ya biz niye çözemedik? Acaba burada başka bir hata mı var? Bizden kaynaklı bir şey mi var? deyip kendini sorgulayacağına biz çözemedik, çünkü bunlar çok acayip organize bir aile.\n\n\nAilenin İfade Çelişkileri ve Otomatik Banka Ödemesi ​\nOrganize bir aile kendi ifadelerini organize edemiyor. Adam kendi yaptığını bilmiyor. Bakın dün dendi ki, işte Salim Güran kayıt oluşturmaya çalışmış banka dekontu ile. Ya bu adam bunu hatırlamadı ki. Biz de hatta gözden kaçırmıştık. Biz bir ekip oluşturduk kendi içimizde. Sağ olsunlar bu davaya inanan arkadaşlar bize katkı sundular. Biz de dosyaları paylaştık, onunla bir tane Gülcan hanım diye bir bayan bizimle birlikte olan bir arkadaşımız var evraklara birlikte bakıyorduk. Bana dedi ki, burada böyle bir evrak var. Fatura görünüyor. Bu ne? dedi. Bir dakika dedim, biz bunu gözden kaçırmışız. Biz faturayı kendimiz bulmadık yani. Savcılık, evet aleyhe delilleri topladığı gibi, lehe olan delilleri anlatıp yazması gerekir. Mahkemeye ulaştı bu bilgi. Mahkeme sorma gereği duymuyor ama bence önemli. Sorulsun. Telefondan mı otomatik mi? Çünkü otomatik deniyor. Dayanağı da şu diyor; tabi iki ödemeden biri otomatik anlaşıldı dendi. Dayanağı da şu; o saate internet havale görünüyor. İnternet akışı aynı saniye olmasa bile belki gecikmeli düşmüş. Sorulsun yani. Neyse başkası da yapmış olabilir ama bu sorulup araştırılması gereken bir konu. Çok önemli bir konu. ### Adım Sayar Konusu ve Köydeki Şebeke Sorunları\nYine adım sayar konusu da, bakın bizim bulduğumuz bir şey değil. Adam kayıt oluşturuyor kendince ama bunları bilmiyor. Ağırlaştırılmış müebbete gidiyor, akıl etmiyor. Yine biz bulmadık. Bunu görme engelli Diyarbakır’lı bir hemşehrimiz var Müslüm. Müslüm bey bir şekilde bize ulaştı dedi ki, ben sabah evden çıkarken telefonu evde unutmuşum. hemen ekmek almaya çıkmıştım. Geri döndüm, geldim işte sürekli bu dava aklındaymış. Ya diyor düşündüm, oradakilerin birinin adım sayarı var ise? Süper bir şey söylediniz. Zaten anne ile Enes evde olduğu için onların adım sayarından bir şey olmaz da Salim o gün evde olduğunu söylüyor. Darbaza göre sürekli geziyor. Net bir veri. Ya yalan söylüyor ya doğru söylüyor. Çıkaracak bu ortaya. Yani yine bu bizim aklımıza gelen, biz bulalım yapalım dediğimiz bir şey değil. Bakın insanlar gerçekten düşünüyor, sorguluyor. Oturmayan parçalar var. Bakalım ya hepimiz sorgulayalım, akıl sahibiyiz. Geçen celse dedim ya, bir elbise biçildi, dikildi. Elbise olayı oluyor, olmuyor eve elbise olmuyor, başka bir beden arayalım, belki oradadır. Aramadık ama bakın ilk günü bir şeyler söyledik. Bu arada başkanım şeyle ilgili cevap geldi mi? Gezici bazlar ile ilgili gelmedi. Şimdi daraltılmış bazda evet o köy Diyarbakır merkeze yakın ama rapordan da anlayacağınız yine beyanlardan da anlayacağımız ve HTS kayıtlarında anlayacağımız bir kaç şey var. Mesela cami bölgesi. Bir kendimiz de gittik. Hala duruyor gidebiliriz. Köy burada, caminin orada şebeke çekmiyor. Biz Arif bey’in evinin oradayken Arif bey’in evinin duvarında Google’dan işte konuma baktık. Bizi Salim’in evinin içerisinde gösteriyordu. Google’dan da sordum. Ben bilişim uzmanına Google nasıl dedim konumluyor? O da üçgenleme yapıyor dedi. Başka bir şey yapmıyor. Onun yaptığı da üçgenlemeymiş. Yani üçgenleme, bakın böyle Arif bey’in evinin kapısının önündeyken bizi Salim’in evinin içerisinde gösterdi. Şebeke tek çizgiydi, ekran fotoğrafı var. İsterseniz sunabiliriz. Buralarda birazdan onu da sunarım. Tek çizgi şebeke. Yani öyle merkeze yakın acayip şebeke çekiyor, bütün basın burada. Hepsi biliyor. İlk günler orada canlı yayın yapamıyordu. Hala yayın yapmaya gidenler bilir. Orada canlı yayında ciddi problem çünkü şebeke iyi çekmiyor. Olay olduğunda bütün basın orada. Canlı yayın yapanlar biliyor. Şahit olarak gelip söylesinler lütfen. Gezici bazlar bir kaç kare de var. Şimdi ben kare var desem, diyeceksiniz günü ne? haklı olarak. Biz de dedik ki, BTK’ya yazalım. Sağ olun, kabul ettiniz. Hala cevap gelmedi ama karara gidiyoruz. Ya şimdi gezici bazın olduğu bir yerde senin gelip ölçüm yapabilmen ne kadar sağlıklı? Ölçüm-2 ne ile yapmış? Bu adam gelip kendi telefonu ile yapmış. Kendi telefonuna indirdiği yarı amatör bir program ile ölçümleme yapmış. Ben bu telefona bu dosyadan sonra o programı ben de indirdim. NetMonitor diye bir program.\n\n\nYarı Amatör Ölçüm Programı ve Veri Güvenilirliği ​\nAçık bir uygulama. Girersiniz, bakarsınız. Yarı amatör bir program. Şey gibi düşünün. Mesela Google’da haritalar veya yandex navigasyonda bir yere gittiğinizde bazen yol yeni açılmıştır, oraya veri girilmez ya. Bu da onun gibi anlık bilgi vermiyor. Kayıtlı, süreç içerisinde gelen kayıtları tutup onları paylaşıyor çünkü amatör bir program. Şey değil, sunduğu ekran resmi onun resmi. Üçüncü sayfada şuradaki haritaların göründüğü beyaz resim o uygulamaya ait. Diğeri de başka bir uygulama. Dediğim gibi o anlık değil. Kayıtta olan işte burada bu bazlar var, bu bazlar bu güçte veriyor sinyali, bu bölgeye kayıt tutuyor. Bu ne kadar güvenilir? Zaten güvenilmez olduğu için diyorum ya, net. Yine gezici bazlar kendince şöyle bir önlem almış. Biliyordu ne ile geleceğimizi. Her halde tahmin etti. Ben işte orada bulunan personelin sinyal gücünü etkilememesi için telefonunu kapattım. Sen kaç personelin telefonunu kapatabilirsin? Gün gelmiş, 1700 personel duruyor. Hepsi aynı bazdan almak zorunda.\n\n\nBaz İstasyonlarının Veri Saklama Yeteneği ve Güvenilmezliği ​\nBazlar şöyledir. Ben buradayım şu an ofise yakın bir baz var galiba, oraya bağlıyım. Oradaki baza bağlıyım. Bazın bir kapasitesi var. Her bazın öyledir. Gözleri var. Kapasite var, kapasite dolduğunda bazların da petek sistemi ile birbirine bağlantısı var. Birbirlerini de tanıyorlar. Line halindeler. Kapasite dolduğunda sizi bağlantılı olduğu, aktarabileceği ikinci baza aktarıyor. Sizin konumunuz değişmese bile, burası önemli, siz şu baza bağlısınız, kapasite doldu, sizin yeniden bir baza bağlanmanız lazım, bir iletişim ile internet veya arama sizi petek sistemindeki en uygun olan, yakın olan baza bağlantılar. Yani birbirleri ile oraya aktarıyor. Siz yer değiştirmediniz. Yani konum değiştirmediniz. Burada, hani bazı şeylerde işte buradan buraya gittiği bazlar ile ilgili yapıyor ya, bu gerçek değil. Bu veri güvenilir bir veri değil. Bir meslektaşımız dedi, ya bazlar şey tutuyor, veri tutuyor. Bazlar hiçbir veri tutamıyor. Kanunen de tutamaz. Buna yetecek bir yeri de yok. Depolama alanı da yok. Dün Mahir bey anlattı. Bunları, bu acayip korkunç bir bilgi demek, bunu tutacak bir veri yok. Ha diyelim ki, tutuyor. Tuttuğunu varsayalım. Mümkün değil diyorum. O da öyle bir şey demiyor. Bilirkişi raporunda öyle bir şey demiyor. Bilirkişinin demediği bir şeyi iddia ettik. Peki bu veriler nerede? Adam diyor ki, ben gittim, orada 100’ün üstünde arama yaptım. 100’ün üstünde arama ne ya? Böyle bilimsel rapor mu olur? Ben 101 arama yaptım, 187 arama yaptım, 327 arama yaptım. Ya 100’ün üstünde arama ne? Bilimsel rapor böyle mi oluyor? Düşünün ki, insanların hayatı ile ilgili siyah ya da beyaz diyeceğiz, ya ağırlaştırılmış müebbet ya da beraat diyeceğimiz bu kadar hassas bir dosyada, ya bu ne cesarettir? Hani, evet özü itibariyle belki özü değiştirmeyecek imza konusu ama bu insanlardaki cesareti gösterecek bir şey. Bu insan kendi başkasının yerine imza atacak cesareti, cüreti tüm Türkiye’nin takip ettiği bir dosyada kendinde bulup yapabiliyorsa, bunu da çok rahat yalan da söyleyebilir diyebilirim. Ben anlattıklarını gelsin, anlatsın dedim. Gelmedi. Gelseydi kendisinin yüzüne söyleyecektik olmadı. Evet, şimdi bir de 22 baz meselesi. 22 baz…\n\n\n22 Baz Meselesi ve Telefon Sinyalleri ​\nŞimdi 22 baz meselesi. Evet anlattığım gibi petekleme sisteminden dolayı bazı bazlar ekstra alt baz olarak var. Dar açı jandarmanın dar açı çalışması var. Orada 13 baz verirken bu 22 demiş. Ya şimdi insanlar şunu anladı. Sanki bir telefon aynı anda 22 bazdan sinyal almış, oradan üçgenleme yapılmış. Öyle bir şey yok. Mümkün değil ki. Bu telefon bir bazdan alır sinyalini. Gösterdim. O uygulama bir tane deneyin. Tek bazdır programda. Söylüyorum, NetMonitör açık bir programdır. Bakın, yazar alta diğer bazların mesela görebildiği, sinyallerinin kayıtlı verilerini yazar ama bağlı olduğu bir tanedir, başka baza bağlamaz telefon. Mümkün değil bu.\n\n\nHTS Verilerinin Güvenilmezliği ve İddianamenin İnşası ​\nBir de bak, HTS verilerinin nasıl güvenilmez olduğuna vurucu bir örnek daha. Diyarbakır’da bir arama başlattım. Arabaya bindim, başladım, yola çıktım. Çınar’a gidiyorum. 40 dakika boyunca telefon ile konuştum. Şarjım bitti. Tam işte o 22. dakika, örnek veriyorum, Diyarbakır’da bir cinayet oldu. HTS kayıtları geldi, ben Diyarbakır’da görünüyorum ama ben aslında Diyarbakır’da değilim. HTS kayıtlarında o ara geçiş bazlarından hiçbiri görünmez. İlk bağlandığınız baz ne ise o görünür. Sadece gelen budur. Yani bu veriler böyle verilerdir. Ayrıca ben başka dosyada görmedim ama Levent bey dedi, biz dedi, dosyalarda bazen HTS kayıtlarını farklı zamanlarda istediğimizde farklı veriler geliyor çünkü bunlar sayısal verilerdir. Ne yazık ki, saat ile tutulduğu sorgulanmalıdır. Ayrıca şirketten gelen verilerdir. Bilgisayar verileridir. Bunlar üzerinde oynama, ne yazık ki, olabiliyor. Müdahale ile değil de belki bilgisayar hatası veya başka bir şeyle. Bu derece sağlıksız bir şeyle bir iddianame inşa edildi. Şimdi, peki bu iddianamenin inşasında yine bakalım, nasıl yorumlayalım? Şimdi mütalaaya göre hala durduğu için, savcım değişti mi duruşmadaki mütalaanız? Telefonlar açık mı, kapalı mı? Bizim müvekkile abinin, duruşmadaki mütalaanızı okudunuz ya o kısmı, yazılı mütalaada duruyor.\n\n\nTelefonların Açık/Kapalı Olması Çelişkisi ​\nHa tamam. Yazılı mütalaada duruyorsa duruyor. Şimdi eğer olay saatinde anne ile ağabeyinin telefonu kapalı mı? Bilirkişi böyle bir şey dememiş. Bilirkişi tek bir saat veriyor. Bilmez bilirkişi bunu. Nasıl tespit etmiş, bilmiyorum. Herhalde kökten kapandığını söylüyor. Ya hiçbir şeye temas etmemiş ama kendisinin imzalamadığı teslim tutanağına göre de dosyayı da teslim aldım demiş. Ayın 3’ünde, meslektaşımız anlattı, 3’ündeki teslim tutanağına göre dosyayı teslim almış ama kendisi hiçbir evraka temas etmedim diyor orada beyanına göre. Enes diyor zaten 6’dan sonra telefonumun şarjı bitti, -ki 06:13’ten sonra bir şey yok. Hiçbir veri girişi yok. Ne baz aldık bilmiyorum, telefonlar kapandı diyor. Hangi saatte tam muhtemel cinayetin işlenmiş olabileceği, saate anne için 14:28 ile 15:38, Enes için de 12:41 ile 13:41 arası bir şey. İşte onu da 50 dakikalık bir şey. Telefonlar kapalı ise evde olduğunu nasıl anlıyoruz o zaman? Bu birinci soru ki telefonlar kapalı değil. Bakın telefonlar. Rapor diyor ki, telefon açık. Evde sinyal almaya devam ediyor. Bu açık olduğu anlamına gelir. Eğer raporu baz alacaksak ama mütalaa ve iddianame diyor ki şüpheyi artırmak için, bakın bu gerçekten iddianame düzenlenince bizim de ya bu nasıl olabilir, insanlar hepsi soruyor, biz gittik telefonuna kesinlikle kapalı değildi. Şarjın bitti mi? Hayır. Çocuklar? Hayır, çocuklar oyun oynuyordu. Hatta soruşturma savcısı da çocukların, çocuklar evde. Bu nasıl olabilir diye sorduğumuzda, çocuklar evde oyun oynuyor diyor. Çocuklar evde oyun oynuyorsa telefon nasıl kapalı olabilir? Telefonun kapanması evet şüpheli bir durum yaratır ama buna ilişkin hiçbir veri yok. Hiçbir veri yok.\n\n\nGPS Sinyalinin Yokluğu ve Telefonun Kapalılığı ​\nSadece GPS sinyalinin olmaması telefonun kapandığı anlamına gelmez çünkü bakın akşam saatlerinde uyku halinde bakın geçen celse gösterdim, tekrar göstereceğim. Mesela Yüksel hanımın ayın 20’sinde saat 02:01:33-03:31:33 arası sıfır kesinti var. Yine 70 dakikalık bir kesintiden söz ediyoruz. Hatta daha fazla. 70 dakikanın üstünde. 80 dakikalık bir kesinti. Yine burada gündüz saatlerindeki kesintiye baktığımızda 14:28 - 15:38. Dedim ki şeye, bu işi anlayan arkadaşa. Konuşuyoruz, biz ilk celse anlattık, bu ne oluyor, niye böyle?\n\n\nTelefon Sinyallerinin Uyku Modu Davranışı ​\nDedi ki, telefon sinyal işi yoksa şeyle baz ile baz uyku moduna alır kendini o telefon için çünkü o telefonun benim ile işi de orada duruyor ama benim ile işi yok. Sinyal göndermez, veri almaz, veri yollamaz. Ama sıfır dedim bak. Yazan bir sinyal yollamış dedi. O şeydir, bir şey kodlaması var, onun dedi. 60 dakika, 70 dakika onun artık şeye göre değişiyor. Bazen iki saat olan da var. Bir hatırlatma sinyali gönderiyor. O da şu, bir telefon vardı o hala burada mı? Şey içinde, hiç veri gönderme alma olmayan sıfır. Dikkat ederseniz sıfır olan bir sinyal yollar, bakar yani telefon orada mı, değil mi. Bunun kalkıp telefon kapandı diye yorumlarsak şüpheyi artırmak için, ekleme bir şeydir bu. Bu eklemedir. Bunu kabul etmek mümkün değil. Bu konuda ne Diyarbakır Cumhuriyet Başsavcılığı’nın uzmanlığı ne bizim uzmanlığımız var, ne de mütalaayı hazırlayan savcımızın uzmanlığı var. Bu uzmanlık gerektirir. Eğer telefon kapalı diyorsak buna ilişkin bir veri olmalı elimizde. Bir bilirkişi raporu, uzmanlık raporu olmalı. Bunu ortaya koymalıyız. Bunun ile, evet telefon kapalı demeliyiz. Telefonlar kapalı değil. Bakın kendisi de söylüyor. Eğer raporu hazırlayanlar bu konudan anlıyorlarsa tek dedikleri diğer şey de telefon kapalı demiyorlar, sadece 18:13’te Enes’in okul civarında telefonu kapandı veya kapatıldı diyor. Enes zaten diyor, benim 6’dan sonra şarjım bitmek üzereydi, bitiyordu. Bitmiştir, muhtemelen odur.\n\n\nYangın Meselesi ve Şüphe Artıran Eklemeler ​\nYine Enes’in de aynı şekilde olay saatlerinde telefonu kapalı değil, yani burada ufak ufak şeyler, cehenneme götüren taşlar olarak döşenmiş. Bu insanların önüne mesela nedir yangın meselesi? Ben bunun ile ilgili bir video izletmek istiyorum. Biliyorsunuz, Diyarbakır’da Haziran ayında bir yangın başladı. Çınar’a kadar durmadı. TEDAŞ dedi ki, bizden kaynaklı değil. Anız yangını. Büyükşehir belediyesinin itfaiye raporu. Diyarbakır Barosu da takip etti zaten konuyu. Çünkü 16 insanımız öldü. Çok sayıda hayvan telef oldu. Büyükşehir belediyesi bir tutanak tuttu. Bu elektrik tellerinden kaynaklı bir yangındır dendi. Nitekim bunun daha sonrasında görüntüleri çıktı. Elektrik tellerinden bir yangın çıkıyor yaz aylarında yine. Yani burada şüpheyi artıran şeyler ekleniyor. Ne diyor?\n\n\nYangının Sebebi ve Elektrik Telleri İddiası ​\nYaz ayında, hiç rüzgar olmayan bir havada yangın çıktı diyor. Birazdan, 1-2 video var, tek tel, hiç tel yok. Tek bir tel üzerinde aşırı yüklenmeden yangın çıktığını gösteren video da var. Yani yangının çıkması için tellerinin birbirine çarpması diye bir şey şart değil. Bu bölge o tarihten sonra da başka yangınlar gördü. Yukarı Nasırlı Mahallesinde gördü. Yine Tavşantepe’de 1-2 sene önce Güran’ların yine amcanın tarlasında bir elektrik tellerinden kaynaklı bir yangın gördü. Hatta bunun zararı ödendi. Kendilerine elektrik tellerinden olduğu tespit edildiği için TEDAŞ tarafından zarar da ödendi. Yani burada bu yangın hiç çıkmamış, çıkmıyor diye bir şey yok. Bir de bu yangının kime ne faydası olacak? En önemli şey, bu yangın geç saatlerde çıkıyor, 22’den sonra çıkıyor. Şeyden biliyoruz DARAN-360 geç gelen kamera kaydı. 23’ü var ya oradan. Baktık hani acaba bir şey görür müyüz, tam yangının çıkma anında kamera da gidiyor. Belki dedim hani direkleri falan görürüz, çarpma telleri falan olmadı. Çünkü o anda kamera da gidiyor. Açılırsa oradan bir görüntüyü de birazdan izlersiniz.\n\n\nTerlik Bulunması ve Ailenin Erken Şüpheli Görülmesi ​\nTerlik olayı anlatıldı ya, şimdi her yerde her yerden her delil toplanmış, bu dosya içerisine bir çuval bulunmuş alınmış, bir kıyafet bulunmuş alınmış, bir başka terlik bulunmuş alınmış, yani jandarmanın kendi buldukları. Ya terliği de biri bulacaktı. Biri bulacaktı ya. Bunu bulan neden ki işte Arif bey’in yeğeni, kardeşinin kız kardeşinin oğlu sen nasıl bulursun? Biri bulacaktı terliği yani. Jandarma görmedi veya o çocuk o terliği düşürenden o dakika önce bulamaz mı? Terlik de benziyor, birebir benzeyen bir terlik. Terliği gördün, sen şüpheli bir şey yaptın, çocuğu alıyorlar şüpheli olarak. Bakın ikinci gün. Hani aile bizi yanlış yönlendirdi diyor ya, ya zaten sen aileyi ikinci gün şüpheli gördün. Ölüm vakası demişler. Çocuğa demişler. Muhammed burada söyledi. Katil ne yaptın çocuğa söyle çabuk. Zaten olaya böyle bakmışsın. Şüpheli olabilir demişsin. Bunun tutanağını da tutmuşsun. Artık sen beni yanlış yönlendirdiler, ben şeyi sordum basına, size bu patates hat meselesini kim söyledi?\n\n\n“Patates Hat” İddiası ve Sahte İhbarlar ​\nasın dedi ki, jandarma diyor. Allah Allah, dosyada hiç patates hat diye bir şey yok? Dosyada patates hat diye bir şey yok. Dosyada sahte ihbarlar var. Bu ihbarların en büyük kısmı aileye gelmiş. Arif bey’e mesela. Mesaj atmış biri. Ben Narin. Ya düşünün ne acımasız insanlar var ya. Nasıl acımasız bir toplumdayız. Ya bunu daha önce yaşadık. Yine deprem dosyasında gördük. Adam, ben göçük altında, kadınlar işte çocuklar mıydı, hatırlamıyorum. Ben göçük altındayım diye Afat’a sağa sola mesaj atan zalimleri de gördük. Evet zalim bir toplumdayız. Kızın elimizde diye arayanlar var. Arayıp çocuk sesi çıkaranlar var. Yani insanlar zannediyor çok rahat geçmiş, hani hiç umurlarında değil. Hiç şey yapmamışlar, çobanı sorguladığı şeyi gördünüz. Bakın Diyarbakır Barosu dediğim gibi burada saygı duyulacak şeyler çok yaptı. Ben yine söylüyorum, oradaki çevirinin yanlış olduğunu onlar da biliyordu. Hiç onunla ilgili soru sormadılar çünkü ulusal kriminal büro sadece kendi PR’ının peşindeydi. Ben, siz oraya yolladığınızda zaten keşke oraya yollamasınız dedim ve hemen itiraz dilekçesi yolladım. Gerekçemiz de sosyal medyada alenen aileye yönelik ağır hakaretler, alenen savaş başlatan kişiler ile direk temas halinde. Ya senin tarafsızlığına nasıl güveneyim ben?\n\n\nUlusal Kriminal Büronun Taraflılığı ve Siber Saldırı İddiaları ​\nSen tarafsız değilsin, tarafsın. Uyduruyor mesela. Ne uyduruyor? 46 siber saldırı. Ya bu adamlar doğru dürüst bilgisayar kullanmayı bilmiyor. Kim sana siber saldırı yapacak. İlk şeyde, işte patates hatlardan acaba bizi de o hatlardan tehdit ediyor. Ya varsa bir tehdidin, git et git şikayet et. Ya git şikayet et, durma. Tespit edilsin. En ağır cezayı alsın. İnsanlar mesela atıyorum bu dosyada şeyi de gördük. Twitter yargılamalarını gördük. İşte sohbet odaları kuruluyor, biri giriyor işte belli kendi aralarında şey yapmışlar, anlaşmışlar. Her halinden belli. Ben işte bilmem Ahmet Güran. Başlıyor oradakilerine hakarete, silahla hepinizi öldürürüm, bilmem ne. İşte gördünüz, Güran’lar geldi, bizi tehdit etti. Ya tespit edilsin o kim? %90 sizin ile parmağı olan, sizin ile şey yapıyorsunuz, orta oyunu yapıyorsunuz. Bunu da, sonra kamuoyu da, ya bunlar nasılmış! Ya burada bile şurada bile oturuyorlar. Tam yanımda oturuyorlar. Bir şey oluyor, bunlardan rahat yok diye tweet atıyor. Ya rahat ya.\n\n\nAilenin Durumu ve Toplumsal Tepki ​\nBurada kendi çocuğunu kaybetmiş bir aile bununla suçlanırken, varlık ve yokluk mücadelesi içerisinde iken, burada yer alması gereken asli unsurlarken, sen gelip varlıklarından rahatsız olduğunu söylüyorsun. Gelme! Gelme! Gelme! Buranın asli unsuru onlar. Yargılanan da onlar. Çocukları ölen de onlar. Ya bundan daha öte bir şey gerçekten düşünemiyorum. Herkes kendinde her hakkı nasıl görebiliyor? Ya bakın toplumsal olarak bilincimiz kapanmış. İlk duruşmanın ilk günü, Türkiye’nin aslında bir çoğunun saygı duyduğu bir Profesör’dür Erhan Şen ceza hukukunda. Masumiyet karinesine ve adil yargılamayı etkilemeye teşebbüs ile ilgili bir şey yapıldı, linç edildi. Adam bu suçsuzdur veya bunlar şöyledir demedi. Sadece dedi ki, masumiyet karinesi var. Bu yasal bir durumdur. Bir hukukçu bunu hatırlatmalı. Ne yazık ki! Görüntüleri çok kısa.\n\n\nYangın Görüntüleri ve Dış Müdahale İddiasının Reddi ​\nHani konu, diğer konuyu geçiyordum ya. Elektrik, evet bakın şuna. Yani gördüğünüz üzere bir dıştan müdahalenin olabileceği bir yer değil. Yangın çıkıyor. Böyle yine burada bakın, hiç evet yine rüzgarsız bir hava. Kablolar birbirine değmemiş. Yangın çıkıyor. Yani bunun gibi onlarcası binlercesi var. Biz Diyarbakır’da çocuk iken de bunlar ile hep karşılaştık. Hep gördük. Muhtemelen Türkiye’nin birçok yerinde insanlar karşılaşmış. Bakın, yine tek tel. Tek yani, başka bir tele vurma şansı da artık yok. Herhalde rüzgar da zaten yok, nasıl atıyor? Bu hiç olmamış diye sanki bir uzman gelip rapor tutmuş bir uzman. Ya da bunu görüntülemiş çok basit bir şey soracağım. Madem jandarma oradaydı, müdahale etti, başkanım niye bunun bu çubuk dedikleri bu plastik çubuklara neden el konmadı? Neden fotoğrafları yok? Neden dosyada değil bunlar?\n\n\nYangın Müdahale Delillerinin Toplanmaması ve Fuat Güran’ın Durumu ​\nJandarma oradaymış. Kişi ilgilileri de almış, nerede bu plastik çubuklar? Ya Kurtuluş bana anlattı. Yere yangın düşünce bir çalı kopardım diyor, yangını yerde söndürmeye çalıştım. Kendi evinin bahçesinde, ağabeyinin bahçesinde çıkan yangını söndürmeye çalışmasın mı? İşte, ne dendi bi battaniye varmış. Bakın bu da Diyarbakır’daki yangın ile ilgili. Evet bu da Diyarbakır’daki yangın ile alakalı. Dedi ki yangını orada ben söndürmeye çalışıyordum. Bir çubuk, çalı, çalıyı kopardım, vurdum. O çalı o şeye yetişmez. Tek elinde çubuk olan, kimde çubuk var dedim. Ya dedi ki, ben çalı kopardım. Hatta biri dahi koparmış olabilir, biz yangını söndürmek için o yeşil çalılar ile vuruyorduk. Yangın meselesi bu. Bu konuda, bakın hiçbir uzmanlığı olan birinin tuttuğu bir şey yok, evrak. Gelip burada, evet dıştan müdahale ile oldu veya burada başka bir şey var, en basiti bütün jandarma personelleri orada köyün içerisinde. Yani 3-5 değil, yüzlerce jandarma personeli var zaten. Hemen oradalar. Hemen orada bitiyorlar. Müdahale de etmişler yangına. Madem sen müdahale ettin. Ellerinde plastik çubuklar vardı, devlet malına yani ya da özel mülk mala zarar var, suç var, suç unsuru var. Nerede bu plastik çubuklar? Nerede bunun evrakı? Nerede bunun tutanağı? Niye bunun görüntülemeleri yok? Çünkü ben yapayım da olsun. Hani bu dursun ileride kullanırım ailenin aleyhine. Tıpkı işte Fuat Güran’ın bu dosyada tutuklu olması gibi. Ev aramasında, kendi ev aramasında aile şey diye biliyor. Hala söylüyorlar, tutanaklarda öyle geçmiyor. Çay dağıtırken değil, belki de ev aramasında çay götürmüş bilmiyorum. Pardon o da olabilir. Belki onların dediği gibidir. Ev araması sırasında bizi dinledi dedi. Ya bir insan düşünün, yeğeni kayıp. Yani şey düşünmeyin. Komplo düşünmeyin. Kendinizi düşünün. Sadece kayıp yeğen diye düşünün. Polis ve jandarma gelmiş, orada çalışmalar yapıyor. Ne yaparsınız? Ağzının içine bakarsınız. Acaba bir şey söyleyecek mi, bir bilgi var mı, haber var mı. Hastanede de yine doktorun ağzının içine bakarız, burada anormal bir şey görmek, gerçekten kötü niyetli okumadır. Adam arama sırasında ne dinleyebilir? Aramada ne konuşuyor olabilirler? Ev araması hazirun var, hazirunun da bu arada yeğenleri. Yani zaten konuşacaklarını onun yanında konuşacak, duyacak.\n\n\nRehineler Dosyası ve Gizlilik Kararı ​\nBu dosyada rehineler var. Gerçekten diğer dosya rehineler dosyası. Niye bize verilmiyor? Nahit başkan söyledi, ben bütün evrakları gördüm. Biz niye göremiyoruz? Ya bu dosya suç delillerini karartmaktan devam ediyor. Dosya kanuna göre açık. Hepimiz biliyoruz. Nasıl gizlilik kararı kalabiliyor? Talepte bulunuyoruz, ben işlem yapmayacağım diyor. Ya bakın, çok önemli hususlar var. Diyoruz, örneğin, bu dosyanın gerçekten aydınlanacağı şeyler, biz evet şu an sanık müdafileriyiz ama aslında evlatlarını veya kardeşlerini kaybetmiş insanları savunuyoruz. Onlar gerçekten bu suçta parmağı olan herkesin ortaya çıkmasını istiyor. Ben dün bir iki husus söyledim. Belki anlaşılmadı, anlaşılmayacak da. Çünkü biz burada da sizi eleştireceğim. Işık hızı ile gidiyoruz bir şeye. İnşallah sonumuz selamettir çünkü bütün delillere temas etmemiz gerekirdi. Bakın, ilk duruşmada HTS yoktu. Vecdin Bahtiyar geldi, benim ona soracağım sorular varmış, soramamışım. Yoktu çünkü. Biliyorsunuz başkanım, ayın 8’inde Nevzat Bahtiyar Tavşantepe’ye gidiyor. Çarıklı’dan çıkıyor, Tavşantepe’ye gidiyor. Buna şahitler var. Oğlunun arkadaşı Murat Tutulmaz yine bizim müvekkillerin, Enes’in üvey babaannesi Süheyla Özkan evlerine çağırıyorlar. Yukarıda büyük bir arbede var. Herkes perişan halde. Kimsenin de yemek yapma durumu da yok. Ya Murat da şey için gelmiş, hem İbrahim ile hem de Baran ile arkadaş. Onun için gelmiş. İbrahim de duyuyor Nevzat’ın oğlu ile birlikte yemeğe gidiyorlar. Nevzat Bahtiyar, Nevzat’ın eşi var, evde yemek yiyorlar. Evdeki yemek mesela içli köfte. Biz niye içli köfteyi belirttik? Çocuk hatırlıyor. Keşke tanık olarak dinleseydik. Bir kaç video’da olacaktı, sonra ama Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın ifadeleri var sonra.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Jandarma İfadesi ve Personelin Rolü ​\nŞimdi Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın ifadesi dosya içerinde. Allah’tan görüntülü var. İyi ki görüntülü var. Keşke bütün şüpheli veya işte bulunan sanıkların tüm ifadeleri böyle görüntülü olsaymış. Jandarmanın ne kadar kötü ifade aldığını net gösteren bir şey. Şimdi Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın ifadesi mi, ifadeyi alan kişinin ifadesi mi? Hani burada yönlendirme değil, yönlendirme hani belli alanlarda olur. Bu artık yönlendirmenin ötesinde bir şey. Adam kurmadığı cümleleri, ifadesinde geçmeyen cümleleri var gibi, Nevzat’ın ifadesi gibi yazıyor. Şimdi biz Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın jandarma kolluk ifadesini okuduğumuzda altında imzası var. Avukat var. Tamam, bu Nevzat’ın ifadesi diye deriz görüntü olmasa ama görüntüler var. Görüyoruz ki, Nevzat’ın ifadesi değil bu. Ne diyor mesela? Arama ile ilgili sen 15:08’de niye aradın diyor. İşte ben su meselesinde aradım. Peki diyor, sen pişman mısın diye bir şey soruyor. Hiç orada gerçi o da geçmiyor, kim aradı diyor. Pardon, jandarma personeli şunu ekliyor “Keşke aramasaydım, bunun içinde olmazdım, pişmanım”. Adamın ağzından böyle bir ibare, böyle bir ifade çıkmıyor. Yine olayın itirafı ile ilgili söylediklerine bakalım. Adam şey gibi, her halde Türkçe’den Türkçe’ye tercüme vardır ya, adam bir şey söylüyor, jandarma personeli her halde Nevzat bunu bunu demek istedi, çeviriyor. Çünkü biz anlamıyoruz. Öyle duyuyoruz. Ne dediğini duyuyoruz dediğinde ağzından çıkmayan kelimeler, ifadeler veya ifade ederken söyleyiş tarzında öyle şeyler olmadığı halde işte “Ben pişmanım, jandarma geldiğinde beni alacağını biliyorum”. Bir kere zaten hemen itiraf ettim demiyor. ilk başta söylemedim diyor. Beni bir yere götürdüler, orada söyledim diyor. Yani görüntüde öyle ama diyor “Jandarma gelince ben de bu olayı itiraf ettim”. ifadeye böyle geçmiş. Sahte ihbarlarda net yönlendirmeyi görüyorsunuz. Bunun gibi kaç yerde kaç tane Salim Güran’a yönelik yönlendirmeler var. Yönlendirmeyi dediğim gibi geçtim artık, ifade hani Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın ifadesi olmaktan çıkmış çünkü oradaki kelimelerin çoğu ona ait değil. İfadeyi alan kişiye ait. Yani ifadeyi alan kişinin ifadeleri diyebiliriz ona. Personelin altta ifadeyi alan diye imzası var. Aslında ifadeyi veren kendisi, Nevzat’ın ifadesi değil ki.\n\n\nSahte İhbarlar ve Aile Üzerindeki Etkisi ​\nO adam diyor ki, “Sahte ihbarlar geliyor muydu?” diyor. Evet geliyordu diyor. TikTok’tan geliyordu. O şeye yoracak, hani biz bulamadık çünkü sahte ihbarlar geliyordu. “Bunu aile yapıyordu değil mi?” diyor. “Yok” diyor, “Aileye geliyordu”. Sahte ihbarlar TikTok’tan diyor, aileye sahte ihbarlar geliyordu. Mesela diyor “Buradadır, aile gidiyordu oraya, orada bulamıyordu”. Demek ki, bakın aile en azından bunu anlatmış çünkü aramalarda O da orada ya, her yerden ihbarlar geliyor aileye. İşte dediğim gibi sadece Arif bey değil. Arif bey belli bir yerden sonra telefonunu bırakmış. Onun ile de ilgili neler neler söylenmedi ki. İşte bi Furkan emlak meselesi var, biliyorsunuz. İlk günler konuşuldu. İşte kızın kayıp saati sanki daha önce söylenmiş. Sonra anlaşıldı ki Amerika üzerinden alınmış o şey, paylaşım. O sebeple saat farkı yanlış yorumlanıyor. Bununla ilgili gerçi arkadaşlar hazırlık yaptı. Sadece yalan haberleri anlatacaklar. Çıkan yalan haberlere ilişkin sürekli aileye bir ihbar, mesela bir kişiye değil ailenin tüm bireylerine. İşte burada birini gördük, o onunla bağlantılı bir şey olabilir. Ama şöyle yapıyorlar, belki de hata yapıyorlar, gidip jandarmaya diyorlar ki, böyle bir şey geldi haberiniz olsun. Biz oraya gidiyoruz, ilk bir kaçına jandarma onlar ile geliyor sonra artık jandarma gitmiyor. Gidin bakın diyor. Bir şey varsa geliriz. Ya burada yani sağa sola saldıran, deli gibi arayan insanlara siz bizi oyalıyorsunuz deniyor sonra. Ya ne yapsınlar kişi bilmeyince yaptığı şeyler ne yazık ki sonuç elde edecek taraflar olmayacaktır. Bu şeydeki gibi, üfürükçü meselesindeki gibi.\n\n\nÜfürükçü Meselesi ve Jandarmanın Rolü ​\nEvet üfürükçüye gidilmiş, tutanağı var. Sadece siz bir üfürükçüye tek mi gidildi? Jandarmanın getirdiği üfürükçü de var. Tutanağı yok diye şu an anlatamıyoruz. Eğer bunun da tutanağı olsa, bunu da anlatsaydık, bize inanmayacaktı. Biz hangi yüzyılda yaşıyoruz ya? Jandarma alıyor, istismar ediyor aslında aileyi. Dini duyguları kullanarak istismardır. Hadi işlem yapıldı mı, bilmiyoruz. Yapıldı ise mağdurdurlar. Onlarında beyanları alınması lazım. Gidiyorlar bir üfürükçüye, işte anlattı Salim bey, tüm detayıyla. Üfürükçü bir adres veriyor, adres aranırken jandarma personeli de orada. Hazır üfürüyor, üfürüyor işte bir şeyler söylüyor, çocuğa bir şeyler soruyor. Küçük çocuk da artık bir sanrı mı görüyor ne oluyorsa, bir şeyler söylüyor kendince ya da geçtiği bir yer olduğu için aklının beyninin bir yerinde yer etmiştir, anlatıyor anlatıyor. Salim bey’de bakıyor bu kadar detay verince diyor, tamam biz bulduk herhalde. Dün anlattı, mutlu olduğunu söyledi. Erhan ile işte herhalde yaşıyormuş falan, gidiyor. Tutanağa göre konuşuyorum, “Jandarmaya diyorum, buraya gidelim. Kesin bulacağız. Bak diyor muhtar buraya gideceğiz eğer boş çıkarsa olmaz. Ben üstlerime karşı fırça yerim”. Yani askeriyede öyledir. Sen gittin, söyledin olmadı, fırça yiyecek. Emin misin? Eminim diyor. Buradan sonuç elde edeceğiz diyor. Yav şimdi burada bilginin kaynağını biliyorsun. Bildiğin bir bilginin kaynağını, birlikte gitmişsin, üfürükçü söylemiş. Sonrasında işte baskın olacak, ev işte arama yapılacak. Ya kimsenin şikayeti bir şeyi yok. Hiç kimsenin bir şikayeti çünkü durum anlatılıyor, Narin içindir. Evi aranan aile de diyor ki, Narin için ise eyvallah diyor. Hiç şikayet etmiyorlar. DİSKİ’de çalışan müdürmüş, neymiş ama aile bizi yanlış yönlendirdi, organize bir şekilde. Bir de ya organize nasıl bir şeydir ben çok merak ediyorum. Bu ifade TCK’da evet geçiyor ama burada ne organizasyonu gördük? İfade verenlerden Ramazan Atasoy elektrikçinin geldiği günü de hatırlamıyor. Görüntüler var, ben izletecektim Diyarbakır Barosu izletti. Artık gerek yok. Biz o kamerayı, evet bizde tespit etmiştik. Bir çok şeyi oradan bulmuştuk. Biz de anlatacaktık. Salim’in ikinci gidiş elektrik gelişi. Biz her şeyi biz de oradan bakıyorduk.\n\n\nKamera Kayıtlarının Öneminin Göz Ardı Edilmesi ​\nRuhi Tekin kamerası kameraları önemliydi sürekli ama davayı, iddianameyi düzenleyen savcılık açısından kamera diyor hiç önemli değil. Sizin bu kameralar ile ilgili işiniz yok. Yollamadınız sağ olun. İstediniz ısrarla, biz istedik. Siz de ısrarla yaptığınız duruşmanın üçüncü günü işte görüntülerin bir kısmı geldi. Diyor sizin bu kameralar ile işiniz yok. Ya böyle bir dosyada kameralar olmasaydı Nevzat Bahtiyar çıkar mıydı ortaya? Asla çıkmazdı. Kimse bulamazdı. Kusursuz bir cinayet işlemiş kendi açısından. Sadece tek şeyi, hesap etmediği kameraydı.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Yargılamadaki Rolü ve Karakteri ​\nEğer o çiftlik kamerası olmasaydı, bugün asla yargılanan kişilerden biri o değildi. Kimse ondan şüphelenmiyordu. Geçen celse söyledim bir hayalet ama bu celse saldırgan geldi. Saldırgan bir tavır. Bize patlıcan falan almayı teklif etti. Bakalım daha neler neler söyleyecek. Diğer avukat arkadaşımıza papağan değilim, bilmem ne. Aslında nasıl öfke duyup, nasıl dışarıya ifade edebileceğini gösterdi. Hani herkes anlatıyor ya, kedisi de dedi, ben gariban bir adamım. Böyle garibanlık mı olur? 10 bin lira indirimi kabul etmiyorsun, 10 bin lira. O adam diyor, kendisi ifade ediyor ama Salim diyor ki daha yüksek bir rakam söylüyor. 160-170 binden bahsediyor. O diyor ki 10 bin lira, 150 bin 140 bin diyor. Ben doğru söylediğini düşünmüyorum onun çünkü hiçbir şeyde doğru söylemiyor. Bugüne kadar ondan da doğru söylediğini düşünmüyorum. Madem ki Salim senin üzerine bu kadar baskı kurabiliyor, sana al bu çocuğu götür göm dediğinde yapıyor. Bir evin sıvasını mı sana yaptıramayacak? Sen onun hani adamıydın?\n\n\nSalim ve Nevzat İlişkisinin Bozulması ​\nYa zaten ilişkinin bozulduğunu anlayacağımız çok kritik şeyler var. Nedir? Onur bey ifade etti, telefon görüşme yoğunlukları çok önemli. Nisan-Mayıs’ta 47 tane arama var. Karşılıklı mesaj falan değil, sadece arama var. Evet, belli iyi görüşmüşler 21’ine kadar. Bu şeye kadar değil, 21 Mayıs’a kadar. Belli bu o tarihte olay yaşandı. Çünkü verdikleri araç meselesinin artık anlaşmazlık olup, bizim şeyde öyledir anlaşmazlık olduysa cemaate oturulduysa, burada eğer bir ortam yapıldıysa insanlar, büyükler çağrıldıysa bunun anlamı şeydir, eğer biz buraya oturup bir sulhe varmazsak biz birbirimize zarar vereceğimiz raddeye gelinmiş. Hatta Arif bey anlatmayı unuttu, muhtemelen bize anlattı. Baran demiş ki, ben döveyim mi bunu? Bu adam böyle bağırıyor, çağırıyor falan demiş. Oğlum biz kavga için değil, biz konuşacağız. Bir de eğer sen döversen, bu adam paramızı vermeyecek. Ben bu adam haksızdır, bu parayı ondan alacağım, olay bu kadar. Aslında hararetli cereyan ediyor ama şimdi evladını kaybetmiş bir adamın bu harareti anlatması beklenemez tabii ki. Onun için şey olan bahsettiğinde bile Eren’den bahsettiğinde veya kaybettiği işte ben söylemeyeyim, ben halini görüyorum çünkü ben çok onunla konuştum.\n\n\nSalim ve Nevzat İlişkisinin Detayları ​\nAdam oradaki para şeyinden dolayı sonrasında kesilmiş diyaloğu. Yani Salim hiç aramamış. Hani bir laf söyledi, Salim ben onu kovdum, yani git dedim. Hani bir argoda bir terim var ya, aynen diyor. Telefonda öyle dedim, kesildi diyordu diyaloğumuz. Salim hiç aramamış. Nevzat dört defa aramış. Haziran, Temmuz, iki sefer de Ağustos’ta. İşte son arama, malum olayın yaşandığı gün. Bir ihtimal de belki o köyde kimse Nevzat ile iyi diyalog içinde değil. Köyün önde gelen isimlerinden biri Salim. Ona bir tek şey veriyordu, biz onu da düşündük yani düşünmedik değil. Tek arkadaşı yani ona tek değer veren toplumda saygın bir yerde olan, onunla belli bir yere gidiyor, ben onu yemeklere götürüyordum, benim yanımdaydı. Arif bey bana diyor, ben hiç değer vermiyordum. Erhan bey de öyle diyor. Hiç konuşmazdım, sevmezdim onu. Hani ahlakı hoş değildi, sevmiyorduk. Salim ile samimiydi. Eğer bir organizasyon var ise, Nevzat’a yönlendirme var ise herkes şey ise niye herkes ifadelerinde demez ki o adam pistir, o adam böyledir, o adam bizi sevmez? Herkes diyor ki, Salim ile araları iyiydi. Bir tek aslında herkes gerçekten ne biliyorsa onu söylemiş. Bunun aile bu şekilde olmasını sağlamış. Nasıl sağlamış? Avukat tutmadılar mesela. Kim ne biliyorsa anlatsın, devlete çok güvendiler, dediler ki devlet kesinlikle hak hukuk değilse bu sınırlar içerisinde kalıp bu soruşturmayı doğru yürütüp gerçeği ortaya çıkaracaktır. Ama kişiler kendi kabahatlerini örtmek için başka tavırlar sergiledi. Bu dosyada hiç arama yok. O gün aradı diyelim. Yine istediği sıcaklığı göremedi çünkü aradan iki bayram geçmiş. Aradı yine, istediği sıcaklığı yine göremedi. Bunun sebebi kim? Arif o kızgınlıkla belki çıktı, bakın ifade de o gün sorduk, bugün sorduk.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Sulama Yaptığı Yer ve Narin’i Görme İhtimali ​\nIsrarla sulamaya çıktığında kendinin ön tarafa geldiğini söylemiyor. Biliyor, zeki bir adam. Dedi ya Fatih, doğru, zeki. O hortumu alacağı yer, musluğu açacağı yer ön tarafta. Yani Narin’in geçtiği yerde sulama yaptığını söylüyor. Unuttuğu bir şey var. Eğer sen sulama yaptıysan o çeşmenin oraya çıkmak zorundasın. Çeşmeyi açmak zorundasın. Çeşme Narin’in geçeceği güzergah üzerinde. Eğer 15:08’de konuştuysan ve çıktıysan senin Narin’i görmeme şansın yok. Ne olduysa orada oldu.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Eyleminin Ani veya Planlı Olduğu İddiası ​\nYa ani bir karar verdi ya da dürtüsel, daha önceden planladığı bir şey vardı çünkü anne, Nevzat olduğunu öğrendikten sonra “Ya Nevzat benim kızıma para vermişti” dedi. Biz bununla ile ilgili tanık getirebilirdik, getirmedik. Gerçekten biz bu yargılamanın akıcı olarak gitmesini istedik. Son, en son onunla görünen iki kuzeni var ya, Hatice ile Fatma. Ailenin söylediğidir hatta. Beyaz TV kendisi de, kendileri ile biz oradaydık, geldi kendi torununa ve Narin’e para verdi, bize para vermedi. Ya şu olabilir, oğlunun arkadaşı Baran. Onların kızı belki hani biraz daha aramız düzelebilir diye de vermiş olabilir. Belki de başka bir şey yatıyordu altında, bilmiyoruz. Ne yazık ki, biz size söyledik, bazı sorularımız gümbürtüye gitti. Biz bunu biz sorsaydık, söyleyecekti ama mesela şunu sordu Yılmaz bey; dedi “Sen torununa bir şey aldığında mesela bir cips bir şey ona da alır mıydın?”. “Evet” dedi, “Alırdım”. Hani bunu bu niyetle mi yaptı? Dediğim gibi başka bir niyetle onu bilmiyorum. Sadece kendisi açıklayabilir. Zaten bu dosyanın karmaşık hale gelmesinin sebebi o. Hiçbir şey açıklamıyor. Sürekli yeni yalanlar. Bakın, zaten beyanlarına neden dolayı itibar edemeyiz? Şimdi bir insanın beyanına itibar edebilmek için beyanları destekleyen deliller, emareler, izler olmalı.\n\n\nNevzat’ın İfadelerinin Çürütülmesi ve DNA Bağlantısı ​\nAdam bir şey söylüyor, sonra bakıyoruz yalan. Somut delille dediği yalan. Ya gelmemiş işte, diyoruz ki, Salim’in araç hareketi yok. Şöyle o battaniyeyi gelip almamış, en azından burası kesinleşti. Kalk de ki, battaniyeyi almamış, battaniye yok. O zaman değiştir yeniden bir şey söyle, bir şey üret? Hayır, hala aynı yalanı sürdürmek zorunda çünkü DNA ile bağlantı kurması lazım bununla. Yoksa Salim’in arabasındaki DNA’yı kurup ölümü kurup ölümü onun üzerine yığıp kendisinin sadece suç delillerini karartmadan nasıl sorumlu gösterebilir? İşte böyle bir kurgusu var. Ya bunu akıl alması, yani mümkün değil. Bakın, zaten atf-ı cürümün ne olduğunu biliyoruz. Hukukçular burada çok, anlatmaya gerek yok. Beyanlarının desteklenmesi gerekiyor. Beyanları çürüyor sürekli. Önemli bir şeydi dediğim gibi, yarım kalmıştı. Şimdi oraya döneyim. Ayın 8’inde Nevzat Çarıklı’da çalışıyor, akşam eve geliyor. Akşam eve geldiğinde evlerinde içli köfteymiş yemek. Bunun tanıkları var.\n\n\nVecdin Bahtiyar’ın Şüpheli Hareketleri ve Telefon Görüşmeleri ​\nKeşke dinleseydik çünkü bu olayı bilenlerin olduğunu düşündüğümüz, belki içinde değillerdir, suç delilerini gizlemede, karartmada ona yardım edenler var diye düşünüyoruz. Hatta daha iddialı şeylerimiz olur da ama ispatlayamacağımız için söyleyemiyoruz. Geliyor Tavşantepe’ye, yemek yiyor, oturuyor. Aynı sofrada olanlar var. Akşam 8’e doğru Vecdin onu arıyor. HTS kayıtlarında var. Vecdin o gün bütün gün birlikteler. Burada da dedi ki, “Kahvedeydik, hatta ben gidemedim Tavşantepe’ye”. İlk başta öyle dedi, sonra “Kahvedeydik, Çarıklı’da birlikte oturduk” diyor. Sen Çarıklı’da oturduğun adam ile üç dakikaya kadar ne konuşacaksın? Yine yalan söylüyor. Ha yalan söyleyebilir, bu onun hakkıdır, savunma hakkıdır ama bakın Vecdin’in çok şüpheli hareketleri var. Jandarma da kısmen anlamış, çözememiş. Vecdin belki Salim ile köprü değil. Bu taraf bir şey biliyor mu, eğer biliyorsa Nevzat’a kaç emri verecek. Diyecek, kaç seni öldürür bunlar, anlar. Ben de öyle okudum. Ben de öyle okudum. Bir de jandarma diyor ya, ardışık arama. Ben de onu böyle okuyorum.\n\n\nVecdin’in Bilgi Sızdırma İhtimali ​\nVecdin cenaze bulunana kadar Salim’i arıyor. Bilgi alıyor, bilgi aldıktan sonra Nevzat’a bilgi veriyor. Korkma diyor, bir şey yok, onlar anlamamış seni. Sen de git, belki aramalara katıl diyor. Ben böyle okuyorum. Vecdin çalışmak için Hatay’a gidiyor. 5 gün veya 6 gün kalıyor. 5 gün kalıyor sanırım. Hatay’a git, bir TOKİ işine, sadece beş gün çalış. Bu olağan hayat içerisinde mümkün değil. Ona bilgi gidiyor, bilgi gidiyor. Ben böyle düşünüyorum, böyle okuyorum. Aksi için keşke gelseydiler, sorgulasaydık. Mesela, sen o gün niye Tavşantepe’yw gelmediğini söylüyorsun ama Tavşantepeye geldin ve o gün ne oldu? Sen köy halkısın, sana kimse gelme diyemez çünkü şehirden akrabaları bile gitmiş, şey almamışlar, Arif bey’in evine almamışlar. Oraya bir koridor var almıyorlar aile bireylerini ama Tavşantepe’ye gitmek isteyen yakınları bile gidiyorlar, Diyarbakır’da ikamet eden yakınları gidiyor. Kendisi de gitmiş ama diyor güvenlik nedeniyle beni bırakmadılar. Yalan söylüyor çünkü tanıklar var. Keşke dinletseydik. Oradan da bir şey çıkacak. Vecdin önce bir kısa, sonra uzun bir arama dediğim gibi üç dakikaya yakın bir arama yapıyor.\n\n\nCesedin Bulunma Anı ve Vecdin’in Rolü ​\nMuhtemelen diyor ki, artık bu iş benim tahminim, hatta ihbarı yapan da Vecdin olabilir, çünkü aile şunu diyor bize, 7’sinde bütün akşam bütün jandarma her şeyi ile çekildi. Köyde bir baktık kimse yok. Sabah bütün basın biliyor bunu, arama yapılacağı bölgeden AFAD çıkarılıyor, o bölgeden çıkarılıyor arama-kurtarma, diğer tarafa gidin deniyor. Diğer şeyleri de çıkarılıyor, jandarma o bölgede başlıyor tek başına aramaya ve zaten kısa bir süre içerisinde bulunuyor. Ne tesadüftür, baş rolümüz Vecdin’e bakın, sabah 06:34’te Vecdin ile Nevzat arasında yine bir iletişim başlıyor. Bunların hepsine bir tesadüf mü diyelim? Biz demiyoruz ama dinleyemedik ilk başta. HTS yoktu. Onlardan dolayı soramadık. Bakın pür dikkat dinliyor. Hiçbirini dikkatli dinlemeyen, buraları dikkatli dinliyor çünkü doğruluk payı olduğunu biliyor. Bunlar temas etmiş. Gerçek evraklar üzerinden konuşuyoruz. O akşam yakalanacağının kendisine bilgi geldi belki de. Ahırda buna ilişkin ahır bölgesi belki aransaydı, ahır mı olur veya yan taraftaki diğer taraf olur, oralarda yani Narin’in son görüldüğü yerde mavi ışıkla her yerde arama yapılmış ya. Taşlara bakılmış, bir kan var işte bu kan var diğer yerlere bakılmış. Keşke oralarda da yapılsaydı çünkü son görüldüğü yer zaten duruşma da söyledim, ayın 2’sinde tutulan bir tutanak var. Hayalet lafı oradan geliyor. Narin Güran’ın en son görüldüğü yer artık kesinleşmiş. Okul kamerasına göre orası, Maide’nin ifadesini alalım, en son gören o diyelim, yine benzer bir yerde gördüğünü söylüyor.\n\n\nNarin’in Son Görüldüğü Yer ve Nevzat’ın Evinin Gizlenmesi ​\nEn yakın yer tartışmasız Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın evi ve ahırı. Tutanak şöyle, Narin’in son görüldüğü yere yakın yerlerde yakın aile dışında kimsenin evi olmaması; Amca Salim Güran, büyük amca Hüseyin Güran, bir de Fuat Güran’ın evi dışında bir ev bulunmaması nedeniyle bir tutanak tutulmuş. En yakın ev Nevzat’ın. Niye o yok tutanakta? Fuat’ın evi 400 metre uzaklıkta. Hüseyin Güran’ın evi 250-300 metre uzaklıkta. Baba Arif Güran’ın evi 100 metreden fazladır uzaklığı. Nevzat’ın evi ise 20 metre değil. Niye yok tutanakta? Ya bu adamı, hani diyorlar siz niye söylemediniz? Kimse fark edememiş ki! Adam dediğim gibi bir hayalet gibi. Adam geliyor, aramalarda en önde, yerde yer alıyor, oturuyor, teselli ediyor babayı.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Bilgi Toplama Çabası ve Köy Kameralarının Önemi ​\nYani her şeyde orada her taşın altında çünkü bilgi alması gerekiyor ve bilgileri de belki tek başına analiz edemediği için güvendiği aklına da güvendiği kardeşine aktarıyor. Kardeşi ile analiz ediyor. Zaten ilk başta koruma dürtüsüyle ifadeler farklı. İlk alınan ifadelere baktığımızda Gazal hemen onu evden çıkartıyor. Hemen evden gitti diyor. Konuştu sonra aşağı araba ile indi falan. Ya biz şeyi de düşündük, bulamadık. Ya acaba bu köyden daha erken çıkmış olabilir mi? İşte o kameralar bunun için de önemliydi.\n\n\nKöy Giriş Kameralarının İncelenmemesi ​\nNahit bey dedi ya, kamera köyü görmüyor, kamera köyü görmüyor diye alınmıyor diye bir şey mi var ya? Bir kaçırma vakasıdır, köye gelen tüm yolları gören çok kaliteli, çok çok kaliteli çekim yapabilen bir kamera var. Bu kamera nasıl alınmaz ya? Bu çocuk eğer köyden kaçırıldıysa yolların hepsine bakmak gerekmeyecek mi? Bütün güzergahları, yani yaya olarak da kaçırılsa, bakın çobanı kaçış güzergahı, işte o tarafa gelişi, su kanalına gidiş, her yeri görüyor bu kamera. Her yeri görüyor. Kameraya gidilmiş, bakılmış. Evet böyle bir kamera var denilmiş. Bir dakikalık sanırım 30 saniyelik bir görüntü alınmış. İşte köyü görmüyor, işte köye geldiğinde, evet vadiye iniyor, görmüyor, biz bunu almayalım demişler, almamışlar.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Oğlunun Varlığı ve Mehmet Bahtiyar’ın Mazereti ​\nNe zaman akıllarına gelmiş? Narin’in cansız bedenine ulaşılınca. Bakın bu kamera sizin elinizin altında. Alın ya! Ne yer kaplayacak? İlgisiz yerleri zaten almışsınız ki ilgisiz görünüyor, belki ilgili olacaktı. Almak ile iyi etmişsiniz, onu da alsaydınız. Bu adam gittiğinde tek miydi? Bizim onun ile ilgili şüphemiz, tek değildi belki çünkü evde olanları gizleme gereği duyuyor. Küçük oğlu evde. Bence gizliyor, evde değil diyor. Gelin evde değil diyor. Bazen evde, bazen evde değil. Onda öyle seçimlik yapıyor. Şimdi Mehmet Bahtiyar o gün, bütün gün pirinçlikte olduklarını söylüyor. İlk başta formun iç güdüsüne bakın. Tasarlamış, kurgulamış, hazırlamış ama kendisi kabul etmiş, bilmiyor çünkü ilk başta belki kabul etmeyecekti. Sonra artık ne hikmetse, ne oldu bilmiyoruz, kabul etmiş. Bilmiyoruz, ailesinden kimseye karışılmayacağına dair bir vaat mı aldı? Bir söz mü aldı? Bilmiyorum artık. Bunları da düşünür olduk. Gerçekten bunları da düşünür olduk. ### Şüpheli Kapsamının Tutarsızlığı ve Tutuklama Kararları\nEğer ki sen bu taraftan bir kişiyi saat hatası yaptı diye şu an tutukluyorsan ya da biri terlik buldu diye tutukyorsan, direk açıkça adamın orada olduğu kamera kayıtları ile belli, kendi beyanı ile belli, adam diyor ki biz bütün gün pirinçlikteydik. Ya sen bunu da al, bir şüpheli olarak al en azından. Ya tamam, tutuklama. Tutuklama istisnai bir müessesedir. Biz de katılıyoruz. Özgürlükçü olalım ama şüpheli bir durum, şüpheli olarak al. Bir ifadesini, Gazal Bahtiyar’ın al ifadesini şüpheli olarak. Biz talepte bulunduk belki onun telefonunu kullandı diyoruz, bilmiyoruz çünkü 28’inde hiç arama yok. Bu adamdan ne dışarıdan biri onu aramış, ne o aramış. Ne yaşandı o gün? Balığa gittiğini biliyoruz, arabasını tamire götürdüğünü biliyoruz. Nereden biliyoruz? Çocuklarının arkadaşları var, ya köyde Baran da arkadaşları oradan mesela oradan konuşuyorlar. Köyde kim var, kim yok mesela konuşuluyor. Adam gitmiş balığa diyor, Allah biliyor niye gitti! Balığa gittiğini söylüyor ama ne olduğunu bilmiyoruz. Gitmiş arabasını tamir ettirmiş. Niye ettirdi acaba? Bilinmeyen o kadar karanlık şey var ki kendisi ile ilgili, ben yine söylüyorum bu adam köyden kaçta çıktı, belli değil. Çünkü aynı çuvallar Çarıklı’daki evinde de var. Orada el konulan çuvallar da seri numaralı. Yine aynı gübre şeyleri ile aynı. bB adam nereye gitti? Çünkü bir tuhaflık var yani gerçekten bu durumda tuhaflık var.\n\n\nDaraltılmış Bazın Mantıksızlığı ve Olayın Ani Gelişme İhtimali ​\nYani şey bağlıyor elimizi daraltılmış baz diye bir ucube var ya. Bilmiyoruz 35, hiç ahıra girmemiş ama 35’e kadar yani sonrasında da dediğim gibi bir kere matematiksel olarak bakalım. Şimdi geldi, evde Narin nasıl bu cereyan edecek? Nasıl Salim’e haber verilecek? Ya akıl sahibiyiz, buyurun hesaplayalım. İnsan faktörünü de koyalım içerisine. Evde istediğiniz sanık üzerinden Narin’in ölümüne sebebiyet verelim sonra kurgulayalım. Mümkün mü? Mantıksal olarak mümkün değil. Bu ancak ani gelişen, bir kişinin gerçekleştirip daha sonrasında bir kaç dakika düşünmesi gerekecek, ben ne yaptım nasıl oldu, nasıl oldu diye düşünecektir. Sonrasında da bir plan yapıp, o planı uygulayacaktır. Tam bu işte uyuyor, birebir uyuyor. Bu zamanlama ancak buna uyar, başka hiçbir şeye uymaz, uyamaz. Şimdi aile kendi evinde ise önce nasıl oldu?\n\n\nAilenin Davranışları ve Cinayet Planı İddiası ​\nYaşıyor mu bir bakar, hastaneye götürmek ister. Bunlar olmadan, yani ancak şöyle olur, plan şu olursa olur, öldürme planı olacaktır. Eğer buna da insanlar inanıyorsa bir şey diyemem. Öldürme planı olacaktır, geldiği gibi hemen öldürecektir ki, onda da niye Nevzat’a ihtiyaç duysun? Niye yeni bir şahide ihtiyaç duysunlar ki bu kimin aklına yatıyor? Bu mümkün değil. Olası değil. Şimdi Salim’den iyi mi biliyor Nevzat köyü? Arabası mı var? Yok. Onun da arabası var. Niye yeni bir tanık çıkarsın? Ya dediğim gibi bir çok şey beyanlarını doğrulamıyor. Daraltılmış bazı da doğrulamıyor. Şimdi, adım sayar, bence en önemli şey buydu. Benim gözümde bu davanın düğüm noktasını çözen buydu ama biz bulmadık. Bir görme engelli kardeşimiz buldu. Allah ondan razı olsun. Biz dosyayı aldığımızda biz de Salim’den şüpheleniyorduk. Eğer bu anlatılanlar doğruysa, bir dakika dedik, Arif bey’e de söyledim, Arif bey dedi ki, “Ben güveniyorum. Sen sorguluyorsan senin bildiğin bir şey var, sorgula” dedi. Dedim ben soru da soracağım ona. Bir bakalım nedir. Hani duruşma daha iddianame düzenlenmeden çünkü bu aramaları niye sildin dedik. Kendince bir sebebi var, anlatıyor adam inanırsın, inanmazsın. Şimdi adam Diyarbakır merkeze gelmiş başkanım.\n\n\nSalim’in Adım Sayarı ve Kişisel Uygulamaları ​\nÖzel hayata belki gireceğim kusura bakmayın. Ailesinden de olanlar bilecek artık bilsinler. Telefonunda bir uygulama var. Kalemde açtığımızda gördük. Salim bey, kusura bakmayın, kaçamak diye bir uygulama. Ya demek ki bu adam kendince yani bir şey yapmış. Yani kendi ayıbıdır, kendi şeyidir. Kendi ayıbını örtmek istemiş. Belki de adam Diyarbakır merkeze gelmiş çocukları ile, belki de o arada WhatsApp’tan veya başka bir yerden bir şey oldu. Çünkü 21’inde Nevzat öncesi ve sonrası o araları silmiş. Belki o ara yazışma, bir şey devam etti diye düşünüyorum ama ispatlayamam. Kendi söylerse söyler, söylemezse de bir şey diyemem. Evet, telefonunda bir tane kalmış ama ben onun tek o olduğunu düşünmüyorum. Arif bey şaşırdı mesela. Ben Arif bey ile paylaştım. Dedim ya böyle bir şey varmış. Ya dedi herkesten beklerim ama ondan beklemeyiz. Evine ve çocuklarına çok sadık biridir. Ya artık kendi şeyidir, bir şey diyemem.\n\n\nAilenin Aşırı Derecede İncelenmesi ve Gizlilik İhlalleri ​\nBu ailenin o kadar namahremine girildi ki, bütün taşlar döküldü ki, ya düşünün köyde bir kaz meselesi bile dosyada var. Cinayet sebebi yapılacaktı. Yansımış evraklara, bilmiyorsanız onu da ben söyleyeyim. Bir kaz çalınmış. Kaz ile ilgili bile kaç ay öncesinde çalınan bir kaz. Bunun bile incelemesine gidilmiş. Ya her şeylerine bakılmış, her şeylerine. Ben iddia ediyorum ki, kimse yoktur ki, bu bölgede böyle her şeyine bakılsın. Her ailede böyle bir kriminal tip ya da böyle enteresan işlere, antin kuntin işlere giren biri çıkar. Ya her ailede çıkar. Hele ki bu bölgede, köyde, kırsalda kaçak elektrik bilmeyen yoktur. Söylesinler. Silah olmayan ev hane yoktur neredeyse burada. Eğer silahın yok. Bura tek değil, Türkiye’nin birçok kırsal bölgesinde, ne yazık ki, böyle işte. 90’ları yaşamışlar. Sonrasını bilmiyorlar. Şimdi güç şeyinde yavaş yavaş tabi bu silahsızlanmaya doğru gidiyor Allah’tan ama bir yandan da Suriye’den giren ne idüğü belirsiz şeyler var. Önlenirken devam ediyor. Cezalar caydırıcılık için artırılıyor. Ne kadar yeterli? Tartışılır. Her şeyine bakılmış. Bakın dediğim gibi hiçbir şey bulunamamış aslında ama sürekli, mesela, ilk günde katılan taraf şunu yaptı; bütün tuşlara bastı. Hatta dosyada olmayanlara da bastı.\n\n\nSosyal Medya ve Hukuki Hakaretlerin Eleştirisi ​\nSırf böyle bir kafada kirli nokta bırakayım diye. Lütfen kafamızda kirli nokta kalmasın. Dosyamız üzerimizde yoksa Osman’ın telefonu dendi, eğer bir şey olsaydı, girilirdi. Arif bey ile ilgili dedi, ben dedi, silme falan görmedim. Dosyada buna ilişkin bir evrak yok. Siz de zaten dediniz. Bu dosyada olmayan bir şey olmayacak. Şimdi, mesela silme meseleleri diğerlerinde benim iki müvekkilimde silme yok ama diğerleri kim silmiş dedim, Kurtuluş dediler. Çağırdım, dedim Kurtuluş dedim, neyi sildin sen? Dedi, ağabey ben WhatsApp’ı siliyorum ama diğer tarafta duruyor zaten. Örnek veriyorum, ben şimdi arama kaydını bununla konuşmuşum, orada silmişim dedi ama kişinin kendisinin sohbetine girdiğinde zaten orada yazıyor dedi. Halen silinmemiştir orada. Bir yerden sildim mesela böyle yapmışımdır dedi. Her yerden değil. Diğer birşeyi silmiş mesela, Fuat Google’dan işte geçmişi silme kendi ile ilgili. Adam Van’da kalıyordu kaç ay. Ne bilelim ne oldu, ne bitti. Bize ne, özel hayata girdik. Bakın insanların her şeyine girdik. Kimse böyle incelenmedi ya. Yedisinden yetmişine hiç suçla ile ilgisi olmasa da her şeyine bakıldı. Fuat sen niye arama geçmişini silme diye bakmışsın Google’dan. Aramalardan Google geçmiş silme, yani şimdi adam çalışıyor, işçi. Ne bilelim, ne yaptı? Bize ne yani. Bunu mu konuşalım? Konumuz bu mu?\n\n\nRamazan Atasoy’un Yanlış Tutuklanması ve Adil Yargılama İhlali ​\nRamazan Atasoy diye bir çocuk tutuklandı bu dosyadan. Baromuzun çocuk hakları komisyonu var, çok değerlidir. Lütfen o çocuk için de bir şey yapalım. O çocuk, bakın bir şey söyledi. Bakın ben ilk duruşmada onu gördüğümde gerçekten kötü oldum. Çocuk ölümden dönmüş, öğrendim. Bu dosyada tek çocuk Narin değildi. Çok çocuk mağdur edildi. Eren edildi, Ramazan Atasoy ediliyor. Dedi ki, ben bir şey bilsem, buradan kurtulmak için ne bilsem söylerim dedi. Kayda geçti ama o sıra bir gümbürtü oldu. İnşallah anladınız onu. Ben ne bilsem söylerim dedi ama çocuk her şeyi karıştırmış, belli komaya girmiş. Avukatı eğer burada ise bizim çevirmen Abdullah bey’e anlatmış, biraz o bana anlattı. Bir trafik kazası geçirmiş, ölümden dönmüş. Belli gariban bir ailenin çocuğu. Tarlada çalışmak zorunda, 14 yaşında. Bu olayda bir yanlış çeviri, jandarmanın yanlış çevirisi dosyada. Onun şimdi ne olduğunu herkes biliyor, başkanım biliyor, Diyarbakır Barosu biliyor. Yani dosyayı görmüş Aile Sosyal Politikalar Bakanlığı lütfen ilgilenin çünkü o çocuk haksız yere tutuklu. İnsanlar korkuyorlar. Şundan korkuyorlar, bakın az önce anlatıyordum belki kaldı mı, Ersan ŞEN. Gördünüz, izleyin açın görmediyseniz. Hiçbir şey demedi aslında. Masumiyet karinesi dedi. Adil yargılamayı etkilemeye teşebbüs dedi. Neler denmedi ki adama. Sen onlardan para mı aldın? Hiç tanışmadılar, temasa bile geçmemişlerdir. Adam zaten suçsuzdur demiyor. Türkiye’de bu dosyada adil yargılamayı etkilemeye teşebbüs etmeyen kalmadı neredeyse. Herkese göre bir katil var herkese göre. Bunu öyle cesur, öyle şeyle söylüyorlar ki, bazıları hatta mahkeme yerine geçip karar kuruyor. Karar kuruyor işte bu ifade de böyle böyle söylüyor, o kadar cesurlar. Kimse ile ilgili bir işlem yapılmadı. Bir kişi dışında. Sadece Arif Güran adil yargılamayı etkilemeye teşebbüs etmiş. Katılan şu an. Kendi nezdinde katile söyleyebilir bence.\n\n\nArif Güran’ın İfadesi ve Adil Yargılama Tartışması ​\nTamam kimsenin suçluluğu ispat edilmeyene kadar masumiyet karinesi, evet bir babadır, ciğeri yanmış bu sebeple bir fikir söyleyebilir. Bunu da gerekçelendiriyor kendince. Diyor ki, bana göre katildir çünkü diyor bu adam görüntüler ile tespitli bu adam hiçbir şey itiraf etmedi, sadece görüntü ile tespit olan kısmı ikrar etmek zorunda kaldı. Çünkü artık kaçamayacaktı, ondan. Yoksa onu da kabul edeceği falan yok. Hala da her şeyi kıvırıyor. Arif Güran ile ilgili neden sen katil Nevzat’tır diye dedin diye soruşturma. Ya hadi o zaman sahip çıkın dosyanıza. Herkes ile ilgili işlem yapın. Duruyor herkesin tweet’leri, haberleri, paylaşımları, söylemleri diyorum. Ya herkes artık iz altında. Yapın herkes ile ilgili işlem. Dosyamız ile ilgili konuşuyorlar. Yapın herkes ile ilgili işlem. Dosyamız ile ilgili konuşuyorlar. Adil yargılamayı etkilemeye teşebbüs, TCK açık, etkiliyorlar. Biz, evet istemezdik sosyal medyaya girelim, kadın programlarına çıkalım. Hatta benim bir arkadaşım, yakın arkadaşım çıksa belki alay ederdim. Mecbur kaldık, çaremiz yoktu. Çünkü kamuoyu yanlış bilgiler ile dizayn edildi.\n\n\nMedyanın Algı Yönetimi ve Malcolm X ​\nBakın Malcom X’in güzel bir lafı var “Eğer izin verirseniz medyaya, zalimleri size iyi, mazlumları kötü olarak gösterir”. Bu dosyada izin verildi. Fatih dün güzel bir şey anlattı. Enes iyi bir çocuk dedi. Ben de bir kitapta okumuştum, iki gündür düşünüyorum. Hangi kitap, aklıma gelmiyor. Sabah bir karakterin uyanıp saat 2’ye kadar olan hikayesini anlatıyor. Devamında yine karakteri anlatıyor, aynı karakteri anlatıyormuş ama öyle farklı anlatıyor ki hani olayı nasıl anlattığın çok önemlidir. Kişiyi sana sevdire de bilir, nefret de ettirebilir. Hangi yönlerini anlattığın, nasıl anlattığın önemli. Evet, dün burada kendini iyi ifade edemedi. Edemedi. Sinir krizi geçirdi.\n\n\nEnes Güran’ın Tepkisi ve Yanlış Anlaşılması ​\nEğer dedi, onlar da yanlış anlaşıldı. Eğer dedi, benim ailem bu işin içinde ise ben bunu bilseydim, bu işi buraya bırakmazdım zaten dedi. Ben hepsini de öldürürdüm, kendimi de. Ama ne anlaşıldı? Ama keleşi alırdım, keşke kendimi öldürseydim, onu öldürseydim. Bunu böyle demedi, demek istediği şu, ben sizin anlattığınız gibi, iddia ettiğiniz gibi ailem, amcam, annem arasında bir durum veya başka bir şekilde benim kardeşime amcamın bir zararı dokunacak, annem bunu bilecek, ben de orada olacağım, sessiz kalacağım? Bunun isyanıydı ama insanlar bunu böyle anlamak istemedi çünkü kurduğu cümleler sizin cümleleriniz değil. Evet kendini ifade etmekte zorlanıyor insanlar ama unutmayalım, ne baskı altındalar, bu işin sonunda ağırlaştırılmış müebbet veya beraat. Artık takdir dediğim gibi mahkemenin. Siyah beyaz’ın Yılmaz bey’in cümlesidir, çok güzel bir cümledir. Siyah ile beyaz’ın insanlar için siyah kart, beyaz kart’tır. Yani yaşama devam ya yaşamın sonu olacak dönemeçteler. Kimse hayatında burayı yaşamamıştır, buradan geçmemiştir. Bu bu şekilde bakılması gereken bir şeydir. Şimdi izler ile ilgili, geçen celse anlattım. Eksik kalan bir kaç husus vardı. Onları anlatmak istiyorum. Bu çocuk 18 yaşında. Dün bir görüntü gördük. Onu biz izletemiyorduk, cezaevinde imkan yoktu. Tespit etmiştik, fotoğraf olarak götürdük. Benim dedi. Sizden müsaade istedik. Başkanım bu dedik. Bu görüntüyü izletebilir miyiz? Hiç izletemedik cezaevinde, o imkan yok. Kendisi mi, değil mi? Fatih izletti. Evet kendisiymiş. Emin olduk hatta hala bile yok bu o değil, kardeşidir diyorlar. Kendisine soruldu. Kendisi olduğunu söylüyor. Mahkeme isterse bu konuda boy uzunluğu falan işte şudur, budur kamera açısından analiz de yaptırabilir. O mudur, değil midir.\n\n\nEnes’in Kardeşini Araması ve Psikolojik Durumu ​\nKardeşini arıyor, bulamıyor dizlerini dövüyor. Artık bitkinlikten yere düşüyor. Hani ben bir kelime kullanmıştım. Canhıraş. Tam işte onu gösteriyor, yani kardeşini delicesine arıyor çünkü belki kendi içinde şunu da düşünüyor; bendim, evdeki tek erkek benim de sorumluluk alanımdaydı çünkü baba anlattı, biz Enes o kadar efendi bir çocuktu ki kardeşini ona teslim ederdik. Hani yanında dursun diye. O baksın diye. Osman daha küçük hani Muhammed’e küçük bir tek o olur. Baran biraz daha haytadır dedi. O biraz daha aklı başındadır diye hani genelde onun gözünün önünde olurdu, o korurdu, kollardı kardeşini. Evde olan o kardeşi kayıp tabii ki bunun en büyük vicdani ağırlını kendisinde hissetmesi normal. Biz çok konuştuk onunla. Çok anlattı bize.\n\n\nEnes’in Savunma Yaklaşımı ve Mısır Tarlası İddiası ​\nBize bir kısmını geçen celse anlattı, bu celse artık oralara bile giremedi. Biz aslında dedik ki, kendini anlat biraz ama o ısrarla suçlamaları duyunca, kendi tercihidir biz karışmayız tabii ki, kendi savunması kendisi yapacak, kalktı savunmalara ilişkin. hani beni ne ile suçluyorsunuz? diye sordu. Mısır tarlalarına girmiş. Şimdi mısır tarlası bu çizikleri yapar mı? Resimleri göstermeme gerek var mı? Gerçi dosyada var başkanım. Geçen celse de gösterdik, her yerde vardı. herkes de gördü, yaprağın kesici unsuru olur mu, olmaz mı. A4 kağıdı ile ilgilenen herkes bilir ama ilgilenmeyene komik gelir. Çok keskindir ve kesicidir. Elimizi çok kesmiştir. Biz Üniversitede okurken işte şu an dosyalarda çok benim elim kesilmiştir ama bilmeyen adama desen ki kesiği görse, kağıt kesti, nasıl kağıt kesti? der. Keser. Yine yaprak incedir, sivridir, işte yok mısır şeyine kimse girmemiş mi? Girmişti. Kimse 18 yaşındaki haliyle insan faktörünü hep unutuyoruz. İnsan faktörü çok önemli. 18 yaşındaki haliyle kaybettiği kardeşi için gecenin karanlığında başına bir şey de gelmesin diye girip ararsa, yani kendi canını düşünür mü orada ya? Tabii ki böyle ölümüne aramış. Bakın dizlerini vuruyor. Dedim bir haber geliyor, bir çocuk var, resmi şey olduğu için ben hiç paylaşmadım. Özellikle çocuğun resmi hakikaten andırıyor Narin’i. Aile görüyor evet diyor, baba diyor Narin olabilir. Kendisi de söyledi, ben belki benzetmek istedim çünkü hani en azından yerini bilecektim. Nasıl psikoloji olduğunu buradan anlayalım. Bir yaralı ölüm döşeğinde olabilir, haberini bile insan bekler, bir umuttur çünkü. Umutsuzluk en kötü şeydir. Annenin de ilerleyen günlerde hani en azından bir mezarı olsun lafı, kayıp anneleri bilir, ancak hani onları dinleyenler bilir. Daha önce bir engelle çocuğu yetiştirmiş, annelik duygusu da sorgulanır. Neler neler sorgulanır oldu.\n\n\nEnes’in Kendini Yaralama Olayı ve Memorial Hastanesi ​\nBurada koçanlar diyor, değmiş olabilir. Bir, diyor ki, ben sonradan hatırladım. Ben hastaneye gitmek istedim, hastane konusu olmayınca ben orada biraz kendime doğru biraz hırpaladım kendimi diyor. Şahit olanlar vardı, biz onlara da mesela dedik ya şimdi şey denecek, bunu yaptığımız halde biz sadece bir para problemi ile bir de bakkal konusu ile şahit dinlettik. Aslında biz şahit getirebilirdik, çokça şahit getirebilirdik. Biz şahit getirmediğimiz halde işte Güran’lar bütün şahitleri hazırlamış, şahitler onların istediği gibi konuşmuş. Hiçbir şahit ile temas kurmadık. Hiçbir şahit ile. Sadece tutuklu olan müvekkillerimiz var. Onlar ile görüşüyoruz. Evet, size temin edebilirim hiçbir şahit ile duruşma öncesi hiçbir şekilde temasımız yoktur. Ne biliyorsa herkes anlatsın, maddi hakikat ortaya çıksın. Hani bir organizasyondan hala bahsediliyor, nasıl bir organizasyondur. Organize kelimesi nedir, nasıl oluyor? Bunu artık anlamak mümkün değil. Şimdi Memorial kamerasını istedik. Dedik ki, önemlidir sağ olun, heyet elden istetti. Bir kamera geldi. Ambulansın azizliğine uğradık. Ambulansın arkasında kalıyor. Ne için istedik? Gece saatlerinde tam o anda olduğu için sıcağı sıcağına olduğu için mor değildi dedik. Yüzde yüz anlaşılır bu çünkü olay gündüz. Hani bunu eğer oraya bağlıyorlarsa gündüz olacak olayda gece geldiğinde mor olmalı çünkü bir buçukta geliyor hastaneye. Gece 01:30’da falan gözüne vurma olayı olmuş ise daha kızarıktır mor değildir, o anlaşılır dedik. Diğer kamera da geldi. Flu, hiçbir şey anlaşılmıyor. İzlediniz mi başkanım? flu yani bu.\n\n\nKolundaki Isırık İzi ve Cezaevi Görüntüleri ​\nDedi, şey hani anlattıkları ile birebir uyumlu kolundaki diş izi. Ya kolundaki diş izi, bakın Arif bey konuşurken buradan hiç farkında değilken ben de elimi ısırdım çünkü Arif bey gerçekten vicdanı olanın vicdanına seslendi. İlk gün ben çok kötü oldum zaten. İnsanların aile yakınlarının da kötü olmasının sebebi oydu. Ben de babayım evlat kaybetmek gerçekten çok ağır bir şey. Yaşamadım, Allah yaşatmasın hani bir ikizimiz var bizim, daha doğmadan gittiler ama o bile anne için ağırdı mesela. Benim için tabii ki temas kurmamıştım, o kadar değildi. Evlat kaybetmek herhalde bu dünyadaki en zor şeydir diye düşünüyorum. Allah kimseye yaşatmasın hiçbir anneye babaya. Şimdi Enes orada, babası cezaevi görüşmeleri aslında yine hukuka aykırı delil ama dosyaya giriyor şimdi. Tabi tabi, bende oradan konuşamam, susmam gerekir. Şimdi Arif bey’in karşısında, Baran anlattı bana. Bir de Enes söylüyor. Geçen celse şunu da dedi, hani ben dedi, kendime zarar verecektim, babam daha fazla üzülmesin diye dedi, babasına ağlayamıyor. Erkeklerde vardır, bu bölgede babaya ağlayamayız. Hani gider, anneye naz tuz ederiz. Biz de zaten o kararı getirmiştik. Bekledik, hani şimdi biz ilk başta da hani buna itiraz etmedik. Hani dedik ki ya, şey deniyor ya, bir şey gizliyor bunlar. Ya ben diyorum, ya mahremlerine girildi. Cezaevine girdiniz, kişisel hukuka aykırı delil, ona da girdiniz. Baktınız kesip kesip bir şeyleri koyup, bakın bu niye böyle, bu niye böyle dediniz. Neyse sizin dediğiniz, ben burada fazla şey etmeyeyim. Annesine dediğim gibi ağlayabiliyor, babasına ağlayamıyor. Annesi o gün teyzeleri ile, şeyleri ile içeride ağlıyor. Bir erkek çocuk herhalde yabancıların ağlamasını, kendisinin ağladığını..\nEvet. Kolundaki ısırık izini anlatıyorduk. Şimdi, annesine, dediğim gibi erkek çocuk ağlar ama o gün annesinin yanında diğer kadınlar falan var. Gidip tabii ki orada ağlaması beklenmez. Anne ağlıyor, teyzeler falan gelmiş, başka kadınlar gelmiş, ağlıyor. Sonuçta yani bir kayıp vakası, endişeliler. İster istemez bizim bir de bu bölgede, böyle olaylarda iki kadın birbirini gördüğünde başlar. Hemen ağlamaya, ağıt yakmaya, feryat figan. O da annesinin ağladığını görünce insan ister istemez, yani şimdi annemin hiçbir şey yokken gözleri dolsun, benim de karşısında gözüm dolar, düğümlenir boğazım. Odaya giriyor, babasını fark ediyor camın önünde. Anlatımı bu. “Ben de o sırada hani babam sesimi duymasın diye ağladım, kolumu ısırdım”. Bunun insani yanına bakılmadı işte. Kolunu ısırmış hatta ilk günde haberi adli tıpa gittiğinde o ısırık izi anlaşılmasın diye ikinci ısırık, üçüncü ısırık falan filan, biliyorsunuz. Böyle anlatıldı. Tek ısırık olduğu zaten hem görüntüden belli, hem rapordan belli.\n\n\nKonu Hakkında Dizi Çekilmesi ​\nŞeyi ben unutmuşum, masumiyet karinesi ile ilgili Türkiye’de hiçbir olay yoktur ki soruşturma aşamasındayken hakkında dizi çekilsin. Bu olay hakkında biliyorsunuz birebir bir dizi çekildi. Bir bölüm buna ayrıldı. Tamamen Enes işte uyuşturucu bağımlısı değişik tavırları olan biri, anne yine suçlayıcı şey, hepsi suçlayıcı şeyler. Duydukları, basından duydukları ne kadar kirli bilgi var ise onlar atıldı bir sepete, çalkalandı, bir dizi oluşturuldu, yayınlandı. İnsanlar da ne yazık ki, bu ülkede dizilerin gerçekliğine inanıyor, bunu daha önce, biliyorsunuz işte yaşadık. Bir dizi karakter, öldü, bu ülkede insanlar cenaze namazı kıldı.\n\n\nAilenin Medyada Canavarlaştırılması ve Karşıt Algı Yaratma ​\nNe yazık ki Türkiye böyle bir dizayna gitti. Öyle öcüleştirildi ki, bu insanlar hani işte, ilk haberlere bakın, ilk kayıp kızını arayan insanlar sonrasında başlandı. İşte burada toplu mezarlar, bir çok çocuk mezarları var. Hatta ciddi gazeteciler daha önce de bir çocukları öldürülmüş, buna ilişkin otopsi yapılmamış, şüpheli bir durum sanki, bunlar çocuklarını sürekli öldüren insanlar. Ya öyle anlatımlar oldu ki, öyle öcüleştirildi ki, işte bunların köylerinde lüks lüks arabalar, hepsi çok zenginler. İşte Salim’in arabasını görüyoruz, kaza yapmış, diğeri broadway. İki araba kardeşi ile arabalar evinin halini gördüm ben. Evi ile ilgili aslında şeyleri de sunduk, onlar da şeyler için önemliydi, canlandırma anlatım için. Onlara da birazdan kısaca değineceğim. Ya öyle bir hale getirildi ki, dediğim nasıl anlattığı önemli. Malcom X’in dediği gibi, öyle bir anlattılar ki, kafamızda öyle bir Güran figürü çizdiler ki, bunlar her şeyi yapabilir. Bütün illegalite var bunlarda. Kimi çıktı dedi tefeci, kimi çıktı dedi işte toplu silahlar var, hizbullahçılar. Bir tarafa konumlandıramadılar ama şöyle bir şeyi başardılar. Tebrik etmek lazım. Solcuları, muhafazakarları, sekülerleri, hepsini bir cephede toplayabildiler. Türkiye’de kimse bunu yapamadı. Bir tek Güran karşıtlığı bunu başardı. Herkes vurun abalıya vurun vurabildiğiniz kadar. Ne yazık ki buna da hukuk sistemimiz izin verdi. Biz söylemek istemedik, Fatih bir taneyi söyledi. Hakaretler var, çok ciddi hakaretler. Hepsi hakkında değil ama kimisi hakkında dün gördüğümüz matufiyet yok diye takipsizlik veriliyor. İtiraz ediyoruz, reddediliyor. Yani normal bir şey mi bir insana hakaret etmek? Zaten şu an hakareti öyle bir basite indirgediler, ön ödemeye tabi tuttular. Parasını ver, istediğine hakaret et. Sen bana hakareti nasıl devlet bir para alıp ben vazgeçmiyorum ki? Bu Anayasaya aykırı. Sayın milletvekilim burada inşallah bunu taşırlar, bence bu düzenlemenin iptali gerekir. Böyle bir..\n\n\nHukuk Devletinde Hakaret ve Adaletin Durumu ​\nYani bu kabul edilebilir bir şey değil. Bir hukuk devletinde herkes kendi hakkını çıkıp yargı makamlarında arama hakkına sahip ise, ya sen kalkıp hiç bilmediğin bir şey ile ilgili klavye delikanlılığı yapacaksın. Ya iddia ediyorum hiçbiri Arif bey’in karşısına geçip bir şey diyemez çünkü böyle klavye delikanlıları var, arkadan söylüyorlar. Bize de söylüyorlar, herkese söylüyorlar. Var yani. Burada da var klavye delikanlıları. Şimdi yine sayacaklar, bize saydıracaklar, umurumda değil. Ne için? Çünkü ben vicdanen çok rahatım.\n\n\nEnes’in Sırtındaki İzler ve Yanlış Yorumlamalar ​\nBitti mi izler? Sırtındaki izler ile ilgili, dizileri söylüyorduk değil mi? Diziden dolayı işte dediğim gibi bütün bilgiler atıldı. Böyle bir senaryolar çizildi, anlatıldı. İnsanlar böyle dizayn edildi. Hakaretler, şeyler konu buydu aynen. Buradan oraya bağlamıştım. Sırtında sivilce olduğu net, net bir şekilde belli olan, sırtında sivilce izi olduğu net bir şekilde belli olduğu izler bile tırnak izleri dendi. Kolunun altında mesela sivilceler var, hiç alakasız konular. Ayağında da var. Yani her yer her vücudunun her yerine bakılmış. Her yerine bakılmış. Her iz birşeye yorulmuş. Eğer bir okuma yaparsak, herkesin hayatı ile ilgili bir okuma, başka bir yere çekme, bir yanlı bakma mümkündür. Herkes ile ilgili bu mümkündür. Bu herkesi art niyetli bakış açısı ile başka bir yere çekecek şekilde yorumlayabiliriz. ;Bu dosyada da bu izler şimdi şey bilmiyoruz ölümünün tam olarak nasıl gerçekleştiğini. Yani şu açıdan biliyoruz, yani bir adam var, senaryo çiziyor. İşi senaryo çizmekmiş. İşte kolunu ısırdı, kurtulurken sonra gözünün altını da ısırdı dedi. Ben dedim ki, Bu niye ısırığa takmış? İşte dedi Türkiye’de ısırıktan cinayeti çözen benim. Araştırdım, buldum. MazlumDer’in bir raporu var. Evet, bir cinayetten dolayı daha bir aileyi mağdur etmiş. 40 ay bu aile bu şahıs yüzünden tutuklu kalmış. Şimdi çok itibarlı diye her yere çıkıyor. Beyanları böyle. 100% sanki. Emniyetin şaşmıyor asla şey olmuyor diye bir diş izi nedeniyle bir karı kocanın tutuklanmasına sebep olmuş. Evet sonra katil başka biri çıkmış. Bu karı koca hiç ilgisiz biri çıkmış ve beyanlarını destekleyen cinayet silahı bulunmuş. Bir çok şey net 100% olmuş, Yargıtay onamış, o karı koca 40 ay hiçbir sebep olmadan, sadece diz izindeki uyum olduğu için tutuklu kalmış. Bulduğu cinayette, bu yani, ondan dolayı adam bir fetiş olmuş, diş fetişizm yaşıyor. Her yerde bir diş arıyor. Enes’in gözünün altında diş dedi. İşte Narin’in kolunu ısırmış dedi. Bilmem ne dedi, şimdi diş izi nasıl olmuş buna bakalım. Rapor diyor ki, üst dişte, şimdi eğer ki Narin’in ölümü ile ilgili bir şey ise ya Narin ısıracak ya biri onu kurtarmak için ısıracak.\n\n\nIsırık İzinin Adli Tıp Değerlendirmesi ​\nBunun olması halinde çok güçlü bir ısırık olması lazım ve kişi de kendisini çekeceği için bu ısırık derin bir iz ve güçlü olması lazım ve çizgiler, yani kurtarmaya, çekmeye yönelik olduğu için daha derine inmeli. Buna ilişkin bir iz hareketli bir ısırma izi olmalı. İzin böyle olmadığı net ve diş uçları ile diyor. Aslında bu kilit bir cümle. Şu açıdan baskı gücü ağızda çenededir. Ağırlık yani kuvvet noktası çeneden gelir. Adli tıpçılar bilir. Bunu sorarız. Anatomi işler, eğer diş çeneden bir baskı uygulamamışsa bu can acıtmaya yönelik değil demek. Enes gösterdi. Ben onun için şey dedim, kolunu koyduktan sonra kafasını üzerine bırakıyor. Ağırlık onun için aslında can acıtma değil, hani bastırayım kendimi. Ağlamamı kendimi bununla bastırayım gibi. Üstten geliyor. Bu beyanıyla uyumlu rapor da aslında uyumsuz demiyor. Eğer uyumsuz demiyorsa beyanını esas almalıyız. Aksi ispat edilememiş en önemli şey beyanı olmalı ama işte savcılık bu beyanı esas almıyor. Diyor ki, bu şüpheli bir durum. Bütün her şey anlayamadığımız her şey şüpheli demişiz. Bakın, şöyle olmuş. Küçük bir köy, 300-400 kişi falan yaşıyor. Herhalde köyde birden 1700 jandarma personeli ile karşılaşmışlar ve gestapo gibi her yerde bir jandarma personeli. Muhtemelen bir çoğunun elinde kayda geçirmek için bekliyorlar, her gördüğü şeyi kayda geçiriyorlar. Örnek veriyorum, bu buradan geçti, çöpü niye oraya attı? kayda geçirmişler. Ben öyle anlıyorum tutanaklara baktığımda. Her şeyi yani. İnsanlar sürekli ifade vermişler. Bakın, yani sadece şey düşünmeyin, yazılı ifade vermiş düşünmeyin. Arif bey anlattı. 6 gün kalmış şeyde. Narin bulunduktan sonra 4 gün 5 gün mü her gün diyor kaldırıyorlardı beni. Mesela gidiyordum benim diyor, Allah var hiç kötü muameleye uğramadım, kimse bana ters kötü bir muamele yapmadı, bir şey demedi ama her gün bir senaryo ile geldiler.\n\n\nİşkence ve Sorgulama Teknikleri ​\nVe çok tehlikeli yasak sorgulama teknikleri uygulanmış, birini duruşmada anlattı. Bence çok ağır bir işkence. Fiziksel işkenceden daha ağır. Demişler ki, sen şimdi Enes’i çağıracağız, diyeceksin ki Enes’e, annen demiş şimdi buradaydı dedi, Enes yapmış, oğlum Narin’i Enes öldürmüş, annen dedi bana. Ben diyorum söyledim Enes’e, Enes delirdi diyor. Kafasını duvarlara vurdu. Baba sen nasıl bana bunu söylersin ki, o gün duruşmada da söylerken Enes yine tahammül edemedi. Ya böyle bir şey var mı gerçekten? Benim tüylerim diken diken oluyor bunu söylerken. Bu nasıl sorgulama tekniğidir, yani bu nasıl yani daha yapılacak işkencenin bundan ötesi var mı? Fiziksel işkence bundan kesinlikle daha iyidir. Kesinlikle daha iyidir. Bu kabul edilebilir bir şey değil. Bakın 2024’teyiz. İşkencenin bir insanlık suçu olduğunu hepimiz biliyoruz. Bütün hukukçular bunu söylüyoruz, bütün medya da bunu biliyor, söylüyor ama bunlara yapılıyorsa normaldir diyoruz. Normaldir dedik. Ben ilk celse bir şey dedim, tepki gösterdiniz. Tamam haklısınız, konu buradan kaymasın ama basın bunu bilmiyor. Kusura bakmayın, bunu söyleyeceğim. Biz bunu konuyu söylemeyecektik. Biz müvekkillerimizin hiçbirini, madem ilk günler bu raporlar alınmadı, biz dedik başvuralım. Dediler ki, hayır başvurmayacağız. Bizim kızımızla ilgili bir durumdu. Bizim kızımız bulunsun diye bu bize yapıldı diye düşünüyoruz. Eğer bu kadar sert olunmasa belki kızım ben kabul etmiyorum bunu kendileri kabul ediyor ama ben kabul etmiyorum. Raporları yoktu. İşte görüntüleri alınabilir belki dedik, belki hani biz hastaneye gittiğimizde araçtan inmedik dediler. Araca doktor geldi var mı bir şey, yoktur herhalde. Hiç bize sorulmadan yazıldı. Bir kişiye verilmiş dedik. Ya bu bir kişi üzerinden gidelim, yok dediler. Neyse biz dedik o zaman bir daha açılmayacak bu konu. Tamam dedik, bir daha açılmadı. Enes burada açtı. Görmeyenler, bilmeyenler için anlatıyorum ya da anlamayanlar için. Heyet anladı o durumun ne olduğunu.\n\n\nEnes’in İşkence Anlatımı ​\nEnes’e sorular soruldu. Sen niye çelişkili ifadeler verdin? Sen burada niye böyle dedin? Enes dedi ki, siz benim ne yaşadığımı bilmiyorsunuz. Tekrar edildi. Enes, sen bak böyle böyle dedin, böyle dedin ama ben o zaman dedi bir şey anlatacağım dedi olmayacak. Tutanakta da öyle geçiyor, ben bir şey anlatacağım olmayacak. Şimdi dedi, anlat dedi, biz anlatman için buradayız. Soru soran hani biz seni dinlemek için buradayız. O zaman dedi ki, ben avukatlarıma bir şey danışmak istiyorum. Konuştuktan sonra konuşacağım değil mi başkanım? Tutanak aynen böyle duruyor. Görüntüleri de var. Şuraya döndü bize. Biz de şuradayız. İki adım attı, döndü anlatayım mı? dedi. Ben orada anlatmayın deseydim herkes ne diyecekti? Çocuk konuşacaktı, konuşturmadılar. Tabii ki bunu diyemezdik. Anlat, ne istiyorsan anlat dedik. Çocuk da işkenceyi anlattı. Sonra dediler ki, sen işkencede hiçbir şey kabul etmemişsin. Niye bu konuyu anlattın? Ya tamam kabul etmemiş, senin sorduğun sorunun bağlamı buradan geliyor, yani çelişki var diyorsun. Unutmayın kardeşini kaybetmiş, göz altına alınmış, 18 yaşında sürekli kafasında saatler ile ilgili bir farklılık var. Önemli olan saat 18 ve sonrası mı yoksa 15 ve sonrası mı. Çünkü 18 sonrası gördüğünü söyleyen var. Salim de düştü, yanıldığı bu saat, hangi saat önemliydi? Saatler ile ilgili kimse organize olmadı, tam aksine saati yanlış söyleyenler gidip sorgulanıyor. Canlı yayınlar var, dosyaya girmiş, sosyal medya paylaşımı birazdan meslektaşımız belki izler, belki videoyu izler. Arif bey ilk gün anlattı; Maşallah kızları 17:40 diyor, Arif beyler sorguluyor bunu. Nasıl 17:40? Neden sorgulayamaz? Hüseyin Güran’ın evine giden yol Arif’lerden gideceksen okulun önünden geçmek zorunda.\n\n\nAilenin Kendi Soruşturması ve Tanık Beyanlarındaki Tutarsızlıklar ​\nOkulun kamerasında görünür. Kameraya bakıyorlar, Narin yok diyorlar. Belki Jandarma diyor ki, arkadan belki dolandı ya da alt yoldan gitti. Arif bey, Yüksel hanım da röportajında söylüyor. Ya benim kızım akıllı bir kızdır, benim kızım eğer evine gelecekse, oraya gidecekse patikadan giden yolu uzatmaz. Yani neymiş? Organizasyon yok. Tam aksine sorgulama var. Gerçeği araştırma var. Bakın aile yani Arif ile anne Yüksel, baba Arif sorguluyor bunu. En yakınlarını sorguluyor. yine uzaklarını da sorguluyor. İsa Kaya akraba değil, çağırıp soruyor. Sen 18:00’de gördüm diyorsun, nasıl gördün? Nerede gördün? Sen tek nasıl görüyorsun? Başkaları niye görmedi? Çünkü orada senin dışında da insanlar var. Bir sen gördüm diyorsun, anne diyor, ben ortalığı yıkacaktım, yıkıyordum. İsa biraz büyüktür, o gördüm deyince biraz rahatladım diyor. Büyük bir birey geliyor 17 yaşında, gördüm diyor. Herhalde doğrudur diyor. Niye uydursun? Sonrasında Şeyma diyor, gördüm. Biliyorsunuz onu tespit ettik. Onun saat karışıklığıymış. Bir yemek programı şifresi verince, baktık, tamam. Program kaçta falan anlaşıldı. Yani bu da yine akraba değil.\n\n\nMaide Kaya’nın İfadesi ve Zaman Çelişkisi ​\nMaide Kaya küçük çocuk canlandırması var. Herkes onu izledi. İşte evine gittiğini söylüyor. Bakın evine gitmiş, işte en son gören kişi. Kızın söylediği saatte çoktan ölmüş. Narin çoktan öldürülmüş. O 18:00 sonrasına diyor. O 18:40’da gördüğünü söylüyor. Okulun orada oynuyor, kameraya takılıyor. Bakıyor diğer çocuk da diyor, ben duydum, Maide konuşurken ben Narin’i görmedim ama Maide’nin Narin diye seslendiğini duydum diyor tepeye doğru ama yok işte. Bakın aile bunları sorguluyor. Yani anne de sorguluyor kendi aklınca. Kendini ifade edebildiği sorgulayabildiği kadarıyla sorguluyor. Yani bu eğitim almış bir polis her şeyi bilen bir insan değil. Kendi aklı aldığınca algılayıp sorgulayabiliyor. Sorguluyor, bakıyor ama işte sürekli dediğim gibi ifadeler, yazılı olmayanlar dışında da sürekli biri geliyor, anlat bakalım ne oldu. Sürekli anlatıyorlar. Şimdi dediğim gibi önemli olan saat ne, hangi saati daha dikkatli anlatması gerekiyor, insan beyni belli şeyler ile kodlama yapar geçmiş hatıralarını. Bu bilimsel bir çalışmadır, birazdan bir meslektaşımız detaylarını anlatacak. Örnek veriyorum, ben bugün sabah işte evden çıktığımda saat kaçtı diye hatırlamak için ne yaparım? İşte telefonda biri ile görüşmüş isem ona bakar, bir kodlama yaparım. Diyarbakır Barosu dedi ki, mesela Birsen’e ilişkin kodlama yok. Ben de var diyorum. Onun HTS’sini sunacağım, Birsen’e ait. HTS kaydı biliyorsunuz Birsen’lerin evine okul kamerasına bakarsanız o gün çok çocuk gidip gelmiş. Çok sayıda, çok çocuk gidip gelmiş. Onların içinde Narin de var. Narin’in diğer kuzenleri de var. Maşallah hanımın kendi diğer yeğenleri falan da var. Çok gidip gelen var. Bunu kameradan dolayı anlayabiliyoruz. Çocukların da ifadeleri alınmış. Zaten bir kısmını söylüyorlar.\n\n\nBirsen’in İfadesi ve Zaman Kodlaması ​\nŞimdi ilk gelen, ikinci gelen saat kodlaması yapılınca demek bir hataya düşmüş. Şimdi az önce şeyin ifadesini gördünüz, Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın. İfade alınırken bazen ifade verenin ifadesi yazılır, bazen ifade verenin, yani ifadeyi alanın anladığı yazılır, bazen de ne yazık ki, anlamak istediğini yazar. Bu soruşturmada Birsen’in ifadesi böyle olmuş savcılık makamında alınan ifadesinde. Nereden anlıyoruz? Hiçbir şey olmadan muhtemelen bir saat falan geçmiştir. Sulh cezaya çıktığında ifadesi söyleniyor. Hani bu Salim’in yönlendirme meselesi var ya. İşte sen savcılık ifadesine göre sanki Salim gelmiş, ona 17:40 demelisin demiş. Sorguya bakalım. Sorgu da ne diyor Birsen? Birsen sorguda diyor ki, ben öyle demedim. Biz konuşurken Melike ile Salim ağabey duydu geldi yanımıza. Nedir dedi? Dedik ki, biz emin olamayoruz 17:40’da gelen Mina mıydı, Narin daha önce mi geldi? Çünkü okul kamerasında da görmüyor. Acaba biz yanlış mıyız onlarda? Çünkü Arif bey sorunca, Arif bey hani bir hatanız varsa bir daha düşünün deyince bunlar kendi içlerinde bir sorgulamaya giriyorlar. Bunlar emin olamıyorlar. Salim de demiş ki, ifade de geçiyor, doğruyu ne biliyorsanuz onu söyleyin. İkide bir ifadenizi değiştirmeyin. Bu çok doğru bir şey. Ne biliyorsanız ise onu söyleyin. Doğruyu söyleyin. İfadenizi değiştirmeyin. Ama savcılık Salim duydu, 17:40 ise 17:40, devamında da zaten şey de söylüyor, hani doğru ne biliyorsanız ise 17:40’da mı gördünüz 17:40 söyleyin. Savcılık orayı almıyor. 17:40’da söylememiz gerekti. Bu evet şüpheyi artıran bir şeydir. Bu acaba Birsen’in kelimesi midir? Bakın, gördük Nevzat’ın ifadesinde. Keşke onun da görüntüleri olsaydı, keşke onun görüntüleri olsaydı. Şimdi şey deniyor, CMK avukatı var. Avukatı huzurunda Nevzat’ın da avukatı var. Nevzat’ın beyanları olmayan şeyler geçmiş, kamerada var, hepimiz görüyoruz. Şimdi Birsen nereden kodlamayı yapmış? Birsen’lerin evine giden çok çocuk var. Birsen şeyi bilmiyor, duruşmada da söyledi. Camiye gittiklerini bilmiyor. Bu parçayı nasıl birleştirdik? Biz kendisiyle konuştuk. Duruşmada da söyledi. Sonrasındaki o Şeyma Kaya üzüm toplama meselesi. Tam anladık. Birsen Narin geldiğinde diyor ki, Hatice ile Fatma anneannemlere gitti. Anneanneleri caminin yanındaki o Şeyma’ların evinin yanında. Narin oraya gidiyor. Narin oraya gittiğinde direk bekliyor, kızları içeriye de girmeye utanıyor mu neyse. Orada Şeyma Kaya onu görüyor. Orada asma yaprağı topluyorlar. Ona üzüm veriyor. Bu parçaları böyle okumak da var ama insanlar okumayı tercih etmedi. Madem o kadar iyi araştırdın, 1700 personel, 17:40 diyor, bir de program diyor, aç bakayım o program kaçta? Bir de bak, biz açıp baktık, sen de bak. Bu kadar hassas bir dosya, bir bak. Parça birleşti. Direk camiye girmeye utanmış diyor. Cami hocası diyor, ben gördüm, çağırdım diyor. Diğer çocuklar ile kapının önündeydi, çağırdım geldi. Bu parça da birleşti. Camiye de geç girmiş zaten. Bu 17:40 meselesi ne olabilir dedik. Evet, aynen Birsen’in telefonundan annesi konuşmuş. Halasıyla konuşmuş. Telefon ekran görüntüsü de var. Birsen’in HTS’sinde 103 numarada Taner Mehmetoğlu adına kayıtlı telefonda 21 Ağustos 17:40’da. Tam bir göstereyim.\n\n\nMaşallah Hanımın Telefon Görüşmesi ve Zaman Kodlamasının Doğrulanması ​\nYok bunu sunmamıştım. O Maşallah hanımın HTS’si gösterildi. Maşallah hanımınki de yok. Birsen’e ait telefon numarası. Birsen’in telefonu üzerinden konuşuyor Maşallah hanım. Akrabalık ilişkilerini bilmiyorum, kocasının kardeşi ne oluyordu? Görümce. Görümcesi oluyor, değil mi? Hayır, hayır. Maşallah’ın görümcesi. Görümcesi ile konuşuyor 17:40’da. Demek ki, bir konuşma var. Kodlama böyle yapılmış. Annen telefon ile konuşuyordu. Yani bu kadar keskin bir zaman dilimi veriliyor. Ya biz de dedik, ya bu kadar keskin nasıl oluyor? Telefonla konuşuyor, hatta ekran resmi de var. Telefonu silmediler bize attılar. Onu da sunacağız şeyde ama bu HTS olduğu için daha güvenilir. Veriler ile her şey ile oynayabiliyor ya, bu aile nasıl oluyor bilmiyorum, kendi adım sayarı da bilmiyordu da..\n\n\nUlusal Kriminal Büro Raporlarının Güvenilirliği ​\nŞimdi Ulusal Kriminal Büro’nun raporları. Rapor mudur bunlar? Mütalaada geçtiği için değinmek zorundayım. Diyarbakır Barosu gerçekten dediğim gibi ben çalışmalarına saygı duyuyorum. Hukukçulukları en azından bir şey gördüklerinde bu yanlıştır demeleri ortada. Zaten diyorlar. Bununla ilgili hiçbir şey demediler çünkü onlar da neyin gerçek neyin olmadığını gayet net görüp şey yapabiliyor. Yargılamaya bu denli katkıları için teşekkür ediyorum. Şimdi oradaki konuşmalarda kesinlikle savcı diye bir kelime geçmiyor. Geçen çoğu kelimeyi almamış. Bizim duyabildiğimiz ama dediğim o konuşma bir anlam bütünlüğü yok. Kaldı ki bizce o delil hukuka aykırı bir delildir. Nasıl elde edildiği belli değil. Kanuna uygun bir şekilde elde edilmemiş. Bu sebeple onun da bizce dosya arasından, itiraz etmiştik. Bununla ilgili ne şekilde geldiğini bilmiyoruz. Bu evraklar nasıl elde edilebilir? Çünkü o kamera kaydı başsavcılıkta. Sadece bize kapalı olan dosyada. Oradan geldi. Onu kabul etmiyoruz.\n\n\nGörüntülerdeki Piksel Kaymaları ve Süre Farklılığı ​\nYine görüntüler ile ilgili, dün meslektaşım anlattı, bir yamaç ile şey hikayesi var. O çok önemli. Oradaki yamacın kamera açısından dolayı anlaşılmayıp düzlük olarak kabulü sanki var. Piksel kayması, yani görüntüleri aldık. Burada olmayacağını anladık. Kaç kişi ile görüştük, burada olmayacağını anladık. İşte meslektaşım anlattı, Tuncay bey kısmen yurt dışına yolladık, bekliyoruz. Duruşma sonrası da gelse artık belki maddi hakikate bir katkı sunacaktır. Orada piksel kayması görüntüleri alıp aileye yolladığımda, işte bak Nevzat burada alıyor. İşte bak, Nevzat burada alıyor falan diye bana heyecanlı olarak. Dedim ki sizin gördüğünüz bu siyahlıkları ben her yerde görüyorum. Ben bununla bir yere çıkarsam komik duruma düşerim. Ben bununla hiçbir yere çıkmam dedim. Yani bununla yol yürünmez. Bu böyle olmaz dedim. Hiç dikkate almadım ama Ulusal Kriminal işte traktör ile araba ayrımını yapamayan mavi ile kırmızı ayrımını yapamadığı yerde Narin’in ayrımını yapabiliyormuş. Nasıl gözleri var ise. Çok şaibeli bir yer olduğunu söyledik zaten. İtiraz da ettik. Biz o yüzden bir de zamanlama meselesi başkanım. Ona sizin müzekkerenizde biz 6 dakika biliyorduk, siz 6 dakika 45 saniye dediniz. Herhalde bunun ile ilgili bir yazı geldi.\n\n\nNarin’in Son Göründüğü Yer ve Zaman Çelişkileri ​\nŞimdi Narin’in son görüldüğü yeri biliyoruz. Okul kamerası 15:11:15’te diyor, ayrıldı. 14:00’te görüldü en son. Şeyin kriminal’in kendisinin de yaptığı çalışmaya göre 15:11:14 en son ayağının ucunun görülme. Onuncu sayfada, on ikinci sayfada ise 6 dakika 45 saniye alacağız bu kaydı. 15:18:49, 6 dakika geriye aldığımızda 15:12:04. Tam 50 saniye geçti. 50 saniye okulun önünden, yani karşısında son göründüğü yerden ahır tabir ettiği yere 50 saniye. Işınlıyor. O karartıyı, yani Narin’i duruyor orada. Drone görüntüleri de sunduk. Gazetecilerin çoğu da oraya gitti. 50 saniye, bir çocuk koşarak da çıkamaz oraya. O rampayı çıkamaz 50 saniyede. Yani nasıl çıkacak? Burada 50 saniyede ahırın önüne. Bir de evin de değil. Ahırın önüne karartı gidiyor çünkü ne için? Kamuoyunun beklediği bir şey vardı burada. Neydi? Bunlar suçlu olsun, ceza alsın diye bir durum vardı. Onlar da, hani ben iddialı bir şey söyledim, hemen dosyayı aldık, biz çözeceğiz bu işi diye hemen açıklama yaptı. Yakında herkes görecek gibi bir şey dedi, paylaştı gördük. Çok şey çözdü. Bu piksel kaymaları dediğim gibi her yerde var. Bunu dikkate alamayız. Zamansal olarak mümkün olmayan bir şey. Bize mümkün gibi yediriyor. Keşke ikinci raporu oradan aldırmasaydınız. Zaten biz itiraz ettik. Bilirkişinin reddini istemiştik. Yetişmeden rapor geldi. Önemli değil. Şey gelmedi değil mi başkanım, gezici bazlar ile ilgili?\n\n\nSalim Bey Hakkındaki Yeni Deliller ve Hukuk İlkeleri İhlali ​\nŞimdi Salim bey ile ilgili üç tane yeni somut delil çıktı. Bence çok önemli üç delil. Banka dekontu, adım sayar, bir de gece orada olduğu aracın, Onur bey dinletti aslında, o burada ne yazık ki büyük bir sessizlik olmadığı için iyi anlaşılmadı. Ben de çok iyi dinledim, adım sesleri geliyor ve alttan ya bir kız çocuğu ya da küçük bir çocuğun sesi geliyor sonlara doğru konuşmanın. 22:41’deki konuşma. Araba tam o anda, hatta haberi de yapıldı, araba o anda hareket halinde. Adım sesleri geliyor. Net. Hatta dediler ki, o konuşmayı yaptığı kişiyi aileye dinlettiğimde Hacı Kaya diye biri galiba, İstanbul’da konuşmayı yaparken yanında olan biri, hatırladı konuşmayı. Dedi ki, ben yanındaydım onun. Biz okulun önünden hemen diyor onun öncesinden okulun önünden çeşmeye doğru gidiyorduk dedi. Çok güzel dedim. Okulun kamerasına gelelim, bulacağız. Köyün o zaman köyün içerisinde Salim’in görüntüsünü okul kamerası o saatlerde alınmamış. Talep ettik, gelmedi. O saatler yok. Lehe hiçbir şey yok ama aileye ne var? İşte dediğim gibi ortaya salata yapılmış, her şey atılmış, karıştırılıyor. Bilgi kirlilikleri ile bunları açıkla. Ya şimdi biz ceza yargılamasında kişi kendi suçsuzluğunu ispat etmek zorunda. Yani yapmadığımız bir şeyi, kişiye diyoruz ki, sen bunu yaptın. Yapmadığını ispatla. Şu an, şu aşamadayız. Yapmadığınızı ispatlayın. Ya bu ceza hukukun temel prensiplerine ne kadar uyuyor? İddianameye bakıyoruz, herkes şunu söyledi; müşterek faillik. Hepimiz hukukçuyuz, hepimiz okuduğumuzu anlıyoruz. Lütfen sahip çıkalım dediğim hukuka. Buradan müşterek faillik çıkmaz çünkü hangi failin hangi fiili, hangi fiil üzerinde nasıl hakimiyet kurduğu, nasıl iştirak iradesini ortaya koyduğumuzu anlatan hiçbir cümle yok. Benim anlamadığım, diyor bir şeyler, tuhaf bir şeyler var mütalaada. Yani iddianamede, devamında mütalaada ben bunları anlayamıyorum. Bunlar bana tuhaf geliyor. Bunların demek ki bir parmağı var her şeyde. Ne şans ki bir şekilde izah edilebiliyor, bir şeyler çıkıyor. Belki daha süremiz olsa neler çıkacak ama bakın gerçekten ciddiye alınıp incelenmesi, irdelenmesi lazım. Endişe duyuyoruz çünkü korkunç bir baskı var. Kimsenin doğruyu bilip söyleme durumuna imkan verilmiyor. Hukukçular dediğim gibi çıkıyor ya da adli tıpçılar çıkıyor, doğruyu söylediğinde bir lince maruz kalıyor. İşte sen Güran’cı oldun. Toplumun böyle hemen bölmeye hazır kitle var. Niye? Çünkü insanlar bir hikaye satın aldı. Bu hikayede bu aile suçlu olacaktı. Buna oynayanlar ve bunun sayesinde çok popüler olan gazeteciler, duayen olan gazeteciler, sosyal medyada ismi, namı, şanı bilinmeyen insanlar bilinir oldu. Böyle, işte ona danışılır oldu. O konuda o söz söyleyebilir, hiç ulaşamayacağı insanlar kendisine ulaşıp fikrini alır oldu. Böyle bir anormal bir şey. 3 gün sonra isimleri unutulacak bunların çoğunun çünkü. başkanım müsaadenizle.\n\n\nDavada Rol Yapanlar ve Yeni Delillerin Reddi ​\nİnsanların bir kısmı dediğim gibi burada kendine bir rol belirledi. Buna oynadılar. Bazı hakikatleri gördüğü halde direnç kırılmasın diye başka fikirler empoze ediyorlar. Ne bunlar? Ya şimdi bir bankadan ödeme dekontu geldi. Direk kalkıyor adam bunu yalanlıyor. Bankaya nereden gitmiş? Ya iyi de bankaya gidildiğini söyleyen kim? Otomatik ödeme. Adam zaten diyor, evdeyim. Otomatik ödemedir işte, bunun ispatını mahkeme yapacaktır. Bırak sen, hemen bu böyle değildir, çünkü kendince bir bilet aldı kesinlikle bunlar suçlu olmak zorunda. Çünkü kendisi aksi halde itibarsızlaşacak. Hiç itibarı kalmayacak belki.\n\n\nRamazan Atasoy’un Tutukluluğu ve Gazetecilik ​\nNe yazık ki az önce bahsettiğim Ramazan Atasoy’un tutuklu olmasına sebep gazeteci var bu ülkede. Halen de devam ediyor gazeteciliğe. Çıkıp demiyor, ben yanlış aktardım. Bakın oradaki çevirinin fıskiye olduğunu herkes biliyor. O çocuk yanlış çeviri yüzünden tutuklu. Yanlış olduğu belgeli, dosya içerisinde duruyor. Savcılık da biliyor ama ne dedi? İşte çocuğun o fıskiyesi sana ait bir şey dendi. Çok net. Fıskiye olduğu çok net. Yine çocuğun ben dönüp bakacağım, kürtçe ben dönüp bakacağım sözü “daha ölmedi” dendi. Hatta “kız daha ölmedi” dendi. O gazeteci kız kelimesini de ekledi. Çeviride o yok. Yanlış çeviride, jandarmanın yanlış yaptığı, jandarma diyor ki, bakın ilk çeviri şey olabilir. Daha bitmedi. İkinci anlam “daha ölmedi” olabilir. Kalktı, bunu kesinlikle bağlamından da kopararak yine iddianame hazırlanırken iddianameye bazı tutanaklara dedi ki, kelimeler eklenmiş. Savcım çıkardı o kelimeleri, teşekkürler. Tutanaklara mesela Yüksel Güran kızının öldüğünden adeta emin olduğu vardı ya, o kısımlar kesin olarak emin olduğu gibi bir şeyler vardı, siz çıkarmışsınız. Tutanakta olmayan, tutanağa da eklenen kelimeler vardı. Böyle çok şey var da, şimdi bunu gördük. Ya 14 yaşında bir çocuk en azından onun için, Güran’lar için bu çocuğun Güran’lar ile ilgisi yok. Biz de avukatı değiliz ama görüyorum vicdanım sızlıyor. Sırf yanlış çeviri yüzünden bir işçi, gariban bir çocuk hala tutuklu. Çocuk ya bu. Çocuk çocuk. İlk gün geldi buraya, korkusunu gözlerinden hepimiz gördük. AGO’da dedi, ben bir şey biliyor olsam zaten söylerim ama dediğim gibi temas kurmuşsa bu insanlar ile tutuklanabilir, en ağır cezayı alabilir algısı var. İnsanlardan çünkü niye onu işine yani Salim’i koruyabilecek bir cümle kurmuş, nasıl kurabilir? Onu da kurmamalı, suçlamalı. Bu sayede Salim ceza almalı. Herkesin algısı, bakış açısı buydu. Çocuk hala rehine bence. Ya bizim dosyamız niye açılmıyor? Niye birlikte gitmiyor? Bu kadar süre vardı, toplanan hiçbir delil yok. Hiçbir işlem yapılmıyor. Biz talepte bulunuyoruz, bizim taleplerimiz işleme dahi sokulmuyor. Böyle bir şey olabilir mi? Böyle bir şey olabilir mi? Ne yapalım, yani biz çıkıp medyaya çıkmayalım ya da sahaya çıkmayalım, artık elimizden gelen hiçbir şey kalmadı. Dediğim gibi bir dizayn yaratıldı. En azından bunu kırabilir miyiz, nasıl kıralım. Onu da söyleyeyim, doğru belgeleri verelim, insanlara anlatım evraklar üzerinden, bak böyle böyle değil.\n\n\nHalılardaki DNA ve Jandarmanın İşlemleri ​\nHalı dendi, işte halılarda DNA var. Ben söyleyeyim, ne kadar sağlıklı yapıldı o incelemeler acaba? Jandarmanın yaptığı hangi işlem sağlıklı ki? Ben iddia ediyorum, o da sağlıksız, düzgün yapılmamıştır. Halılarda kıl da vardır başka şeyler de vardır. Sadece mavi ışıkla baktılar, kan ya da ölüm sıvısı gibi bir şey aradıkları için, başka DNA yok. Onlar bir şeye sarıldılar, bir ihtimale sarıldılar. Eğer kız burada, şeyin dediği gibi, ağzından ölüm sıvısı geldiyse bu şekilde inceleme yapıldı dediler ama var DNA. Başka DNA’lar var. Ben iddia ediyorum olandan da başka var. Yok halılar yıkandı, işte ondan dolayı hiç bir şey yok. Nasıl oluyor? Hiç DNA yok? Peki bunu basına kim söyledi? Yine jandarma. İddia ediyorum söyledi. Dedi ki, böyle bir şey var. Şimdi yok diyecek, soruşturma aşamasında, savcılık sızdırmadı. CMK avukatları Nahit başkan anlatıyor. Hepsini tembihledi. Bütün şeylere işaret kondu. Bizim Diyarbakır Barosu avukatlarından da sızmadı, kimden sızdı o zaman ya? Unutmayalım Yüksel hanım sorgudayken eli kelepçeli fotoğrafı bile var. Hakim karşısına eli kelepçeli çıkmış var. Fotoğrafı var, basında var. Daha ne anlatalım? Kime ne diyelim? Günlerce saatlerce bunları anlatıyoruz. Bunları anlatmaya çalışıyoruz ama işe yaramıyor.\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar’ın Ev Tarifi Çelişkileri ve Yanlış Yorumlar ​\nEvin fotoğrafları var bizde. Biz kendisine sorduk. Hangi odaya girdin? ilk şeyde sol dedi. Sol dedi ama odada ne var bilmiyorum dedi. Biz görüntüleri sunduk. Bilirkişi daraltılmış bazda boş oda diyor. Boş oda diye bir şey yok. Evde bütün odalar dolu. Jandarma da biliyor. Bir kısmının fotoğrafları da var. Boş oda neresi acaba? Neresi? ben söylüyorum. Yanlış bir olasılık hesabı dedik. Ya yanlış bir olasılık hesabı ile gidiliyor. Nevzat Bahtiyar çıktı, kızı aldı. Kendi ahırına koydu. Bu bölgeyi, hani dün Fatih’in gösterdiği o bölgesel şey var ya, bunu istediğimiz gibi yorumlayabiliriz. Evet üçgenlemede o bölgede bir yer görünüyordur, onu istediği gibi yorumlayabilecekti. Müşterek faillikten tamam sonuçta düşünün şimdi bir anneyi almışsınız, tutuklamışsınız. Sonrasında herhalde pardon demek de kolay değildir. Somut güçlü bir delil ama şu gerekirdi, öyle güçlü deliller olmalıydı ki. Ya biz de şunu demeliydik, tamam sonuçta da bir şey var ortada ama yok, dosyada yok.\n\n\nToplum Algısı ve Hukuksuz Kararların Tarihsel Örnekleri ​\nAma ne yazık ki şu oldu. İnsanlarda algıda ya tutuklanmışsa bir şeyi vardır. İnsanlar böyle baktı. Bir şey yoksa da tutuklanmaz. Her halde sebep sonuç burada olması gerekenin dışında oldu. Ne yazık ki biri tutukluysa suçla ilişkisi var dendi. Halbuki öyle değil ki. Bakın dosyaya dosyayı görüyoruz. Dediğim gibi bütün delillere tek tek baktık. Anne ile ilgili zaten mütalaada Yılmaz bey, hatta paylaştı savcım dedi, bu etik değil. Ya etik değil tartışılır, ben de hani direk etiktir diyemem meslektaşımı koruma adına ama bu dosya dediğim gibi algılar ile yürüyor ne yazık ki. Algılar ile yürüdüğü için normal standart rutin gibi şeyler gibi bakmayalım. Önce bir insanların bir şeyi sindirmesi lazım. Bir çok dünyada bir çok ülkede hukuksuz kararlar verildi daha önce. Central Park olayını biliyoruz. NewYork’ta yaşanan zenci çocukların hiç ilgisi olmadığı, toplum üzerinde linç algısı yaratıldı. Hatta şu an dönemin amerikan başkanı Donald Trump’ın bir idam kampanyası başlattı. Bu konuda ciddi bir para harcadı. Bir şey var biliyorsunuz o çocukların sonra masum olduğu anlaşıldı. DNA ile itirafçı kendi suçunu itiraf ediyor. Yine Fransa’da benzer bir gölde bulunan bir kadın var. Ondan dolayı aile suçlanıyor. İntihar vakaları yaşandı. Onun için diyorum, burada çok büyük bir karara bugün mü olur, yarın mı olur, artık bilmiyorum, bir karar verilecek. Bütün, inşallah bakalım, bütün Türkiye’nin takip ettiği, tarihe damga olarak geçecek bir şey olacak.\n\n\nEnes Güran için Beraat Talebi ​\nBen bu davada, bakın şunu söyleyebilirim. Ben kendi müvekkillerimi savunmaktan, bu davada olmaktan gerçekten kendim adına gurur duyuyorum. İnşallah yeterince layığıyla yerine getirebildim. Son olarak dosyada, evet, anlatabileceğimiz çok şey var. Kısmen yazılı sunduk. Saha önce, geçen celsede anlattık. Tekrara artık düşmeyeyim. Meslektaşlarım da anlatacak. Sizi de çok yordum yani. Teşekkür ederim sabırla dinlediğiniz için. Yargılama sürecindeki sabrınız için ayrıca teşekkür ederim. Tüm dosya kül halinde değerlendirildiğinde, müvekkilim Enes Güran’ı suçlamaya yetecek hiçbir delil yoktur. Şüpheden sanık yararlanır ilkesince, herhalde olacaktır, çünkü çok şüphe yaratıldı ne yazık ki, bir de bu dosyada şüpheli enflasyonu diye bir de bir gazeteci, saygın gazetecimiz bir laf söyledi. Gerçekten çok güzel bir laf. Şüpheli enflasyonu yaşandı bu dosyada. Herkes şüpheli oldu. Müvekkilin şüpheden sanık yararlanır ilkesince beraatına karar verilmesini talep ediyorum.",

    "text": "Av. Recep KIZILOK ​\n\nGiriş Beyanı ve Genel İtirazı ​\nBen fazla konuşmayacağım. Meslektaşlarım zaten her şeyi anlattı. İddia makamının esasa ilişkin mütalaasına iştirak etmiyoruz. Meslektaşlarımız zaten ayrıntılı bir şekilde anlattı. Hukuk sisteminin amacı, maddi gerçekleri şüpheye yer vermeyecek şekilde bulmayı amaçlar. İddia makamındaki mütalaada somut delil yoktur. Varsa yorumlara dayalı olduğunu düşünüyorum. Mütalaayı genel olarak bir değerlendireceğim.\n\n\nMuhammed Kaya’nın Terlik Meselesi ​\nŞimdi Muhammed Kaya’nın terlik meselesi. Muhammed Kaya bir terlik buluyor, aracına koyuyor. Daha sonra Osman Güran bunun Narin’in olabileceğini düşünerek aileye, daha sonra kolluk birimlerine bildiriyor. Bunun Narin’in olmadığı ortaya çıkınca kolluk birimlerini farklı bir yere yanlış yönlendirilmelerine dair gerekçelendirme yapıyorlar. Sizce kolluk birimleri nasıl yanlış yönlendirilebilir? Yani bunu ben düşünüyorum da, yanlış yönlendirecek bir şey söz konusu değil. Maddi bir gerçekle ilişkili bir şey de söz konusu değil. Bu sebeple çok dikkate alınacak bir şey de değil. Zaten müvekkilime de isnat edilen bir durum söz konusu da değil.\n\n\nElektrik Telleri ve Yangın İddiası ​\nİkinci husus elektrik telleri. Elektrik tellerinin birbirine çarpması sonucu yangın meydana geliyor. Bunu organize bir şekilde ailenin yaptığını, suçluyu kayırmak amacıyla yapıldığı gerekçelendiriliyor. Ya bunu özellikle belirtmek istiyorum. Jandarma dereye gidip de Narin’in naaşını bulmak üzereyken aile bulmasın diye köyü mü yakmaya karar verdi acaba? Yani mantıklı düşündüğünüzde benim kafam almıyor. Yani bu durumlar nasıl bu suçla ilişkilendiriliyor? Yani tamamen varsayım, yorum, hayal gücü diye düşünüyorum.\n\n\nNarin’in Kaybolduğu Köy ve Akrabalık Bağları ​\nYani bu durumda üçüncü husus Narin’in kaybolduğu köyde çoğu kişinin akraba olması, yabancı şahısların araçlarının girmemesi, eve çok çok yakın bir yerde kaybolması olayı ailenin yaptığını ve ailenin organize bir şekilde sakladığını mütalaada görüyoruz. Yani gerçekten düşündüğümüzde maddi gerçeği biz bir hukukçu olarak somut verilerle ortaya koymamız gerekiyor. Varsayım ve yorumlarla değil. Yani burada tamamen varsayım ve yorum var. Maddi bir gerçeklik yok. Aile kavramı da anne baba ve kardeştir. Burada aile kimden kastediliyor? Bunu da düşünmemiz gerekiyor.\n\n\nEnes’in Gözündeki Morluk ve Isırık İzi ​\nMüvekkilim Enes’in gözündeki morluk ve bir de ısırık izi. Bu konu çok konuşuldu. Belki burada şu an yargılanmasına sebep olan durumlardan biri de adli tıp raporu. Aleyhe olan bir husus yok. Önceki celse birden fazla tanık dinleniyor ve bu tanıklardan olay günü Enes’in diş izi, gözündeki morlukla ilgili bir şey görmediğini beyan ediyorlar. Yani isnat, suç yok ortada ve buna rağmen bir senaryo geliştiriliyor. Ve Bunun ile ilgili müvekkilim suçlanıyor.\n\n\nMüvekkilin Beyanları ve Tahliye Talebi ​\nMüvekkilimin gerek kollukta gerekse adli makamlarda verdiği beyanlar gayet samimi ve gerçekçi beyanlardır. Saat konusunda yanılgıya düşmesi gayet normal. Meslektaşım bir fotoğraf gösterdi. Yani o an düştüğünü gördünüz ya, o psikolojide olan bir insan saat konusunda da hata yapabilir, bir şeyleri de unutabilir. Normal bir durum söz konusu olduğunu düşünüyorum. Bu sebeple müvekkilime isnat edilen suçlardan somut delil yoktur. Hepsi varsayımdır. Uzun süredir tutukludur. Müvekkilim kız kardeşinin naaşını mezarını bile görmedi yani. Özellikle tutuksuz yargılanmasını, bu aşamada eğer mahkemeniz aksi kanaatte ise bir veya birden fazla adli kontrol şartıyla serbest bırakılmasını, iddia makamı mütalaasından ise beraatını, mahkemeniz aksi kanaate ise lehe olan hükümler uygulanmasını talep ediyorum.",

    "text": "Av. Yılmaz DEMİROĞLU ​\n\nSavunmanın Amacı ve Yargı İlkesi ​\nSayın başkan, değerli üyeler, geçen celsede belirttiğimiz üzere biz avukatlar olarak burada her ne kadar savunma tarafında yer alıyorsak da Narin’imizin annesinin avukatı olarak buradayız. Dolayısıyla öncelikli amacımız adalete hizmet etmek ve maddi hakikâtin, somut delillerin ortaya çıkmasına hizmet etmektir. Yegane amacımız budur, Narin’in gerçek katilinin veya katillerinin cezasız kalmasına asla savunma olarak bizim de vicdanımız el vermiyor. Bugüne kadar bu dava dosyası üzerinden çok sayıda senaryolar üretildi. Tamamen dayanaksız, temelden yoksun delilsiz senaryolar üretildi. Bunun farkındayız ve eminim ki bu senaryoyu üretenler somut delilleri gördüğü zaman maalesef gerçek yüzlerine vura vura açık olmasına rağmen bu gerçeğin, bu hakikatin ortaya çıkmasını ve yanılmış olmayı hazmedemeyen ciddi kesim vardır. Biz dava dosyasında bazı deliller elde ettiğimizde, bunu gördüğümüzde yine bazı basın yayın organlarında sosyal medyalarda bu delillerin küçümsenmeye çalışıldığını, itibarsızlaştırılmayı üzülerek gördük. Burada tek amacımız, ve emin olun ben de bir avukat olarak günün sonunda evet bende korkuyorum bir çocuk katilinin avukatı olarak günün sonunda anılmak istemem. Evet, savunma kutsaldır, doğrudur, ama bu dosyanın bulunduğu nokta itibariyle biz bu dosyayı savunma ekibi olarak üstlendiğimizde üzerinde şüphe olabilecek kişileri özellikle seçmedik, adalete hizmet etmeye çalıştık ve bu yolda ilerleme çalışıyoruz. Sayın başkanım 1970 yıllarda verilen bir Yargıtay kararı vardı. Orada bir söz, gerçekten hukuka yardım etmek istediğim zaman, o sözü hiçbir zaman unutmuyorum; bu benim aynı zamanda bir ilkemdir. Orada der ki, Hakim tabiata, olağana, gerçeğe uygun bir şekilde katı kalp, katı kalıplar içerisine sıkışıp kalmadan uyuşmazlığı insan kokusu taşıyan bir çözüm gerektirmek zorundadır. Yani biz burada bir değerlendirme yaparken bir senaryo üretirken akıl, mantık, bilim, vicdan bunları bir kenara bırakamayız. Maddi hakikata ulaştığımız zaman, ulaşmaya çalıştığımız zaman biz bu hayatın olağan seyrini, anlattığımız çelişkilerini elbette gözeteceğiz. Bizlerde akıl sahibiyiz ama bugün bu dava dosyasında biz şunu gördük; bir toplumsal cinnet hali var, maalesef var.\n\n\nMasumiyet Karinesi ve Medya Etiği İhlalleri ​\nBu cinnet hali içerisinde masumlar insanlar henüz dava dosyası açılmadan iddianame hazırlanmadan maalesef lekelenmeme hakkı, masumiyet karinesi dediğimiz şey ihlal edildi. Biz bunları gördük. Bazı yayın organları bu sorumluluğu, yani kendi sorumluluklarını yerine getiremedi. Boy boy müvekkillerin fotoğraflarına yer verilmek suretiyle, bazı senaryolar uydurulmak suretiyle insanlar hakkında kesin hüküm verilircesine hüküm kuruldu. Mahkemenize talimat verilmeye çalışıldı. Bu yolla, şimdi bu bizim açımızdan niye önemlidir? Çünkü biz aynı zamanda annenin avukatıyız ve bu süreç adil yargılanma beklentisi olan sanıklar nezdinde, yani tüm sanıklar nezdinde, burada Nevzat’ı ayırmıyorum, tüm sanıklar yönünden endişeye yol açıyor. Görülmekte olan bir dava ile ilgili basın yayın ilkelerinden biri olarak kişilerin masumiyet karinesinin ihlal edilmemesi ve mahkemeye yani mahkemeyi etkileyecek veya kişi hakkında hüküm kuracak nitelikte beyanlardan kaçınmayı bize hukuki bir ödev olarak bir vatandaş ödevi olarak da sunuyor. Ama biz bu dosyada, bu dosya ile ilgili yapılan yayınlarda biz bunu göremedik. Şimdi biz savunma avukatı olarak, Narin kızımız evet vahşice katledildi. Savunma avukatı olarak halen biz annenin konumunu öğrenemedik. Sayın adalet bakanımız dedi ki; “Narin kızımızın katledilmesi ile ilgili karanlıkta hiçbir nokta kalmayacak”. Bu sözü verdi. Bütün Türkiye’ye verdi evet, biz de yargının kurucu unsuru olarak kendisine hizmet etme ve bu sözün adalete hizmet etme açısından üzerimize düşeni yapıyoruz, yapmaya da devem edeceğiz. Şimdi sunulan iddianamede bir kesit alarak ben anneye yöneltilen suçlamayla ilgili hukukçuların takdirine bir durum sundum. Ancak sayın iddia makamı bu durumu eleştirdi. Ben tekrar buradan söylüyorum; bugün anneye yöneltilen suçlamayı bütün dünyaya da duyuracağım, annenin hakkını koruyacağım. Yöneltilen suçlama bir jandarmanın niyet okumasına yönelik tutanaktır. Biz iddianame hazırlanırken veya mütalaa hazırlanırken ceza muhakemesinin 170/d maddesi özellikle belirtiliyor. Dolayısıyla mütalaada bulunması gereken önemli hususlardan birisi de yüklenen suçun oluşturduğu olaylar mevcut deliller ile ilişkilendirilerek açıklanır.\n\n\nAnneye Yönelik Suçlamaların Delilsizliği ve Soruşturma Eksiklikleri ​\nŞimdi bu dava dosyasında mevcut deliller ile anneyi hangi noktayakoyacağız? Bunu nasıl ilişkilendiriyorsunuz? Anne, birinci soru eski deyimle fiili irtikap eden, yani suçun asli maddi faili midir? Kızını mı boğdu? Tabiatına aykırı bir iddia mı ileri sürüyorsunuz ya da yok oğlu bu eylemi gerçekleştirdi de oğlunu mu koruyor diyorsunuz? Bunu da anlamadık ya da yok Salim bu eylemi gerçekleştirdi de Salim’i mi koruyor, Nevzat’ı mı koruyor? Susmak, mekan. Bir mekan seçilmiş, susmak adeta suça ortak olma şeklinde ileri sürülmüştür. Biz hiçbir zaman anneyle defalarca görüşmeme rağmen, Narin kızımız anne için ayrı biriydi. Kızı Tülin maalesef engelli doğdu. Engelli bir kızı 7 yaşına kadar, 8 yaşına kadar bütün annelik benliği ile sırtında taşıyarak baktı ama bu anneye bu kızına güzel elbiseler giydiremedi. İzin verilmedi, giydiremedi. Daha sonra bu kızı hastalık nedeniyle vefat etti. Allah’tan içinde uhde kalan saçlarını tarayacağı, güzel elbiseler giyeceği ve kendisiyle oynayacağı bir kız çocuğu olması için dua etti ve Allah’ın lütfu olan biricik Narin’i maalesef alçak bir el katletti. Sayın başkanım, biz bu eleştiriyi yaparken basın bundan sonra benzer olaylarla ilgili elbette fikrini hür beyan eder, kimse kısıtlanamaz ancak asgari ilkelere uyulması gerektiği. Yani ileride daha vahim sonuçların, daha vahim adaletsizliklerin ortaya çıkmaması için bu beklentimiz devam edecek. Başkaları için de devam edecektir. Sizin mahkeme heyetiniz üzerinde de töhmet oluşuyor bu yollarla. Neden biz savunma avukatı olarak odalarda başka yerlerde duyuyoruz ya! Zaten karar verilmiş, motivasyonumuzu düşürmeye çalışanlar adalet arayışlarımızı düşürenler oldu. Biz bunları asla hukuka sığdırmadık, bunları es geçtik. Bugün sayın başkanım bu dava dosyasında 4 sanığın huzurda bulunmasının tek nedeni kolluğun maalesef soruşturma aşamasında savcılığın elinde uzmanlaşmış bir adli kolluğun bulunmamasının sıkıntısını yaşıyoruz. Eğer ki, adli kolluk bağımsız bir kolluk olsaydı, bu sıkıntıyı asla yaşamayacaktık. Bugün 4 sanığın burada, yani ayıklanmış vaziyette, huzurunuza çıkacağına inancım var. Burada ne yapıldı? İlk ihbar daima önemlidir, biz bunu biliyoruz.\n\n\nİlk İhbar ve Jandarma Soruşturmasındaki Hatalar ​\nİlk ihbarda aile fertlerinden Baran’dan gitmemiş; aslında kayıp vakası ile ilgili ilk ihbar jandarma personeli ile görüşen Salim Güran’dan gitmiş ve kızın saati 15:00 ve 15:30 olarak belirtilmiştir. Bu görüşme kayıtlarında mevcuttur ve bunu biz görüyoruz, dinlediğimizde anlıyoruz. Yine bu ihbar içeriğinde, devam eden ihbar içeriğinde şüphelenilen çingenelerden bahsedildiği, arkadan gelen bir sesin de köylülerden gelen bir sesin de kırmızı araçtan bahsettiği aşikardır. Şimdi biz jandarma personeli ile bu görüşmeyi yaptığımız zaman böyle bir bilgi gittiği zaman en azından bir tutanak tutulmaz mı? Eğer Salim Güran’ın bu ses kaydı geri gelmeseydi, bu tutanakta olmayacaktı. Jandarma biliyor da başka tutanakları tutmayı, böyle kritik bir noktada tutanak tutmayı neden bilmiyor? Neden kırmızı araç ile ilgili bir tutanak tutulmadı? Neden bu kırmızı araçla ilgili herhangi bir kamera araştırması yapmadı? Bu sorular var. Kanaatimce bu kusurun, eksikliğin faturasının biz bugün aileye kesildiğini öğreniyoruz. Narin’imize geç ulaşılmasının sorumluluğu, kusuru ailede değildir. Narin’imizin kaybolduğu yer olarak tarif edilen jandarma tutanağının tarif ettiği tutanak gerçekten ilginçtir. Bu tutanakta Narin’in son görüldüğü yerin Hüseyin Güran’ın evi, kendi ikameti ve Salim Güran’ın ikameti işte Fuat Güran’ın ikameti çevresinde yani kendi çevresinde kaybolduğuna dair tutanak tutuluyor. Oysa biz okul kamera kayıtlarında görüyoruz ki, son kayıp yeri ve kayıp saati 15:11. Hemen Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın evinin yanındaki patika yol. Profesyonel bir kolluğun yapması gereken derhal bu alanı abluka altına almak ve delil araştırması yapmasıydı, ama bu eksiklik yapılmadı. Yine aynı görüşmede olay mahallini gösteren kameranın olduğu söylenmesine rağmen buna dair de maalesef dönen kamera ile ilgili kaydın alınmadığını biz görüyoruz. Şimdi bunun Narin’imize geç ulaşılmasının kusuru devletin saygınlığına bir gölge düşürmeyecektir. Kimileri, bunu acaba devlet saygınlığı mı sarsıldı, biz buna bir bahane bulmalıyız anlayışı ile mi hareket etti? Biz bu kusurun faturasını devlete aileye ödetmeyeceğiz. Devletin saygınlığı adil davranmakla geçer, hukuka saygılı olmakla hukuka uygun davranmakla ancak adalet ile devletin saygınlığı olur.\n\n\nAdalet Çağrısı ve Yargı Bağımsızlığı Vurgusu ​\nDolayısıyla burada bir eğer ki başka vicdanları yaralayacak, hukuku yaralayacak bir karar verilirse hiçbir şekilde maddi delil olmaksızın insanlar eğer ki mahkumiyet ile karşılaşırsa işte o zaman adalet duygusu rencide olur, sarsılır. Biz buna inanıyoruz. Biz hukukçu olarak asla ve katiyen başka algılar ile hareket etmiyoruz ve toplumda oluşan inanca göre veya toplumdaki kanaatlere göre ileri sürülen kanaatlere göre ya da yayınlarda işlenen delil durumuna göre biz bunlardan etkilenerek bir hüküm vermeyeceğine inanıyoruz. Sizler hukukçu olarak hiçbir baskı altında kalmadan ve yargı bağımsızlığının da bugün vereceğiniz kararda ne kadar önemli olacağını bizler günün sonunda öğrenmiş bulunacağız. Sizler sabırla üç gündür savunma hakkına gerçekten sabrederek, savunma hakkını gölgelemeyerek bizleri dinliyorsunuz. Biz bu sabrınızdan ötürü teşekkür ediyoruz ve diğer meslektaşlarımın girdiği konular ile ilgili herhangi bir tekrara girmeden veya önemli gördüğüm hususlarda özet geçmeye çalışacağım. Sizin de bugün toplumun beklediği, ülkenin beklediği, nihayetinde kararı açıklamanıza hizmet adına savunmamı özet özet geçmeye çalışacağım sayın başkan.\n\n\nDaraltılmış Baz Raporunun Güvenilmezliği ​\nSayın başkan şimdi iddianamede ve mütalaada suçlamanın dayanağı olarak gösterilen, yegane delil diye tabir edilen daraltılmış baz raporu olduğu gözden kaçmamaktadır. Bizler daraltılmış baz ile ilgili bu raporu gördüğümüzde gerekli işin uzmanlarından görüş almaya çalıştık, araştırdık. Ancak yani burada da tuhaf bir durum ile karşılaştık. Hiç kimse aklımız ile dalga geçmesin, hiç kimse ülkeyi kandırmasın. Daraltılmış baz diye önümüze konulan raporda oda oda kişilerin konumunun tespiti asla ve asla mümkün değildir, asla ve asla mümkün değildir sayın başkanım. Sayın başkanım, daraltılmış bazı biz savunma avukatı olarak nasıl çürütebiliriz diye, yani bu garabetten nasıl kurtulabiliriz diye çırpındık. Mustafa bey öğleden önceki savunmasında adım sayar ile ilgili durumu izah etti. Gerçekten de biz adım sayarın bu daraltılmış bazda bahsedilen hareketleri ile karşılayıp karşılayacağını denetleme açısından çok önemli bir delil olduğunu düşünerek mahkeme heyetinize başvurduk. Heyetinize emanette bulunan adım sayarı getirdi, hatta ben meslektaşım ile bir espri de yaptık. Ya dedik ki, biz böyle korkuyoruz şimdi açacaklar ya upuzun bir grafik çıkarsa ne yapacağız? Öyle olmadı. Nihayetinde çünkü biz emindik. Yani emindik çünkü aldığımız bilgiye göre gerçekten Salim’in de olay günü Salim’in ailesinin verdiği beyanlardan da anlaşıldığı üzere olay günü o saatlerde kritik saatlerde evinde olduğunu biliyoruz. Şimdi adım sayarın bu yönüyle önemli bir özellik arz ettiğini ve daraltılmış baz raporunu tamamen çürüttüğünü biz gördük çünkü daraltılmış baz raporunda Salim’in Arif’in evine gidişini bir tarafa bırakalım oraları hiç saymayalım; sadece Arif’in evinde ahıra geçiş, ahırdan eve geçiş şeklinde yapılan değerlendirmeleri bile sadece esas alsak bile bunun 100-150 adımdan daha fazla olduğunu gördük, gözlemledik. Dolayısıyla daraltılmış bazın kesinlikle gerçekçi olmadığını gördük. Daha sonra biz uzmanlardan öğrendiğimiz kadarıyla meğer geçmişe dönük baz sinyal gücünün tespiti dahi mümkün değildir.\n\n\nBaz Sinyal Bilgilerinin Güvenilirliği ve Sanık Beyanları ​\nYani siz 21’de gerçekleşen bir olayla ilgili 28 ve 29’da yaptığınız ölçüm ya da 29 ve 30’da yaptığınız bir ölçüm veya 8-9’da yaptığınız bir ölçümle 21’in ölçümünü asla yakalayamazsınız çünkü baz sinyal bilgileri, burası karıştırılmasın bizim bahsettiğimiz HTS kayıtlarında gördüğümüz bazlar değil, ana bazlar değil, sinyal gücü ile ilgili bir durum; eski sinyal gücünü yakalamanız asla mümkün değildir. O anki şartlardaki hava durumu, o anki şartlardaki kişilerin görüştüğü o bazdan aldığı görüşme sayısı, her şeyi, sinyali etkileyebiliyor. Telefon kalitesi daha markası dahi bu sinyali etkileyebilecek güçtedir. Dolayısıyla hiçbir zaman noktasal olarak bu daraltılmış bazın doğru bir veri sunmayacağını biz biliyoruz. Hiçbir ceza dosyasında da böyle bir delil kesin delilmiş gibi önümüze konulmamalı diye düşünüyorum. Şimdi biz daraltılmış bazı incelerken aynı zamanda sanık Nevzat’ın beyanlarını da çakıştırmaya çalışıyoruz. Yani bizim dikkatimizi çeken kendisinin belirttiği, özellikle mesela tepeden seslenme, kendisinin işte ahıra gitmesi vesaire bu tarz hareketlerinin olmadığını görüyoruz. Yani aslında kendi beyanı ile de pek örtüşen ana noktalarda örtüşen hususların olmadığını görüyoruz. Bu nedenle, sayın başkanım özellikle Yargıtay kararları var mı yok mu, bizler bunu da araştırdık. Hani pek olmadığını söyleyen meslektaşlarımız da oldu. Daraltılmış bazın yeni bir durum olmadığını, evet buna benzer Jandarma grafikleri ölçümleri bazen oluyor ki bizim dosyamızda da var, aslında mantıklı olan o tarz çalışma; yani kişilerin açılarını yakın mı değil mi aynı açıdan baz alıp almadığına ilişkin bir değerlendirme yapmak belki daha gerçekçi ama hiçbir zaman noktasal olarak yapmak gerçekçi değil. Kişilerin anlık takibinde, yani iletişimin tespiti suretiyle, hakimin alacağı karar yani canlı olarak takipte sinyal bilgilerinin değerlendirilmesi durumunda dahi telefonun bulunduğu noktanın tam olarak o anki canlı verilere rağmen tespitinin mümkün olmadığını belli bir çevre ile ancak bunun mümkün olabileceğini görüyoruz. Yine bazı bu olaylar ile ilgili gezici istasyonların bulunduğunu biz medyadan biliyoruz. Kaliteli yayınlar yapılması, iletişimin sağlanması, olaydan sonra sağlanması için orada gezici bazların kurulduğunu biliyoruz.\n\n\nHTS Kayıtları ve Nevzat’ın Çelişkili İlk Beyanları ​\nDolayısıyla bu baz ile ilgili, biz bunun hükme esas alınamayacağını düşünüyoruz. Burada bir beklentimiz de var sayın heyetinizden. Bazlar ile ilgili, evet yani HTS kaydında görünen bazlar ile ilgili yan delil olarak yargı uygulamalarında kullanıldığını biliyoruz. Şimdi orada bile Yargıtay Ceza Genel Kurulu’nun kararı var. Diyor ki, HTS bazları ile ilgili, yani aynı bazdan görüşmeleri, kişilerin evleri, iş yerleri, konumları birbirine yakın olan kişilerin bir araya geldiğine delil olamayacağına, bu bazların delil olamayacağına dair Yargıtay Ceza Genel Kurulu’nun kararı mevcuttur. Biz ilk itiraz dilekçemizde sayın mahkemenizden bunun künyesini de paylaşmış bulunuyoruz ki muhtemelen zaten heyetiniz benzer kararlardan haberdardır. Zaten o nedenle bu dava dosyasının çözümü için bazdan ziyade maddi delillere yoğunlaşarak bir çözüm geliştirileceği kanaatindeyiz. Şimdi yargı uygulamalarında biz beyanları değerlendirirken elimizde Nevzat’ın beyanları var. Beyan delilini biz değerlendirirken bu beyanların çelişkili olup olmadığını, akla mantığa uygun olup olmadığını değerlendirmek zorundayız. Dolayısıyla hayatın olağan akışına aykırı beyanlar akla mantığa aykırı veya kendisinin işlediği bir suçu örtmeye yönelik masum kişilere atfı cürüm mahiyetindeki beyanlar ceza dosyamızda karşımıza çıkıyor. Bu beyanları hukuk süzgecinde hayatın olağan akışı süzgecinden geçirip gerçekçi olup olmadığını, beyana üstünlük tanıyıp tanımayacağını bizler hukukçular olarak değerlendiriyoruz. Ancak Nevzat’ın beyanlarında asla bir üstünlük tanınamaz. Neden sayın başkanım? Diğer meslektaşlarım da ifade etti; Nevzat 8 Eylül 2024 tarihinde aracının Eğertutmaz deresinde tespitinden sonra yakalanıp ifadesine başvurulmuş, ilk ifadelerinde, alınan ilk beyanlarında okulun alt tarafındaki parke yolda, mezarlığa giden yolda, işte Salim’in kendisini durdurduğunu orada araçların içerisinde bir transfer gerçekleştirdiğini, daha doğrusu cansız bedeni bu cansız bedenin battaniye içerisinde sarılı vaziyette kendisine teslim edildiğini, kendisine de işaret edilerek hatta parmağını göstererek “Götürüp oraya Eğertutmaz deresine gömeceksin”. İlk beyanı bu. Beraber diyor. Aracın bagajındaki çuvala koyduk.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Beyanlarındaki Tutarsızlıklar ve Detaylı Çelişkiler ​\nÇuvalı da ben arka, kendi aracımın arka paspasımızın üzerine koydum, o şekilde götürdüm. Buradaki beyan ilk beyanlarda teslim yeri olarak köy çıkışı belirtiliyor. Sonra beyan değişikliğine gidiliyor. Diyor ki, ben diyor aslında geri geri geldim. Yani o çuval, muhtemelen kafasında çuval var çünkü cansız bedene ulaşınca bu çuvalın kendisine ait olabileceğini bu çuvalın da ahırdan gittiğini evinden gittiğini düşünen sanık, bu sefer bir savunma refleksi göstererek, ben burada bir hata yaptım köy dışında bir yerden aldığımı söyledim ama benim geri geri gitmem lazım, ne yapmam lazım, işte geri geri gittim inşaat malzemelerinde kullandığım çuvalı boşalttım kendi ikametimde, işte çuvala koydum o çuvalı da götürüp araca koydum götürdüm diyor. Sekiz farklı beyanı var da ben temel olan beyanlarını söylüyorum. Şimdi burada da akla mantığa uymayan bir durum söz konusu. Yani sen cesedi teslim almışsın, tekrar geri geri gideceksin, ikametinde köyün içerisine oralarda birilerinin görme ihtimali var, bu hiç bana mantıklı gelmiyor. Sonra her ne olduysa sayın başkanım bu sefer beyan değiştirerek Salim beni tepeden çağırdı, gel dedi, pardon senin ile işim var beni bekle, ben geleceğim. Geldiği aracı ile benim ahırımın önünde cesedi bana teslim etti gitti. Ben gittim, battaniyeyi de Salim’e verdim, teslim ile ilgili üçüncü beyan. Sonra aşama aşama Salim beni tepeden çağırdı, ben gittim Arif’in evine, orada kimse yoktu. Orada bütün kapılar kapalıydı, yerde yatar vaziyette ağzından köpük gelecek şekilde Narin’i aldığını, kapıdaki terlikleri de aldığını, battaniyeye sardığını, götürüp o meydanda o tepede kucağında taşıyıp kendi ahırına götürdüğünü, yani ahırın camından bacasından aşağıya attığını, burada duruşmada ifade etmesine rağmen ben savunmamda o sırada dedim ki, bu baca olmayabilir çünkü baca olsaydı vücutta kırıklar olurdu 3 metre aşağı olsa vücutta ciddi kırıklar olurdu mantığa uymadı. Sonra geldi dedi, hayır o baca değil, ben yan tarafta götürdüm. Doğru söylüyor, yan taraftan götürmüş aslında ama ne şekil götürmüş? Burada da akla mantığa ziyan şeyler var. Sayın heyetiniz, sayın başkanım siz özellikle sordunuz dediniz ki, odaları tarif et. Sağa mı gittin, sola mı gittin, dikine mi gittin, nereye gittin?\n\n\nNevzat’ın Anlatımlarındaki Tutarsızlıkların Devamı ve Saik Tartışması ​\nYok bilmiyorum, nereden teslim aldığını bilmiyorum. Biz bunun önemli olacağını düşünerek mahkemenizden bir keşif talebinde bulunduk. Ancak mahkemeniz muhtemelen başka delillere bakmıştır ki, keşif talebimizi kabul etmedi. Şimdi orada biz bir televizyon programında canlandırma yapıldı. Canlandırmada eve giden iki ana kapının olduğunu, bir kapının da içten ancak açılabileceğini gördük. Yani dıştan açılması mümkün değildir. İçten açılabileceğini gördük. Dolayısıyla bu beyanın da akıl ve mantık süzgecinden geçirildiğinde hiçbir şekilde tutarlı bir tarafının olmadığını görüyoruz. Peki, Narin’imiz nasıl katledildi? Nevzat neden böyle davranıyor? Sayın başkanım, biz Türk-Kürt toplumu Türk milletinde asla kadına çocuğa yönelik, iffetine yönelik özellikle onları hedef alacak bir mentalitemiz yoktur. Ne düşmanlıklar görüldü kadın ve çocuklar hedef alınmamıştır ama burada çok iğrenç bir senaryo kuruldu. Müvekkilin iffeti ile oynanmak istendi. Müvekkil iffeti ile ilgili çok yani güya Salim ile aralarındaki ilişki gördüğünden bahisle bu eylemin gerçekleştiğini, işte kendisine anlatıldığını söyleyip bu şekilde bir senaryo uydurulmaya çalışıldı. Ama sizler de tahmin edersiniz ki, Nevzat’ın HTS kaydındaki baz hareketleri, görüşme anları ve diğer hareketleri araç hareketleri görüldüğü zaman böyle bir olayın olağan akışına uygun olmadığını, gerçekçi olmadığını hepimiz görüyoruz. Muhtemelen kamuoyu da bunu biliyor. Yani bu ihtimal devre dışı bırakıldı. Sayın başkanım Nevzat’ın bu beyanlarının hiçbir zaman maddi gerçekle örtüşmediğini biz gözlemliyoruz ve görüyoruz. O halde ne olmuş olabilir? Başkanım özellikle Nevzat saat 15:08’de su bahanesi ile evde olduğu anda Salim Güran’ı aradığını biz biliyoruz. Orada Salim Güran’a soruldu. Ne için? Su kesintisi için gerçekten aradığını söylüyor. Şimdi su kesintisi ile ilgili daha önceden verilen beyanda eşi 20, kendisinin 4-5 gündür su kesintisinin olduğunu, mezarlık yolundaki suyun tıkanıklık olduğunu muhtarı işte bu su sorununu çöz diye aradığını söylüyor. Hatta eşi Gazal Bahtiyar der ki, muhtarı aradığında muhtar der ki, “Ben evdeyim, yemek yiyorum”. Burası çok önemli. Yani gerçekten muhtarın dediği “Evdeyim, yemek yiyorum” adım sayar da evde gösteriyor ama hikaye farklıdır.\n\n\nNevzat’ın Salim’e Yönelik Husumeti ve Cinayet Senaryosu ​\nHikaye şu, Narin kızımız babası Arif Güran ile ilgili Nevzat ve Arif arasında geçmişte araç ile ilgili, çalıntı araç ile ilgili, bir husumetin olduğu, bu husumet nedeniyle tarafların cemaatin toplandığını ve sorununun çözdüğünü söylediler. 50 bin lira için Nevzat’a biçilen 50 bin Nevzat’a biçilen 50 bin ceza ile ilgili kimsenin aklına hani bununla ilgili aklımız ile dalga geçmeyin denildi. Doğrudur, ben de öyle düşünüyorum. Cinayet bununla ilgili olmaz ama her insanda bu meblağın yarattığı husumet farklı olabilir. Biz aslında Nevzat’a bir husumet oluştuğunu nereden anlıyoruz? Nevzat’ın beyanından değil, Nevzat’ın kardeşinin beyanından ve oğlunun beyanından anlıyoruz. Orada sinyali vermiş. Nevzat diyor ki, kardeşi Mehmet’e ve Ferhat’a “Salim Güran ve çevresinden uzak dur”. Bu husumeti beslemiş, içinde beslemiş hatta kardeşi ve oğlunu bu şekilde uyarmış ve bu beyanlara yansıyor. Bu durum yine bu kritik tarihten sonra Salim ile iletişimlerinin Salim tarafından iletişimin kesildiği, hiçbir zaman Mayıs’tan sonra Salim’in kendisini aramadığı açıktır. Dolayısıyla aramadığı ve az da olsa bir küskünlük kırgınlığın olduğu birine gelip işte gel bu cesedi al götür demek akla mantığa aykırıdır. Yine “Yengem ile beraber oldum, gel al götür” demek akla mantığa aykırıdır. Aile içi bir olay ise aile dışından birine bunun yeni bir şahit yaratmanın akıl mantık ile izah edilebilir bir tarafı yoktur. Bizce sayın başkanım, Narin’imiz camiden çıktıktan sonra doğrudan Nevzat’ın cephesine gelecek şekilde, köy yolu Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın cephesinde olacak şekilde devam ediyor. Yani kuzenleri ile birlikte gittiği zaman öncelikle Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın önünden geçmesi gerekiyor. Bizim senaryomuza göre, maddi delillere dayanan senaryoya göre başkası için biz burada aynı zamanda sanık avukatı olarak ve kısmen zımnen de olsa annenin ve katılan gibi davrandığımız da bu yetkiyi kullanarak söylüyorum ki eylemin 15:08 aramasının tek nedeni Salim’in konumunun tespiti ve Salim’in bulunduğu mahalleden emin olma aramasıdır. Hatta ve hatta bu su bahanesi ile yapılan aramanın bir nedeni de sayın başkanım, ayaklı su kulesi köy dışındadır. Belki bu arıza için Salim’i köyün dışına itmeye çalıştı.\n\n\nSuçun Niteliği ve Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın Cezalandırılması Talebi ​\nBilemiyoruz saikini ancak hemen bu aramadan sonra Nevzat’ın baz sinyal bilgisinin değiştiğini GPRS sinyallerinden anlıyoruz ki kritik olan yere yani Narin’imizin 15:11’de okul kamerasına takıldığı yerden, yani evine giden patikada o civarlarda Nevzat’ın baz sinyali verdiğini biz anlayabiliyoruz. Dolayısıyla biz hukuka uygun değerlendirme yaptığımızda kendi inandığımız şüphe ve senaryolara göre değil, ya asla Nevzat böyle bir şey yapamaz, Nevzat gariban, Nevzat işçi, böyle bir şey yapamaz diye yorumlayamayız. Biz oldukça içine kapanık olan ve sessiz olan çoğu insanların da cinayet işlediğini biliyoruz. Bu ihtimali de devre dışına bırakamayız. İhtimalimize göre Nevzat bu sırada Narin’imizi aldı, çağırdı. Kendisi nihayetinde köylü, Narin’imizin güvendiği bir şahsiyet olabilir. Çağırdı, konuşma bahanesiyle götürüp maalesef ahırda kendisine yönelik bir eylemde bulundu. 15:11’den sonra bir eylemde bulunduğu ve 15:41’de aracının göründüğü, Eğertutmaz deresine toprak yoldan, yani yarım saatlik bir zaman diliminde Narin’imize kötü şeyler yapmış olma ihtimalini de gözeterek bu zaman dilimi içerisinde hızlıca cesetten kurtulmaya çalıştı. Sayın başkanım, bu eğer ki, aile içi bir olay olsaydı, emin olun akıl, mantık, hukuk bize şunu veriyor. Bu bize şu işareti veriyor; hiçbir aile bu kadar kısa bir süre içerisinde cinayeti işledi, hemen cesetten kurtulayım, hemen şöyle yapayım telaşına girmez. Önce aile içi bir sorgulama başlar, önce aile içerisinde bir şok hali yaşanır. Cesedi götürüp hiçbir aile kendi evladına bunu reva görmez, götürüp bir derenin kenarına üzerine taş koymak suretiyle gizlemeye çalışmaz. Bir aile yapacağı yani bu kadar kısa bir sürede hareket etmeyeceği malumdur. Dolayısıyla aile dışında bir eylemin gerçekleştiği yönünde bizim kanaatimiz tam ve delil durumuna göre özellikle cesedi gömen araç ile hareket eden ve dolaylı ikrarları bulunan sanığın bu yargılama açısından mahkumiyete yeter, elverişli, sanık yönünde yeter ve elverişli bir delil olduğunu biz görüyoruz. Ve bu yönüyle de çocuğun kasten öldürülmesi suçundan Nevzat Bahtiyar’ın cezalandırılması gerekmektedir.\n\n\nAnne Yüksel Güran’a Yönelik Temelsiz Suçlamaların Reddi ​\nŞimdi iddia makamı bu dava dosyası açısından müvekkil ile ilgili eylem tarifi yaparken az önce de belirttiğim üzere yani müvekkilin somut olarak bu olaya nasıl bir katkısı olmuş, bu hususta bir izahat maalesef biz göremiyoruz. Sadece bir kaç olay açıklanıyor, işte köyde 8 Eylül’de bildiğimiz kadınlar tartışması müvekkilimin kız kardeşi ile Maşallah, Birsen arasında gerçekleşen basit bir tartışma, sanki bu cinayetin aile içinde biliniyormuş gibi yorumlanıp, sanki müvekkilim olayın tarafıymış gibi gösterilmek suretiyle cezalandırılması isteniyor. Bunun maddi hiçbir delilde yeri yoktur. Aynı jandarma tutanaklarından başka tutanağa bakarsanız, Narin’imizin vefat haberi geldiğinde annenin fenalaştığı ve ambulansa bindirildiğine, yani bu olaya dahi şahit olmadığını zaten biz başka bir tutanakta zaten görüyoruz. Böyle bir tutanağın benim müvekkilim aleyhine neden iddianameye işlendiğini gerçekten anlamaktan güçlük çekiyoruz. Yine 2 Eylül tarihli bir jandarma tutanağından, sanırım 2 Eylül, işte orada jandarma personeli bir niyet okuma girişiminde bulunarak müvekkile şunu soruyor; Enes ile basında çıkan haberler ile ilgili ne diyorsunuz diye. Müvekkilim de elbette “oğlum ne olacak” diye refleks gösterecek, bu refleks bu soru üzerine “oğlum ne olacak” oğlu için endişelenmesi kadar doğal bir şey olabilir mi? Basında çıkan haberler ile ilgili oğluna kötü şeyler olabilir denildiği zaman her anne bir refleks gösterir. Ancak bu refleksi Enes’i koruyucu davranışlar sergilediği şeklinde ve tutanakta geçmediği halde bir diyaloğu, yani Narin’in öldüğünden emin şekilde konuştuğu şeklinde tutanağa bağlanmış, oysa tutanağı okuyoruz; nasıl böyle bir niyet okumaya girmiş nasıl böyle bir tutanak tutulmuş gerçekten anlamakta zorluk çekiyoruz. Dolayısıyla anne yönünden bunun bir delil değeri yoktur. Bunun iddianamede işlenmesi, mütalaada işlenmesi, sayın savcım bizce hukuki… Yok yok tartışmaya sebebiyet vermek istemiyorum, bu bizim savunma hakkımızdır. Estağfurullah, yani bence hukuken de tüm hukukçular nezdinde de hiçbir değeri yoktur. Bunun mahkemenizce dikkate alınmasını istiyoruz.\n\n\nMasumiyet Karinesi ve Suçun Şahsiliği ​\nTutanağın değerinin olmadığı, delil değerinin olmadığının mahkemenizce dikkate alınmasını istiyoruz, bunun aksi asla düşünülemez ancak bu davada biz neyi gördük sayın başkanım? Evet, evet. Anayasamız, sayın başkanım, gerçekten ilginçtir. Şöyle ilginçtir, bu davada anayasamızın 38. maddesi o kadar işlevlik kazanıyor ki, nasıl kazanıyor? Ya masumiyet karinesi ile ilgili ihlalin olduğunu, yani 38. maddeye aykırı yayınlar yapıldığı, suçluluğu hükmen sabit oluncaya kadar herkes masumdur. Masumiyet karinesine aykırı yayınlar yapıldığı görünüyor ama jandarma tutanağında Enes’i koruyucu davranışlarda bulunduğu… Ya adete şunu ima ediyor, Enes cinayeti işledi ve anne onu koruyor. Yani bunu ima ediyor. Asla ve asla böyle bir şey yok. Siz anayasanın yine 38. maddesini biz tekrar gözetelim. 38. maddesinde, yani ne diyor? Diyor ki, kendisi ve yakınları ile ilgili hiçbir suretle beyanda bulunmaya kimse zorlanamaz. Susmayı siz suç unsuru olarak da sayamazsınız. Bu mümkün değil, hukuki değil. Yani hiçbir yere sığdıramazsınız. Sayın başkanım, bir diğer husus, suç ve cezaların şahsiliği de ihlal ediliyor. Şöyle ihlal ediliyor. Dolaylı olarak ihlal ediliyor. Ya tutmuşlar, aile üyesi olmayan birilerinin beyanını gerekçe göstererek ailenin bir şekilde hareket ettiğini yani kayıp saati ile ilgili yanıltıcı bilgi verdiğini bir şüphe sebebi olarak söylüyor. Bunun anne ile ne ilgisi var? Anne ile hiçbir ilgisi yok. Siz anayasaya aykırı ifadeler kullanmak suretiyle şüphe yaratamazsınız. Şimdi o beyanlarında asla ve asla müvekkilin dahilinde olduğu, yani Melike ve Birsen Güran’ın aile üyesi dediği, benim müvekkilin çekirdek aile üyesi değil, eşinin amcasının çocukları. Kendi algılarına göre Narin’i gördüğü saat konusunda bir beyanda bulunuyorlar. 17:40’da Narin’in kapıyı çaldığı şeklinde bir beyanda, sonradan bunda yanıldıklarını ifade etmişlerdir.\n\n\nGerçekçi Olmayan Beyanlar ve Delilsizlik ​\nŞimdi yanıldıklarını ifade etmişler. Kaldı ki, bu beyanının müvekkilim ile ilgisi, yani lehine olacak bir durum da değil, şimdi bu beyanın gerçekçi olmadığını, müvekkilim televizyon programında ifade etmesine rağmen ve dosyada bu delil var. Sayın başkanım, sosyal medya görüntüleri şeklinde dosyada o video izlendiğinde görülecektir. Özellikle o video’da Didem Arslan Yılmaz ile yapılan röportaj, o röportajda diyor ki, ya diyor benim çocuklarım Birsen, Maşallah’ın beyanlarını değerlendiriyor, İsa’nın beyanlarını değerlendiriyor. Diyor ki, benim çocuklarım, başka yolu kullanmaz. Niye köyün diğer yollarını, tepeden diğer yollardan geçsin? Benim kızım eğer ki, cami tarafına gitmişse dümdüz yol var, okul yolundan gider. Yani kameraya yansıyan dolayısıyla bu beyanının gerçekçi olmadığını dünyaya herkese haykırmasına rağmen hala bunun müvekkil aleyhine bir beyan olarak delillendirilmesi suretiyle getirilip mütalaaya konulması bizi üzmüştür. Sanırım iddia makamı, geçen celse bizim savunmalarımızın hiçbirine değer vermemiş. Oysa biz gerçekten objektif bu değerlendirmeyi yaptığımızı ve ikna ettiğimizi düşünüyoruz. Sayın başkanım, bir diğer husus, biz Nevzat’ın bu hikayesine inanılmamasının bir diğer göstergesi ise Yüksel ile Salim arasındaki ilişki ve sair çağırma durumu olay gününe ilişkin biz kayıtları incelediğimizde ta bir yıl öncesine HTS kayıtlarına gidin; Yüksel ile Salim arasında 29 mu 30 Temmuz dışında o da hatalı bir arama hiçbir arama yok. Böyle birbiriyle belki de başka aile sorunları var. İletişimleri de yoktur. Yani ama beyanlarda anladığımız kadarıyla, normal bir aile ama arama yok. Şimdi arama olmamasına rağmen siz gelip bunu bir ya da diyelim ki, evde öldürüldüğü iddiası evden aldım cesedi, Salim var. En azından Salim’i telefon ile arama olay gününe ilişkin telefon ile arama olurdu o da yok. Yani biz hangi delile bakarsak bakalım, hiçbir yere bunu sığdıramıyoruz. Sayın başkanım, biz bütün delilleri gerçekten değerlendirdiğimiz de, yani anne Yüksel ile ilgili hiçbir delillin olmadığını ve soyut senaryo ile vicdanlara hukuka aykırı bir karar beklentisinin olduğunu görüyoruz. Bu bizi ürkütüyor. Mahkemenizin asla delilsiz maddi delillere dayanmayan bir karar vermeyeceğine inanıyoruz. Biz vereceğiniz karara elbette herkesin saygısı olacak, itirazı olacak, eleştirilecek de. O ayrı bir husus ama göz göre göre hiç kimse demesin anne ile ilgili herhangi bir delil olmamasına rağmen göz göre göre bu haksızlık bu hukuksuzluğa bizler müdafisi olarak her yerde karşı çıkacağız.\n\n\nGüran Ailesinin Hukuka Saygısı ve Müşterek Faillik İddiası ​\nSayın başkan, şimdi Güran ailesini şeytanlaştırma, ya Nevzat yapmış ise muhakkak ki Nevzat’a karşı bir eylemde bulunmaları lazımdı. Bu ailenin Nevzat’ın bu eylemi gerçekleştirdiğinden bilgisi olsa elbette bir refleks gösterecekti ancak Nevzat alındığı sırada aile fertlerinin çoğu içeride. Yine Nevzat taşındığı sırada ufak tefek tartışmalar oldu, evet var ama şunu unutmayalım ki, Güran ailesinin hukuka saygısı vardır. Hukuka saygılı olduğunu nereden öğreniyoruz? Kendi aile fertlerinden biri daha, daha önceden bir cinayete kurban gitmiştir. Bunun kararını sayın mahkemenize sunuyoruz. Hiçbir zaman bu aile o aileyi hedef alan veya masum eylemi gerçekleştirdiği kişi dışında birilerini hedef alacak bir tavır sergilememiştir. Onlar adaletin hukukun sonucunu bekliyor ve sizin Narin’imizi katleden kişiyi cezalandıracağınıza dair inancı tamdır. Bu nedenle hukuka güvenen, hukuka saygısı olan bir ailedir. Asla dışarıda tanımlandığı gibi bir aile değildir. Sayın başkan, bizler, şimdi iddianamede müşterek faillik esasına göre bir cezalandırma talep ediliyor; şimdi müşterek failden bahsedebilmemiz için arkadaşlarımız ile uzun uzadıya anlattı. Yani bir öncelikle karar, failler arasında bir karar birlikteliğinin olması lazım. Faillerinin tamamının suça katkısı, fonksiyonel etkisi ve fiil üzerinde bir ortak hakimiyetin olması lazım. Biz iddianame ve mütalaada ortak hakimiyet değil, birlikte suç işleme kararını gösteren bir fiil anlatımını göremiyoruz. Göremediğimiz için de ne demek istendiğini de bilemiyoruz. Yani Narin’imiz 4 kişinin birlikte karar alarak, yine bu eyleme beraber iştirak ettiği garabetini biz buna nasıl inanacağız? Biz bunu asla kabul etmiyoruz. Maddi vakalara uygun değil. Narin’imize karşı işlenen eylem belli. Yani boğmak suretiyle, ağız burun kapamak suretiyle eylemin gerçekleştiği ve niteliği itibariyle de bu eylemin niteliği itibariyle de tek kişi tarafından işlendiği açıktır. Hatta boğma boyuna önden baskı suretiyle gerçekleşmiş, tiroid kıkırdaklarında maalesef kırıklar var. Biz ne şekil eylemin gerçekleştiğini de somut vakalara göre anlıyoruz. Bu nedenle biz müşterek faillik esasına göre devletin bu somut vaka içerisinde adaletin bu somut vaka ile ilgili bir cezalandırılma yolunu düşünmüyoruz. Bu adaletsiz bir sonuç doğuracaktır.\n\n\nŞüpheden Sanık Yararlanır İlkesi ve Beraat Talebi ​\nYine bizler şüpheden sanık yararlanır ilkesini asla ve asla unutmamalıyız. Bir anne açısından sayın başkanım, bir anne açısından biz bu davada aslında şunu bekliyorduk. Açılan haksız bir dava nedeniyle anne lekelendi. İffeti ile lekelendi. Kendi çocuğunu öldürme eylemine iştirak ettiği şeklinde bir lekelenme oldu. Biz bu lekeyi kaldırma derdindeydik ama maalesef bizlerin de imkanları sınırlıydı. Yani bizim elimizde laboratuvarlar bizim elimizde başka teknik imkanlar yok. Keşke olsaydı da tam masumiyeti bu eylemde hiçbir şekilde, yani şüphe bırakmayacak şekilde masum olduğunu sizlere ispatlamış olaydık. Öyle bir noktaya geldik ki, biz artık kendi masumiyetimizin ispatı derdindeydik. Yani suça iştirak asla ve asla söz konusu değil. Tamamen masumiyeti ispatlamaya yönelik gayretlerimiz oldu, ceza mahkumiyetleri ihtimallere olasılıklara dayanamaz. Yani gerçekleşme şekli bildiğiniz üzere şüpheli olan olasılıklar üzerinde biz mahkemenin bir vicdani kanaat getireceğine inanmıyoruz. Kesin ve inandırıcı delil olmadığı sürece asla ve asla, bu hangi olay olursa olsun, böyle bir mahkumiyetin söz konusu olamayacağını düşünüyoruz. Sizin sevdiğiniz söz ile tüm bu sebepler ile müvekkil anne Yüksel Güran’ın atılı suçu işlemediği gözetilerek beraatına ve tahliyesine karar verilmesini arz ederiz.",

    "text": "Av. Doğuş Can KURUCU ​\n\nSavunmanın Amacı ve Adil Yargılanma İlkeleri ​\nSayın başkan, biz bir önceki duruşmada savunmamıza başlarken belirtmiş olduğumuz bir hususu yeniden dile getirerek başlayacağız. Çünkü burada bulunmamızın tek nedeni Narin kardeşimizin vahşice bir şekilde katledilmesi ve bu vahşice katledilmesinden kaynaklı olan problemin, bu yaşanan üzücü durumun maddi açıdan şüphe uyandırmayacak şekilde açığa çıkması ve gerçek failin cezalandırılması için buradayız biz. Bunu belirttikten sonra, sayın başkan biz burada savunma müdafiliği rolünü üstlenirken aynı zamanda adil yargılanma için buradayız ve bu adil yargılanma için bizim hukukumuzda ve diğer evrensel bütün hukuklarda Avrupa hukuk sisteminde Çağdaş Ceza Hukukunun evrensel ilkeleri vardır. Bu ilkelerin bu dosya kapsamına da sizin başkanlığınız ve heyetiniz nezdinde şüphe uyardırmayacak şekilde uygulayacağınıza inancımız tamdır. Şimdi sayın başkan kıymetli meslektaşlarımız burada birçok açıklama yaptı. Ben burada sizi çok fazla yormayacağım ancak herkesin değindiği ama ayrıntıya inmediği bir husus var. Önce onunla başlayacağım, şimdi sayın başkan ailenin şüpheli konumuna getirilmesi başta müvekkilim için konuşuyorum. Tabi ben soruşturmanın CMK’nun madde 157 çok açık gizlilik kararı alınıyor ama bu gizlilik kararı alındıktan sonra basına sosyal medyaya dolaylı veya doğrudan nasıl yapıldığını bilmiyoruz, bir şekilde yalan haberlerin pompalandığını biliyoruz. Bu haberler ile birlikte soruşturmanın ben jandarma tutanaklarına gıybet tutanağı diyorum. Bu gıybet tutanakları ile bu objektif olmayan öznel yorumlarla başta müvekkilim olmak üzere ailesi deyim yerindeyse hedef haline getirildi. Şimdi bu yalan haberler ile ilgili ve bu yalan haberlerin soruşturmayı ne kadar etkilediğini, bu soruşturmanın bizce kabul olmayan iddianamesi ve bizce itiraz ettiğimiz mütalaaya dönüşmesine yönelik itirazlarımız var. Biz bunları açıklamak istiyoruz. Tabi bundan önce şundan da bahsetmek istiyorum. Sayın başkanım şimdi artık uzay çağındayız. Bu yüzyılda gerçeklik algısı da oldukça değişkenlik gösteriyor. Maalesef eskisi gibi değil.\n\n\nMedya Çağında Gerçeklik Algısı ve İlk Yalan İddialar ​\nProfesör Doktor Hüseyin Hetemi, aslında ceza hukukçusu değildir, ben kendisinin öğrencisiyim son zamanlarda sosyal medyasını iyi de takip eden biriyim, gezerken gerçeklik ile ilgili şöyle bir şey yazdığını gördüm ben. Önce onunla başlayayım. Şöyle diyor hocamız, sosyal medyaya ve televizyona düşmeyen şey artık gerçek kabul edilmiyor. Bu sebeple gerçek yatağında kıvranarak öldü. Bu yüzyılda yalan ve algının çağıdır. Deccal’ın gözü ise medyadır. Maalesef müvekkilime ve ailesine yönelik yapılan yalan haberler iddianameye ve mütalaaya konu edildi, bundan dolayı biz bunları açıklamak istiyoruz. Şimdi sayın başkan ilk kısma bakalım müvekkil ile ilgili bulunan bir terliğin Narin’e ait olduğu ve annenin bu konuda yanılttığı iddiası vardı ilk başlarda. Zaten dosya bu terlik meselesinin kıymetli meslektaşlarımız da konuştu söyledi; terlik meselesi aile bireylerine fotoğrafı atıldıktan hemen sonra Narin’e ait olmadığı anlaşılıyor, ayak numaralarından dolayı. Bu konu bu şekilde kapandı ama bu sosyal medyada kapanmadı hala konuşuluyor. İkincisi burada Arif bey buradaysa ondan çok özür diliyorum, Enes’ten yine çok özür diliyorum, Yüksel ablam’dan çok özür diliyorum, Narin kardeşimizin Salim’in öz kızı olduğu iddiası çok iğrenç bir şey, mide bulandırıcı bir şekilde kamuoyuna oturdu. Bir annenin, kızını kaybetmiş bir annenin yaşadığı sanki acı yetmiyormuş gibi, iffetine yönelik bir sürü iddialarda bulunuldu. Dosya içerisinde var. Narin kızımızın ki yani böyle raporun olmasından ben şahsen utanarak söylüyorum. Annesinin Yüksel Güran, babasının Arif Güran olduğunun belirtildiği bir rapor da dosya içerisinde mevcut. Bunun da yalan olduğunu söylemek istiyoruz. Bunun dışında burası da önemli, müvekkilim Yüksel Güran bu kan kalıntılarını yok etmek için yeniden kan alıp onun gizlice kendi kanını aldırılıp iddiasıyla hani delilleri yok etmeye çalıştığı bir durum var. Şimdi dosya içerisinde yine akıl dışı kolluk görevlilerinin yapmış olduğu bir faaliyet. Üfürükçü meselesi. Herkesin burada değindiği bir konu biliyorsunuz, üfürükçü meselesinde jandarmanın kendi tutanağı var. Bir anne düşünün ki, o kadar kötü bir durumda hiçbir şeyi sorgulamıyor, kızını bulabilme umuduyla bunlara böyle saçma sapan bir şey söyleniyor.\n\n\nYaygınlaşan Asılsız İddialar ve Medyanın Rolü ​\nBir jandarma tarafından kadın gidip kanını veriyor, bundan dolayı suçlu oluyor. Kimse mesela şunu düşünmüyor, bu kadın o kadar kötü bir durumda ki artık hiçbir şeyi sorgulamıyor. Kızını bulabilmek için o sıra ondan canını isteseler, canını verecek. Bu kan vermenin de bundan başka bir durumu gösterdiğini biz düşünmüyoruz. Yine Salim Güran ile müvekkilim Yüksel Güran’ın olay günü telefon ile görüştüğü iddiası var. Dosya içerisinde zaten mevcut bunlar. Benim müvekkilim Salim Güran’ı hiçbir şekilde aramadığı, dosya içerisindeki belgelerden, arama kayıtlarından net bir şekilde belli ama tabi bunlar yalan haberler. Şimdi bu olay başladığı günden beri bitmek bilmedi. İçişleri Bakanlığı’nın atmış olduğu bir tweet var. Belki görmüşünüzdür. Yaklaşık dört buçuk beş milyonun atıldığı bir tweet var. Narin dosyası ile ilgili bunların %49’u bot hesap, geri kalan normal hesaplardan. Gerçeklik payı burada anlatılan durumlardan ibaret. Hiçbiri gerçek değil. Devam edeceğim. Ben bu halıların yıkandığı iddiası vardı. Halılar şöyle yıkanmış. Yüksel Güran halılarını yıkamış, delilleri karartmış, yok etmiş. Yine rapor da var. Raporda birebir şöyle bir şey geçiyor. “Yapılan tespitler sonucunda halıların yıkanmadığı ve dışarıda herhangi bir müdahaleye ilişkin bir tespit yapılamadığı” direk tutanakta şu şekilde geçiyor. Ama müvekkilim için devam ettiler, durmadılar, durmakta bilmiyorlar. Hala bile atılı tweet’ler var. “Yansın, gebersin”. Ya bu tarz şeyler ile bu dosyanın yargılamasını etkileyenlere en büyük cevabı siz vereceksiniz. Biz buna inanıyoruz. Bunun dışında yine tedbir için tuşlu telefon kullandığı iddiası. Benim müvekkilimin bir tane telefonu vardı. Onda direk soruşturma aşamasında zaten alındı, incelendi. Temiz olduğu da ortaya çıktı. Yine Narin’in bir köpeği olduğu, prenses diye bir ismi olduğu, bu köpek işte bu köpeğin şimdi bir problemi var aslında.\n\n\nTemelsiz ve Cinsel Fantazilere Dayalı Suçlamalar ​\nKöpek ile ilgili haberlerin anneye dokundu, Enes’e dokundu bir de sanırım bu köpeğin bir de hani mide bulandırıcı ama cinsel şeyler ile ilgili saçma sapan, tutarsız dosya içerisinde bulunmayan iftiralar ile başka haberlerle kamuoyunda algı yarattılar ki dosyada ve diğer tanıkların da vermiş olduğu ifadeler, başta babası müşteki taraf Arif Güran ile vermiş olduğu, Narin’in böyle bir köpeğinin hiçbir zaman olmadığı. Kendisi maalesef biz tanıyamadık, vahşice katledilmesinden dolayı köpeklerden korktuğunu da öğrendik. Evlere kameralar takıldı, bütün evler kameralar ile doldu ve bunu söylemediler. Sayın başkan 4 Eylül’de Erhan Güran’ın kamerası vardı, evine taktı. Onun da kendisi de zaten bunun sebebini belirtti. Başka bir kamera da aile bireyleri tarafından takılmadı. Köyde aileden olmayan başka insanların taktığını biliyoruz. Niye taktıklarını da biliyoruz. Korkuyorlar çünkü gece belki bir şey olur, evlerinin önüne bir şey atarlar, suçlanırlar. Yine Enes Güran’ın uyuşturucu bağımlısı olduğu iddiası. Bu sebeple bir şeyler yaptı, sözüm ona müvekkilim anne Yüksel Güran gördü, oğlunu koruyor iddiası tamamen mesnetsiz. Köyde çok sayıda isimsiz çocuk mezarlarının olduğu mesnetsiz, bir de bu dosyanın konusu değil ama ama aile ile ilgili suçlamalar var ve bu suçlamaların birçoğu maalesef ki hep bir cinsel fantezinin doğurmuş olduğu saçma sapan mesnetsiz şeyler. Mesela Hediye Güran ile ilgili, yok ertesi gün hapı almış, yok şöyle olmuş, böyle olmuş. Şimdi sayın başkan dosyada yapılan araştırmalar belli Çarıklı’da bir sağlık ocağına gidiyor, durumunu anlatıyor. Eczaneden alıyor, eşi oradayken alıyor ve ertesi günü hapı değil. Doğum kontrol hapı alıyor. Unutmayalım ki, ben tabi bilemem biyolojik açıdan bir kadın değilim ama benim bildiğim araştırdığım şey, doğum kontrol hapı ile ertesi gününün o hapın aynı işlevde olmadığı, aynı ürün olmadığı. Yine ceset daha hızlı çürüsün diye DSİ’de çalışan amca Kurtuluş Güran güya suyun debisini bilerek yükseltti, ceset bulunmasın diye. Sayın başkan dosya içerisinde DSİ’ye yönelik yazılan müzekkereler vardı. Bu müzekkerelerden sonra Cumhuriyet Başsavcılığı’ndan talep edilmesi üzerine suyun debisinin daha doğrusunun yönünün değiştirildiği belirtildi.\n\n\nŞehir Efsaneleri, Sahte Ses Kayıtları ve Diğer Yalanlar ​\nYani orada çalışan hiç kimsenin böyle bir şey yapma, böyle bir şey yapma yetkisi olmadığı gibi böyle bir durumda söz konusu değil. Bir de Van konusu meselesi vardı. Yani mesela bunu biraz şehir efsanesi diye ben nitelendirdim. Güya Narin yaşıyormuş, helikopterle Van’a kaçırmışlar, hastaneye bırakmışlar. Ütopik kurgular, en önemlisi sayın başkanım ben buranın çok önemli olduğunu düşünüyorum, maalesef bu dosyadan prim kazanan bazı gazetecilerin en büyük haberi şuydu “Ramazan kız öldü mü, yaşıyor mu” iddiası ile bir ses kaydı varmış. Güya bu ses kaydı bir önceki duruşmada da daha detaylı bir şekilde incelendi. Konuşulan Kürtçe Türkçe’ye çevrildiğinde herkesin bunu gayet iyi anladığını düşünüyorum. Böyle bir durumunda olmadığını, bir de sayın başkan Beşikdüzü Belediyesi varmış Beşikdüzü. Bu bendost diye bir Twitter kullanıcısı varmış sayın başkan. Yardım toplamış Narin için fidan dikilecek diye Beşikdüzü, sonra insanları dolandırmışlar. Beşikdüzü Belediyesi de kendi Twitter hesabında bunu paylaştı. Bu dolandırıcılara ön ayak olmayın diye, inanmayın diye, köyde kanlı eldivenlerin bulunduğu iddiası da vardı, yalanlandı. İmam için iki farklı senaryo üretildi. Bunlardan birincisi imam işin içinde iddiası. Mahkemece dinlenmedi bile. Bu dosya için aslında mahkeme salonunda birde imamın telefonunda uygunsuz içeriklerin bulunduğu yine dava dosyası ile alakası yok ama dava dosyası ile alakası olmayan bir çok husus bugün burada müvekkilimizin yargılamasına sebebiyet verdi diye biz bunları anlatmak zorunda kaldık. İmamın telefonunda uygunsuz içeriklerin bulunduğu iddiası da şu şekilde çıkıyor ortaya. Savcılıkta yapılan bir dosyada, biz gördük, görüşmede şöyle bir şey diyor. Telefonun yeni alınmış gibi temiz bir telefon olması tutanakta öyle geçiyor. Yani herhangi bir telefonda bahsedilen bir şey de yok. Patates hatlar iddiası da yalanlandı. Onu diğer meslektaşlarımız çok iyi açıkladığı için ben burada ekstradan tekrar yapmak istemiyorum.\n\n\nYalan Narratiflerin Yargılamaya Etkisi ve Usul Hataları ​\nJandarmayı yanıltan işbirlikçiler 6 yaşında, 6 yaşında dedikleri sanırım Narin’in küçük kardeşi. Burada gördük zaten nasıl durumda olduğunu ki o küçük çocuğun iddiaları ile bir keleş bulundu. Yani o sözüne istedikleri zaman itibar ediliyor ama mesela Narin’in eve hiç gelmediğini çıktıktan sonra söyledi. O zaman kimse ona dikkat etmiyor, şimdi son olarak bence en çılgın şey bu konu ile ilgili bir dizi çekildi. Daha doğrusu dizide bir bölüm çekildi, yani sayın başkanım buranın Türkiye olduğunu insanlar maalesef unutuyor ve bu gerçeklik algısı insanlar bir şeye inanmaya başladığı zaman sosyal medyada iyi bir haber yani burada şey denilirdi bir insan köpeği ısırırsa haber olur. Burada öyle bir şey yani sürekli bir şey arıyorlar. Yani kimsenin bir şey bilmediği, olan her şeyin gerçek bir şekilde aklına kimse inanmıyor. Tabi biraz önce başka bir meslektaşımız yine kurtlar vadisinden örnek vermişti. Bu bir karakter öldü, bu karakterin hala biz gıyabi bir şekilde cenaze namazını kılıyoruz, yani bu ülkenin toplumdaki insanların bir şeye inandığı zaman ne kadar sıkı sıkıya bağlı olduğunu görüyoruz. Bu sebeple bunların hiçbirinin yani şimdi bu yalan haberler iddianamede önceden yürütülen soruşturmanın ne kadar niteliksiz olduğu, kolluk personellerinin gıybet tutanakları ile birlikte iddianame konu edilmesini biz doğru bulmuyoruz. Biz iddianameyi son gün sosyal medya aracılığı ile öğrendik. Böyle bir yargılamanın olmasını istemiyoruz. Yine bu daraltılmış baz ile ilgili ve bilirkişiler ile ilgili birçok meslektaşımız burada çok ayrıntılı açıklamalar yaptı. Bizden önceki duruşmada bir beyanda bulunmuştuk, Yargıtay’ın bir çok kararı şunu söylüyor “Alanında uzman olmayan bilirkişilerin raporlarının hükme esas alınması hukuka uygun değildir”. Şimdi sayın başkan biz bu bilirkişilerin hangi konuda uzman olduğunu bilmiyoruz. Keşke bilirkişiler buraya gelselerdi, bizde onlara sorular sorsaydık çünkü bu bilirkişi raporlarının diğer yine kıymetli meslektaşlarımızın söylediği gibi ucube bir rapordan başka bir şey olmadığını söylüyoruz. Bunun dışında iştirak iradesi ile ilgili de şimdi müvekkilim çok ayrıntılı açıklama yaptı. Ama bizim müvekkil nezdinde bu iştirak müşterek faillik durumunun suçun oluşma şekillerinin hiçbir şekilde oluşmadığını, bu suçun unsurlarının oluşmadığını düşünmekteyiz. Onun dışında, neyse ona girmeyeceğim, beni dinlediğiniz için teşekkür ederim. Ben müvekkilimin bir an önce beraat kararı ile tahliye edilmesini talep ediyorum. Son savunmaydı, yorulmuştunuz daha fazla da uzatmak istemedim teşekkür ederim.",

    "text": "Presiding Judge ​\n\nPresiding Judge : Mr. Nevzat, the indictment has been served to you. You have read it. According to the indictment, it is requested that you be punished for killing Narin Güran in participation with the other defendants. What do you have to say? I am listening. Go ahead.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I am only remorseful.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Start from the beginning. Where were you on the day of the incident? How did you meet? Whom did you meet? Let’s start from that. Why did you call Salim? Start from there.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had called Salim for water.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, can you take the microphone? You will be more comfortable. Okay, now I am listening.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I called for water.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Our water supply had been cut off.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Your water supply had been cut off? Now… Okay, your water was cut. You called. Then?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Do I have the right to speak? Or do I also have the right to remain silent?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have all rights. But to our questions… Tell us the incident so we can direct our questions accordingly. Do you want to tell the incident?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Very well… You have statements given to the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office. Are those statements correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : They are correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Which is correct? There is a difference between one statement and the second statement. Is the most recent statement you gave the correct one?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The most recent statement I gave is correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Are you repeating that statement exactly?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is the most recent statement you gave correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You are repeating that statement here in court now, are you not?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. Let me briefly read your statement. I will go through these quickly. Following this, Salim Güran told me “I will call the authorities about the malfunction.” Afterwards, there was no further conversation between us. Immediately after this conversation, I left my residence and, using a water hose from my neighbor mother’s residence, which is adjacent to me, I began to water the trees in front of my residence. Although my mother is our neighbor, the water lines that come to our residences are different and because there was a fault only in the water line coming to my residence, I was able to take water from my mother’s residence. Approximately 15 minutes after I began watering the trees in front of my residence, from the garden of the residence belonging to Arif Güran, which is approximately 100 meters from my residence and located at a higher elevation relative to my residence, Salim Güran called out to me from there saying he had business with me, that he would come to me by vehicle and that I should prepare; upon this I stopped watering the trees and began waiting for Salim Güran in front of my residence.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I had gone up.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What do you mean?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had gone to Arif Güran’s house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now after he said “I have business with you, come,” did you go up on foot?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I went up.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where was your car at that time?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My car was down below.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It was down below. You were around Arif Güran’s house on foot, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where was Salim Güran in the meantime?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He was up above.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where do you mean by “up above”?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean above our house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is “above your house” the area of Arif Güran and his barn?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you meet there with Salim Güran?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When you met there, who else was present?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see anyone else.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now Mr. Nevzat, at 15:18, at 15:08 you call Salim and you have a phone conversation. At 15:18 you are near Arif’s house. When he called you while you were near Arif’s house, did you see anyone else besides Salim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No. “Approximately 15 minutes after I began watering the trees in front of my residence, from the garden of the residence belonging to Arif Güran, which is approximately 100 meters from my residence and located at a higher elevation relative to my residence, Salim Güran called out to me saying he had business with me, that he would come to me by vehicle and that I should prepare; upon this I stopped watering the trees and began waiting for Salim Güran in front of the residence.” you said in your earlier statement. In your statement here in court you said you went on foot, you did not go by car. At that time you said you did not see any person or vehicle in the area. A few minutes later Salim Güran arrived in front of my residence with a Renault vehicle bearing license plate 47 XX 388, coming from the direction of the mosque within the village rather than from the school.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now when Salim Güran said to you “Come, I have business with you,” where was he such that he later came by car — I do not understand?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He had business up above.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was in the courtyard watering the trees. He said “I have business with you” and asked “Will you come up?” I said okay I am coming.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, after that was he in his car at that time?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He was waiting outside. He did not have a car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : This leads to a contradiction here too. “He told me ‘Get in the car immediately and follow me’.” Did such a thing occur?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It did not. At that time I did not see anyone or any blanket in the vehicle Salim Güran was using. When Salim Güran moved off in his vehicle I then followed him with my vehicle registered to my son but used by me, bearing license plate 23 XX 630. These places were not like that then. It is not like that. You met entirely on foot. So why did you give such a statement to the prosecutor then?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was somewhat frightened.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of whom were you frightened?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had been frightened then because he had threatened me with a firearm and with my family, so I could not give my statement fully and comfortably then…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not give it fully and comfortably. Are you under any pressure, torture, or violence at present?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You are giving these statements now of your own free will, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Was any pressure exerted on you to make these statements or to change these statements for those listening to them after this investigation or after the lawsuit was filed?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Was anyone offering money saying “Nevzat, accept the crime, admit that you killed Narin, confess, we will look after you, we will look after your children, we will give you land”? Was such an offer made? Such an offer was not made by Salim Güran and his family, right?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see such a thing at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, has anyone made such an offer to you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Not in prison. Okay. Now we will actually read this statement. After we resolve these contradictions, then I proceed to the part you described in your second statement. “Later we entered Arif Güran’s house together with Salim Güran. When we entered this house there was one room. All the doors of the rooms were closed.” Is that correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : “I did not see Enes Güran, Yüksel Güran, Eren Güran, Muhammed Güran or anyone else inside the house.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : “As I did not hear any noise, I do not know whether those in the closed rooms were present inside them.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : “When we entered the house and Salim Güran took me to one of the rooms on the left, I saw Narin Güran lying motionless on the floor.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now Mr. Nevzat, what puzzles me is this. Salim told you “Come I have business.” You went to Salim, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : At that time did you hear any shouting, any scream, any sound related to the killing of the child from inside the house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you did not hear any shouting from the house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then you did not know why Salim had called you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : At first I did not know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : At first you did not know. When you entered the house and saw Narin’s corpse you learned. I will ask this question repeatedly. Think carefully. Was there anyone else at the location in question besides Salim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Are you sure?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I am sure.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Arif’s house and Salim’s house are adjacent. There is not a large distance between them. They can hear each other’s shouting. When you looked at Salim’s house was there anyone there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No. Okay. “When we entered the house and Salim Güran took me to one of the rooms on the left, I saw Narin Güran lying motionless on the floor. As I recall there was a foam-like fluid coming from Narin Güran’s mouth. Salim Güran told me that because Yüksel and I were together the girl saw us, that this girl killed me. I killed this girl. Now you are also my accomplice. You witnessed this event. Therefore you will eliminate this. Otherwise I will take your son from the football school he attends and shoot him in the head,” threatening me and offering me money.” you had stated.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Could you tell this to us again? You entered the house.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had entered the house. I went in, I looked, he took me into a room. I looked, Narin was lying there. She was lying there. He told me such an event.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What did he mean by “such an event”?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : That she had a relationship with his mother.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So then is it like this: While Salim and Yüksel were having sexual intercourse, Narin came home and saw them; because she saw them they killed her, is that what he said?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He said so. But now at 15:08, look, we have these HTS records. What is the brand of the phone you used?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Samsung.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Was it an A5?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : C3.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It was something like that, okay. We have looked at it. Not very important. Which SIM did you use?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Thirty-three.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Turkcell. Now look, when the HTS report is obtained you call Salim at 15:08 regarding water, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then about 10 minutes later, at approximately 15:18, you are near Arif’s house. Salim tells you to come. Correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : According to the latest camera footage in the file, according to the latest camera footage in the file Narin appears on the path from Tavşantepe school toward the trail at 15:15. Let’s add 5 minutes to Narin’s arrival at home. Let’s say 20 minutes. At 15:20 during this interval was Salim with you? At what time did he have intercourse with Yüksel so that Narin saw?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I did not see.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I ask again. At 15:08, at 15:18 when he said “come,” did you see Salim at all before he said “come”? Until he said “I have business with you” did you see him?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But you were around the house in the meantime.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was at home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Which house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My own house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Were you at your own house watering the garden?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I was watering the garden from my own house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Approximately how many meters are there between your house and Arif’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There are around 50 meters.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : How about Salim’s house? Is that also very close?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It is also close.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you did not see Salim outside during that time.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When you first saw Salim did he come out of Arif’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see him then.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You only saw Salim in the garden.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I watered in the garden. He came up and I saw him. I did not see anyone else.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not see from where he came up.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you see where Salim’s car was at that time?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see his car there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not see his car either. While you were watering at your home — because I repeat this repeatedly, because we are taking fragmented statements, so that our statements are clear, okay? — therefore I keep asking repeatedly. After you called Salim and while you were watering in your garden, after approximately how many minutes? After about 10–15 minutes upon Salim calling out to you you saw Salim, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Apart from that you saw nothing else.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. You entered the house. You saw Narin’s corpse in the house. Then what did you discuss with Salim? Could you tell that part to us again?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Then he told me, you will take it and make it disappear.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Take it where, make it disappear?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Take it and throw it somewhere.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There is a missing part in the statement here. Mr. Nevzat. Now you entered the house. After seeing the corpse what plan did you make? Who advised you to get a sack? Who advised you to take it to the relevant stream and throw it there? How did you plan these? Who thought of it? Where did the idea come from? Or who told you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Salim told me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did Salim tell you to “make it disappear”? To take the corpse, to the streambank, to leave it there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. He said put it there. Also throw it into the water in pieces. So that no one sees, let it disappear. I then took it there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Have you ever seen another corpse in your life?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It is the first time you have seen a corpse. Where does this composure come from? I mean, while a person who sees a corpse should be flustered, how did you manage to take the corpse, put it in a sack or whatever and carry it somewhere with such composure while doing these things?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was somewhat affected. When I first saw, my whole body, so to speak, seized up. But after he told me, I was compelled. I had to do it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : With what did he threaten you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He threatened me with a firearm.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What did he say?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He said to me, “I will take your son Muhammed, who goes to school. First I will shoot him in the head, then I will shoot you.” For that reason I felt compelled and accepted.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And during this time you did not see Enes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not see Muhammed Emre, Eren, or anyone at all?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see anyone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, after you made this plan, was Narin wrapped in a blanket when you saw her?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where did you get the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Salim went and brought the blanket; I do not know from where he brought it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did he go and bring it from another room?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It was not in the room, that is, it was in the car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So did Salim go outside the house or go to another room?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, he went out like that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He went outside the house and brought the blanket, is that so? Narin was lying on the floor, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not hear any sound inside the house? You did not see anyone. Okay, after wrapping with the blanket, what did you do?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : After wrapping with the blanket, I slowly brought her home. I brought her to the barn of our house. There we put her into a sack. There I went to the car. He also came by car, he came next to our car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment, did you take the body with the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I placed it inside the blanket and took it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where did you take it in the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I took it next to the car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where was your car?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : In front of the door.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In front of your door. Then did no one see this at that time?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, no one saw.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No one saw. You took the blanket in your arms. You took it to your own car. You took it to your red car with plate 23 AN, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : During this time, no one in the vicinity saw?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where was Yüksel?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : At that time, when I put Narin into the car, I lifted my head. I saw she was up above, crying.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where was she crying?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : On the hill.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now after you took her from the house, after you wrapped Narin in the blanket, after wrapping in the blanket, where did Salim go?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : After I went down, he also came down by car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now you went out with the blanket.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I went out.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : After you left Arif’s house, where did you go first? Did you go to the barn?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I took her to the barn.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Whose barn is this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It was our barn.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Your barn. Why did you take her to the barn?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I put her into a sack there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : How did this come to mind?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I put her into a sack.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why did you not take her with the blanket but thought to put her into a sack? Did this occur to you? Did you think of it? Did it occur to you? Did Salim tell you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I thought of it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So Salim handed her to you in the blanket and told you to dispose of it.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : After that, in the planning, Salim had nothing to do with it. You planned it, is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I could not comprehend how you thought to put her into a sack, that as well.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I took her to the barn. Our sack was there. Let me put her into the sack.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : At that time did the girl Narin have clothes on her? On her person? Was she naked or clothed?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : She had clothes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you remember the clothes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There was a black T-shirt.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you remember her bag, etc.?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You do not remember. You put her into the sack. “When I took the corpse in my arms and left the residence, I also, upon Salim’s instruction, took the slippers belonging to Narin that were in front of the door and put them inside the blanket.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : “And I went down toward my residence to place it in my vehicle.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : “First I placed the corpse through the window into the barn belonging to me.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : “Then I passed the sack over the head of the corpse in the barn. I hastily passed the sack over the head of the corpse but I had not tied the sack. Then I left the corpse on the floor mat area of the back seat of my own vehicle.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What did you do with the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Salim came for the blanket, he came by car. He came by car and took the blanket from me. Then they went downwards. I do not know which direction he went after that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now did Salim come to your barn by car?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, no. He came to the front of the door, next to the car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now one moment, I will start from the beginning. You went to the barn, you put her into the sack. Where did you leave the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I took the blanket next to the car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You took the blanket together with the sack as well?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. Was the blanket wet?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, there is a DNA that came up in Salim’s car. There was foam at her mouth. Now if the blanket was wet, could the foam or saliva or something else coming from her mouth have contaminated the blanket, and upon taking the blanket it might have transferred to Salim? In other words, was there any wetness on the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not notice at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not pay attention; you do not know. Then you came to your own house. You came with the blanket and the sack. Who stays in your house? Your spouse?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My spouse was staying.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do your mother and father reside with you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where was your spouse at that time?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My mother was inside the house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Your spouse?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My spouse was inside as well.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But they were not outside?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then you placed the sack in your car. We will now say sack; the corpse, Narin, is inside the sack. Where in your car did you place the sack?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had placed it on the back seats of the car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : On the back seat of the car? You placed it on the floor mat area, is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. Did Salim come to you at that time?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Salim came.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What did Salim say to you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He told me, take it. We call it the lake.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, we call it the lake. To the lake?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Take it there, throw it in pieces. Let no one see. Then I took it there. I did not interfere at all. I mean I did not interfere with the corpse; I left the corpse there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You left the sack. Mr. Arif, could we be a bit calmer? Mr. Arif, there is a restroom on the side. We can take you there to wash your face if you like. Let us take him to the restroom. Okay. You took it there and somehow threw the sack, is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I left it there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Well, did you tell Salim the place where you left it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then later that evening at 22:47 Salim goes to the place where the sack, the corpse, was found. How does Salim know that place?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It is visible from above.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That is the place you call the lake, right?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, the lake.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : After this incident, after you threw it into the lake, did you speak with Salim and say something like I handled it, it is done?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then did Salim ask you whether this matter was done?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, we did not meet at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not speak afterward?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : We did not speak.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not tell Salim where you put it, like I put it under this tree, I put a stone, etc.? Then did Salim, on his own initiative, go at night to that stream where it was found and observe the sack?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know that. The first time I took it there, it is visible from the side of the house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He may have seen your car. Now during this search, this incident occurred. These occurred on 21.08. Subsequently, a missing person report for Narin was made, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : After the missing person report was made, did you have any conversation or meeting with Salim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So after this incident did Salim not tell you to keep your mouth shut, keep quiet, do not tell anyone anything?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not speak at all after this incident?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Only once he came to my mother’s courtyard. There was a well there, an old well. He had come there with the gendarmes. I spoke with him there. I had no other conversation.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You had no conversation. Then why did you not come and tell the truth until the body was found, and only felt the need to speak after the body was found?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was afraid.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Whom were you afraid of? You are a stranger in this village, are you not? That is, is this the Güran Family’s village, or is it your own village?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It is their village.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You are someone who came from outside and is staying in the village, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You stated that at that moment, when I looked upward, that is toward Arif Güran’s house, I saw Yüksel Güran looking while crying with her face in her hands. So you saw from the window?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I saw by the car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where by the car did you see? Did you see from the rear-view mirror, did you look back from the car? Or while the car was moving did you see from the side?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : When I put it on top of the car, I closed the door. I looked up; she was crying up above.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Before the car moved, while you were in front of your own house, you saw, is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She was looking from the window, is that so? Yüksel?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. The front of our house is elevated.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So had she left the house, or was she inside the house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : She was not; I do not know that. I saw her on the hill. I did not see her elsewhere.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You saw Yüksel not in the house, but in the place where her house’s barn is, on the hill, watching you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : That is correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You do not know how she got there. Did you see Enes during this time?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have no idea regarding Enes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Well then, if we ask the same question again from the beginning, do you know how Narin was killed; that is, whether they killed her by strangling, by stabbing, by administering poison, or by some other possibility?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When you arrived at the house you knew Narin was dead. In your view, how might Narin have been killed?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know, in my opinion she may have been killed by strangulation; that is what I think.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You think that, but did you encounter any bleeding, a knife, anything like that on Narin; was there blood?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There was not. Then a case was also brought against Enes for intentional killing in participation. According to what you describe, Salim and Yüksel killed her. Where does Enes fit in this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have no information about Enes. You took the body toward the Eğertutmaz stream, and previously one of Narin’s feet had remained outside the sack. “Because I did it in haste and panic, I could not tie it, and I could not fix this. After leaving the body as I indicated, I left the scene.” Then why did you not dismember the body but placed it whole inside the sack?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I could not do it, I mean my conscience…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You could not do that?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I could not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then while placing it inside the sack, so that the sack would flow away from that lake — after all, the sack might move, the water could carry it away — did you secure it with stones so that the water would not carry it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I left only one stone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why did you leave that stone?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I left that stone, I did it so that it would go under the water.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But rather than making it go under the water, if you had thrown that sack directly into the water and the water had carried it away, was that not the instruction given to you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did this on your own initiative, correct? As for Salim — is there any possibility that he told you to put it on a stone so it would stay there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because at later stages, in Yüksel’s press statements or interviews given to radio or television, there are statements like “Whoever killed her, let them bring her; at least let us know the location of the body.” You must have seen these while searches were being conducted, correct? On television?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You do not remember. Then after this incident did Yüksel have any conversation with you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did Enes have any conversation?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then only Salim and Yüksel knew that you carried the sack there, is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And Arif Güran did not know either, is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then let me ask these and move to other matters. Now, in Salim’s statements — in his first statements — he claims he was doing field work, then went home, that he was not at the locations in question. Later, after this incident, he again goes to the field. Do you know what Salim did after this incident?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What did you do after you left the body in the field?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : After leaving it, I went to my sister-in-law’s house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You went to your sister-in-law Zeynep’s house, okay.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : She had prepared cheese for us; I took the cheese and went home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now Nevzat, the matters you describe — to find the right phrasing… you are describing them very coolly. Now you say you saw a corpse for the first time in your life, correct? You say, “I saw the body, I did not know what to do, therefore I could not dismember it,” but after leaving the body there, you continue your life as if nothing had happened.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : These two are very difficult. Are you seeing a corpse for the first time in your life?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have the right not to answer this question — have you ever killed someone before in your life?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You saw a corpse for the first time in your life, you disposed of that corpse, and then, as if nothing had happened, you went to get cheese from your sister-in-law, is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I am asking repeatedly because we are extracting words with tweezers; since we are extracting words with tweezers, so that they are properly recorded in the minutes. Friends, pay attention to the questions I ask so that you too may ask the same questions — it is your right — but as far as possible when asking the same question, please be mindful of this. Apart from “throw it into the stream, dismember it,” did you have any other meeting or conversation with Salim, did you provide him with any information at all?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Until you yourself sought effective remorse — rather, let us not call this effective remorse — until you confessed, you did not speak with anyone on this matter, is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : That is so.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You decided by yourself to confess as well, is that so? Why did you confess?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My conscience.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In any case, let us say your conscience did not accept. We do not know what Salim did with the blanket. No message came to you in prison; like “accept the murder, change your statements,” there was no such message, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Your brother said on this matter, “A message was sent to my elder brother by Ali Rıza; let Nevzat accept all the blame, we will give him a car and a field.” Did such a request come to you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It did.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You said no.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, now an offer came — my brother said there is such an offer — but they did not come and tell me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I see, so no one came and made such an offer to you, but your brother came and said “Brother, there is such an offer.” Then did any message come to you from your spouse?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : None came.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have the right not to answer this question; Arif Güran alleges that Salim had a relationship with your spouse. There is such a press statement. There are also some reports that you are slandering. Is such a thing true?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not say such a thing; I did not see it with my own eyes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You do not know. Are you slandering the Arif Güran family, Salim, or the Güran family?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is there any enmity between you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : They say this: In the objection to detention by Salim Güran’s attorney, there is the following claim: “Nevzat was giving money; again on the day of the incident he gave money to Narin; he accustomed Narin to himself and on the day of the incident he killed Narin; he had been planning this 3–4 days in advance. For this reason he was giving money to the children.” What do you say about this allegation?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Were you giving money to the child?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Again, the defense attorneys of the defendants say that after leaving school, for Narin to go to her own house she had to pass in front of your house or in front of your barn; is that correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It is a bit farther; there is a distance of 30–40 meters.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So after passing that path, in order for her to reach her own house, does she need to pass in front of your house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Even if she passed from another place, then it would be very far. The nearest — that is, the distance is there; she passed from there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Well then, were you under any plan at that time; now, let me say this — I am speaking of the objections in the objection petition of the defendants’ counsel; this is not the court’s acceptance. Let there be no misunderstanding on this matter; I am reading the objection petition in the detention objection of the defendants’ counsel, okay? Now they claim this: that your mother heard that all the men of the Güran family were out of the village to distribute invitations, that your mother heard this and told you, and upon this you made a plan to kill Narin; on the day of the incident you waited for Narin in front of the house, when Narin arrived you took her and killed her.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It is not true.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you have any enmity with the Güran family?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Are you their worker?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Are you someone engaged in plastering work in the village; do you do it in the village or in the city?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do it in villages.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you work in the Güran family’s field?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then there are contradictions among your statements. Is the statement you have given here in court of your own free will to our court correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : These are the clearest statements you have given, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In the statements you gave to the prosecutor’s office you told different things because you were afraid, is that so? Salim gave you the slippers, is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did he say anything while giving the slippers?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, he did not say anything.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In the sense of “Take these, conceal the evidence,” is that so?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I took them and put them in the sack.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is there anything else we did not ask or forgot? Let us look at our notes; Mr. Prosecutor, do you have anything to ask?​",

    "text": "Trial Prosecutor ​\n\nTrial Prosecutor : We have questions to ask. Nevzat Bahtiyar, just now in your statement before the court you said that Salim frightened you with a firearm.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Between 15:27 and 15:35 on the day of the incident, the four of you are in the same place; I am referring to our own base station data. Was it during this period that he threatened you? Did he have a firearm with him? Where did this threat with the firearm occur?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He had a firearm with him; he drew it.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What did he do after drawing it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He threatened me with the firearm: “You will dispose of this corpse; otherwise I will take your son and then call you, and in front of your eyes I will shoot him in the head. Then I will shoot you in the head.” He made such a threat to me; I was compelled.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So he did this with the firearm he had with him?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Mr. Prosecutor, my apologies. Then according to your allegation Salim sees Enes during a sexual intercourse; therefore, what was Salim’s attire at that time?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Was it clothing hastily put on?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Was there any sweat due to the incident or anything that caught your attention?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not pay any attention.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Was he as composed as you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : In the WhatsApp logs retrieved for Salim Güran there is a 41-second call from you at 17:46; 9779 is your number, is it not? There is a 41-second call from this number; I am speaking of 17:46. You took her to the stream and handled the matter, did you not? What did you discuss in this call?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not speak at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There is a 41-second call.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not speak at all.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Okay, at 22:44 in the evening Salim goes to the place where our girl Narin’s lifeless body was found, by giving some information and from the camera footage. You mention a single stone or 2–3 stones, correct? There are additional twigs and brush left on the body; could Salim Güran have done this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no idea; I did not see.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why did you call on WhatsApp? I am missing that.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not call anyone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You use the number the prosecutor mentioned, do you not?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Normally I called him once.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In the information provided, in the WhatsApp history it has been determined that you called Salim at 17:46 at the time in question.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I never called; I do not know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : At that time had you gone to your sister-in-law for cheese?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was in Çarıklı at 17:30.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : On the day of the incident, you say again that you carried Narin in your arms to the stream, correct? Into a sack, you put her into the sack, you did not tie the mouth of the sack with a rope. You walked toward the stream. In August, in the heat of August, you walked toward the stream. A 25-kilogram girl — were you alone?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was alone.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Salim was not with you; you walked. You looked for a rope; where did you find a rope there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had cut the strap of the bag; I tied it with that.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : How did you trust going without taking a rope? Where would you find a rope there among the stones and gravel?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : At that moment a rope did not cross my mind at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, Mr. Nahit, please.​",

Nahit Eren : Your Honor, before moving to the question, of course we are discussing evidence here. I will say only one sentence. First of all, your decision to accept the Diyarbakır Bar Association’s request to join was meaningful and valuable for this case file. We have been following the case file since the first day. And today, all of us have taken our place in this trial to bring out the material truth. I will begin asking my questions to Nevzat. Nevzat, how long have you known Salim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Well… 30 years, there are 30 years. It may be more because we have been together since childhood.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You were very close friends.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You meet constantly.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Constantly — that is, not constantly. I mean… when we had time he would call me, I would call him. We would go to the coffeehouse.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : For example, where would you meet?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Mostly — that is, we would meet at the coffeehouse. I mean we would also meet in the village.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Would you come together in the village and walk on those paths?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. I mean we would make tea and drink it. That is, we would sit.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you ever go to his house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have gone.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you enter the house and be a guest?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have been a guest.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you go any time close to the incident?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You did not.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : We went once. There… Not on the second day of the incident. I went up. The Gendarmerie was there. Like… I stayed for 15–20 minutes and went down.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Alright, let us come to the day of the incident. You said you called Salim at eight past three (15:08) on the day of the incident.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you remember the sentences you spoke when you called Salim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you remember what you discussed?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : What we discussed — I told him to check the water. He said, “Alright, I will call the team. Let the team come and check.”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Was it your house’s water that was not running?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. Water was not running in our house.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Well, did you make any request to the municipality about this in any way?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no knowledge.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In the municipality’s determination reflected in the file there is a minute stating there was no water malfunction at your house. Are you aware of this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no knowledge.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Alright, you spoke at 15:08. After you spoke, can you fully describe the direction for us? Your direction of going. You said you went to water the trees.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Where did you water the trees?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : In the courtyard.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You watered in the courtyard in front of where your house is located?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How many minutes did the watering take?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : From where did you bring the water?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : From my mother’s.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Was the hose attached?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The hose was attached.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What distance? Between your house and your mother’s?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : About 20 meters.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : From there to your house there is a hose connected.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. I had connected it. I… As I was coming I connected it. I thought I would water the trees a bit.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Could you tell again how many minutes you watered?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You do not remember. In her statement to the prosecutor, your spouse Gazal says that you called Nevzat — pardon, that you called Salim. Then she says you left the house. He was actually going to water the trees but he did not water the trees.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, there are no trees. I was in the backyard at that time. I had really gone there to the backyard a bit. I was there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The trees in front of the house, or the ones behind the house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The back. The ones at the back. I was there. She did not see me.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Alright. You called Nevzat — pardon, you called Salim. Salim told you these things. After you talked with Salim, did you go toward Arif’s house or toward Salim’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I went toward Arif’s house.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You went toward Arif’s house. The HTS records say you went toward between Arif’s and Salim’s houses.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. I did not go that way.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You did not go toward Salim’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Well, the first time you went, how long did Salim have contact with you outside?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Since you spoke with Salim on the phone that day, did you have any intention to come together as usual in the friendship you had, knowing he was at home?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did he come to the garden and call you from above?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Can you tell us how many minutes after the minute you spoke?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You do not remember.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : For example, can you say this? I watered such-and-such number of trees or such-and-such an area of vegetables, I changed the water this many times. This would take 2–3 minutes; then Salim called me — can you say that?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I cannot.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You cannot. Then did you head directly to the house? Did you head directly to Salim’s house? What did he say to you outside such that you headed to Salim’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He…​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I am asking about the first contact. You say he called out to you. You went. Salim is standing in front of Arif’s house. You made contact with Salim. What did Salim say to you at the first moment? The first moment. Did you greet each other, for example?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What did he say to you? Well, you are talking about a 30-year friendship. Regarding entering inside, entering together with Salim — because Arif has a statement: he said Nevzat had never in his life entered Arif’s house. Have you ever previously entered Arif’s house in your life? Unrelated to this incident.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have gone once.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you not remember why you went? For example, the year.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember. I went once but I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You went; Salim is there. You made contact. Without saying what he said, you headed toward the house.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : After I went there I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I am not asking about Narin. From the moment you made contact with Salim, I am talking about the time until you entered the house. You did not speak; he said “Let us enter the house.” You entered together without questioning anything?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You entered the house. Were there shoes in front of the door?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Were there old shoes? I will ask shortly so let me ask now. You took the slippers from in front of the door and put them into the blanket — when you took them, were there other shoes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Were there old ones? That is, in front of the door was there an arrangement of shoes that would show us a crowd inside the house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. It did not catch my attention.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you not remember? Think, think. Bring that moment to your mind’s eye.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I am thinking.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What is the distance between Salim’s house and Arif’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know that much.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But we can see Salim’s house quite easily from Arif’s house, right?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Was there a vehicle in front of the house? Was there a vehicle?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not look that way at all. That is, it did not catch my attention.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But when you walk, when you go to Salim’s door area, when you go toward Arif’s house, you see Salim’s house. A vehicle is a big thing. Something all of us would see. You did not see a vehicle there. A white vehicle belonging to Fuat.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see. I did not see at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You did not see.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Well, did you see any of Salim’s children, his daughters, at that time?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. I did not see. There was no one at that time.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Even if there was, I did not see.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You entered inside.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How many minutes did you stay inside?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : For example, you say “We entered inside”; you tell me all the doors were closed. He took us to a room. You said Narin’s lifeless body was on the floor in the room. Yes. When you saw Narin’s lifeless body, what was your reaction?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : A bit — I saw it. Then I was afraid. I hesitated a bit.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What did you say to Salim at that moment? The first thing you said. From the moment you saw Narin. The first sentence you said to Salim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You spoke, but you do not remember. You spoke, you do not remember. Was there any problem? Did you ask why this girl was on the floor?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not ask.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Well, in normal life, if such a thing happened, would you not ask?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You do not know. Was it because of the friendship between you that you did not ask?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : If Salim did it or whoever did it, if Salim brought you, did you say there must be a truth here? Did you not think anything?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : At that time I did not think anything.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You did not think anything?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not think.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Alright, you saw. On the floor. Just now when the presiding judge asked, you said he brought the blanket from outside.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He brought it from outside, but I do not know from where he brought it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did he call anyone?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, he did not call anyone.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : His children?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : His daughters?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : His spouse?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Enes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How long did it take for the blanket to arrive?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I will tell you the time you stayed inside the house. That time for us — you enter the house at 15:26. You are inside the house until 15:35. A 9-minute period is normal, is it not? Remember the period you stayed?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Because four minutes later your vehicle appears on the cameras after leaving the house. This is concrete evidence. The moment the red car is captured on camera at :41. From the farm camera. You enter the house at :26. From :26 to :41 you are in that house and around that house. I am talking about the process in that sequence of events you just told the presiding judge. That is, 15 minutes. Did all these happen within those 15 minutes? I will say it again. From inside your house, taking Narin; the blanket arriving; wrapping in the blanket; taking the slippers from the door; and after leaving the house we add the time to hand over the blanket as well. Because you came toward your house. Is it 15 minutes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember, I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you not remember the time, or do you not want to remember?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember the time.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You do not remember the time. Alright, you are inside the house. You took Narin. While Narin was lying on the floor, where was the bag?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The bag was on her neck.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The bag was on her neck like that?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It was on her neck.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Well, do you remember whether the bag was open or closed?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It was closed.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you then feel the need to look?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But when you took the slippers when you went outside, did you keep the bag on Narin’s neck in the same way?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I threw the slippers into it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : For example, how did you throw them into it? Did you open the blanket again?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Tell us, for example, show us — you say, for example, the blanket; you say you wrapped it with Salim, right? You wrapped it with Salim; the blanket came from outside. Did you spread the blanket on the floor or did you hold the blanket in your arms?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I held the blanket in my arms.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How did Salim assist you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He only took it out of the house.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, no — while wrapping in the blanket, how did Salim assist you? Tell us how you wrapped it.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I held this side of the blanket once.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You held it.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He saw me there as well. He turned, turned from the stairs, turned to me.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes. You two held from one end and placed into the blanket. Did you wrap inside?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : We had not fully wrapped; we had just folded it normally with the slippers.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Are the two of you going out together holding it, or are you alone?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The two of us — alone — we went out together.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When did he tell you to put the slippers inside as well?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He told me at the door to put the slippers inside.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you think he saw them at that moment or earlier? Did he tell you to put the slippers inside before seeing them at the door, or did he also see the slippers?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He saw them.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You looked there. Other than those slippers, did you not see anything else, shoes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There were, there were, old ones.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How many, for example?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : For small children or big ones? Pardon, for adults? For a girl or a boy? Were the shoes standing in front of the door like that, sports shoes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You do not remember. Alright. You took Narin from there — did Salim then come outside or did he go back inside again?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : While I was walking there, I do not know, truly, I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But let me remind you of one of your statements. You say, “As I was going toward the vehicle, he came behind me by car.” Is this information correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, after I went down and went next to the car, he came.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You took Narin, you are going with her in your arms, you are going toward the house. Because your vehicle is there, your vehicle is there, you are going.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In your statement you say: “Salim came behind me with his vehicle.” In your earlier statements.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How did he come? Did he come on foot? That is, did he walk behind you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He came by car.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That is what I am asking. With which car? The white car standing in front of the house. It was standing in front of the house. You saw it when you went out. Then if the vehicle in front of Salim’s house moved, by which way would it come next to your car?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : There are two roads. There is one road.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You saw him coming from behind by car. By which road did he come?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He came through the village interior.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So not the one toward the school?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The one inside the village.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The village, from the back. You exited the house at thirty-six past (15:36).​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Then how long would it take for him to come to you from there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I truly do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Normally, for example, how many years have you lived in that village?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I am 52 years old. I have lived in that village for 52 years.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Have you ever ridden in Salim’s car before? Not this Renault. In his car that had an accident, for example. Or in earlier years, in his car. How long would it take for him to come from in front of his house to the house you mentioned?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I do not know approximately.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you not have an estimate? Three minutes, five minutes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I cannot say it definitively.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But he came there by car. He came there by car. Why did he turn and come to the front of your house? How did he turn his direction toward your vehicle?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He did not turn. He came and stopped there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Then would the camera in front of the school not see him?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It would not.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did he enter from the turnoff to your house before reaching the place where Narin was last seen?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. He came from the mosque side.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : On which side is the road to your house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It is on the upper side.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The left. When we face the school, it is on the left.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, the left.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He came — before reaching the school, did Salim’s vehicle turn toward your house? Not on the school side.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He came from the mosque side.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, no. He is not going toward the school either. Did he turn from the mosque and come toward your house? Did he come from the back?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He came from the back.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Alright. And you handed the blanket over to him there.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Was Ramazan Atasoy there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Was Mehmet Selim Atasoy there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, no one saw.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : They did not get in the car with you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When you took Narin?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I was alone.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You handed the blanket to Salim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You handled the blanket for a long time, did you not? For example, tell us about the blanket. What was its color? What was its shape? Did it have a pattern on it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : At that time, I mean, I do not remember much.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you remember the clothes Salim was wearing?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There was a T-shirt.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What color was it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember the color.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The blanket is larger than that T-shirt. Do you not remember the color?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember the color at the moment.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You looked at it at length, you placed Narin inside it, you folded it. You came and, from the ceiling of your house above, you lowered it down, from the window. You still have the blanket. That is your assertion. You still have the blanket.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had left the blanket next to the car. After he came, I took it to him.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, no — you took Narin upstairs, you took her into your house, as you told the Presiding Judge, you said you passed the sack down over her head. You lowered her from above. What did you do with the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I took the blanket next to the car.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, no — upstairs, upstairs. You did not take Narin in front of your house without the blanket. You did not take her to the barn. You have the blanket, Narin is inside. You lowered Narin into the barn from the window. What did you do with the blanket? Let me state that moment. But where is the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I took the blanket, together with the body, next to the car.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, you lowered the body down from upstairs — because as far as I understand, there is a sort of chute in your barn upstairs.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You threw Narin down through that chute.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I lowered her slowly.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you lowered her slowly. Then did you lower her down together with the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That is what I am asking. You lowered her down together with the blanket. You went down, went to the barn, put her into the sack. You did not tie the mouth of the sack. How did you carry the sack? On your shoulder, on your back, in your arms, under your arm?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The blanket. I carried her with the blanket.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : With the blanket in your hand. You came to the vehicle. You saw Salim coming from behind with the vehicle.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I threw the body into the car. Salim had just arrived then.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You placed Narin into the vehicle.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : At that moment you did not leave the blanket inside the vehicle?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not leave it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You are still holding it in your arms.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I had left it next to the car.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Well then, did you know Salim would come such that you left it outside? If you did not know, for example, you had taken on a responsibility to dispose of Narin, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That is how you state it. If you put Narin inside the vehicle, if you did not know Salim would come, would a person leave a piece of criminal evidence like a blanket next to the vehicle?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : They would not, but I knew he would come.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How did you know? Did he tell you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He did not tell me; I mean, I assumed. I knew he would come for the blanket.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : While you were there, in the house, did he tell you he would take the blanket from you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He did not say so. I knew he would come.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Then did you think he would come at that moment, or that he would come to the location, that is, to Eğertutmaz Stream where you went?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not think of that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You had a feeling that he would come directly to the front of the house. Where did you get this feeling? For example, I am asking this with a comment — with a comment together with a question, Your Honor. After I hand over a body to someone, I would not make contact anymore thinking I have rid myself of that body. Could it not be that Salim had such a feeling when he handed it to you? Or if not, then in some way, directly or indirectly, he must have made you feel that he would come to you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He came, you put it down at that moment. Salim came; Narin is in the sack, in the car, on the floor mat area of the back seat. Did Salim ask you where you put it? Did he ask what you put it into?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, he did not. We did not have such a conversation.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : At that moment did he not ask where in the car it was?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He did not ask. I had already put it into the car.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you think he saw it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He did not see that I put it into the car at that time.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He did not see?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He did not see. That is, he took the blanket next to the car, he took the blanket from me and took it away. I do not know anything else.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In your opinion — he is your friend of 30 years — what might Salim have done with that blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you think he gave it to someone, like you did?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Could he have given it to Ramazan?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Could he have given it to Mehmet Selim Atasoy?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You have no information on this.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You went, you took, you went to the stream. At that moment at the stream — I also watched your videos. That is, together with our prosecutors, I watched the video at the scene where you placed Narin into that puddle of water. I will ask you something. At that moment what was the level of the water down below? I am asking about the water flowing from Eğertutmaz stream. Was the water of Eğertutmaz overflowing toward the place where you buried her, or was there no water there? Because I am not speaking of the water here. Because you — let me explain to you — when you went for evidence determination, pardon, for site inspection, when Narin was found there was water in the pit where Narin was found. But when you went, apart from that water, you know there is an earthen part between that small area and the stream bed where the water flows. Was that under water?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : That part was not under water.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did your foot, did your foot touch any water?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There was water there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That is what I am asking. You hid Narin in a small place, in a small hollow. I am saying you placed her there outside, while you are outside. Were your feet in the water at that moment? I am speaking of the water outside that puddle.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : They were in the water.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What was the level? From your legs — that is, up to where from your feet?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It was about 50 centimeters. I mean about 40 centimeters.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I will ask something. You left the village at 15:41. When we subtract the time you arrived in the neighborhood, I may be mistaken, it is a period of 5–6 minutes. In terms of that period my colleagues can also remind us. I am asking this. We are talking about a period of 38 minutes in this neighborhood. Let us accept each of them as a maximum of 4 minutes — from where you parked the vehicle to where you left Narin. Four there, four back — 8 minutes. What did you do there for 30 minutes? For example, 30 minutes — there is a ready pit there. There is water. You placed her into the water. According to your statements — I say this in quotation marks — you have no effort at camouflage to conceal. Because you said so. For example, you said, “I did not place those branches.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not place them.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said, “I placed one stone.” For example, three stones came up. Then at that moment, during that period, because of the height of the water, did you dive into the water, did you take off your clothes and leave them outside? Did you go with shoes and trousers?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, the water was not that high.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you take off your clothes? You did not?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not take them off.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you take off your shoes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you take off your trousers?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : After how many minutes did you arrive at Zeynep’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You left there and directly — cheese. Your spouse tells you, you spoke at 15:08. You are leaving from the house, from the vehicle. She says “Bring cheese from Zeynep’s” when you come in the evening.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You went to Zeynep’s to get cheese in the evening. After you buried Narin. Where are their house? In Uzunbahçe, right? What is the distance between Uzunbahçe and Eğertutmaz?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How many kilometers?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know the distance.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Have you never gone before?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had gone before but I do not know the distance.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How many minutes did it take when you went before?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know, I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But you went there directly.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, from there — as soon as I left it, from there we said.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You went to Zeynep’s house, sat, drank tea; they were eating. They wanted to offer you a meal; you did not accept; you drank tea.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Meal and so on.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But you drank tea.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I drank tea.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Well, you entered the water. At most half an hour.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not enter the water.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You just said that when you placed Narin into that pit the water level was high?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I said it was not high.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did I misunderstand? You seemed to say it was high.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : That is what I said.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said forty–fifty centimeters. Show us forty–fifty centimeters. In your view, how much is forty–fifty centimeters? You went into the water up to your knees.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not go in. I did not enter the water at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You took off your trousers.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not take off my trousers either; there was a stone there. I said I did not enter the water.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He said he did not enter the water. He said he did not remove any clothing. Ask again so we can confirm.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not enter the water at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The 40–50 centimeter water level — where is that water level? You mentioned a 40–50 centimeter water level. You said it was high.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, that is how I put it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Then did you build a bridge so as not to touch that water? Did you leave her like this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There was a stone, a stone. There was a stone there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let us understand each other well, Nevzat. Let us understand well. I will explain again. You went down that slope. You have Narin under your arm. You went down. In your mind, where did you plan to bury her earlier?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Because I deemed that place suitable, I left her there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Where did you think this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I went — there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You left the house. Did you plan a place in your mind after leaving the house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. I did not plan at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You are a fisherman as well, I think? Am I remembering wrong?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I am not a good fisherman.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But you fish there.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. I have never gone there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But you know that stream well.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I know it. I had gone to fish further down.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Had you ever gone before to the place where you buried — rather, where you hid — her?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, I had passed by there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you know there was that pit there? Because it is enclosed. Like a…​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not know before. I went — as there was a pit — I left her there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now I watched that video as well. When you go to that stream, that is the only place where one can put something, the only place one can descend. Correct? Is that why you descended there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I deemed that place suitable. I left her there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What was the reason you deemed that place suitable?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I left her there. I mean… I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I will ask again. Between the place of the pit and the place where the water of Eğertutmaz stream flows — the stream bed — there is an earthen distance. It is green, grassy.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, it is grassy.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Weedy. When you went there, were those grasses in the water?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : In the water… I mean no, they were not much in the water.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So when you buried — pardon, hid — Narin, you did not get wet at all?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. Only — I mean… I had slippers on my feet.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Slippers? Or shoes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had slippers. Not shoes. Summer slippers.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Summer slippers. Were they on your feet all day?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean not all day. When it is hot, I…​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you generally walk outside in slippers. That is, you did not put on slippers because you were going to Eğertutmaz in this incident.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Alright. But your trousers did not get wet. You pulled them up.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. They did not get wet at all. Yes. I did not enter the water.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You waited there for thirty-eight minutes.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In 38 minutes — again I am speaking based on your statements — let me tell you the time you lost with the leg of Narin. Second, the allegations in that sense are correct — you tried to tie the mouth of the sack with the lace of Narin’s red bag. I know you were there for 38 minutes. The court knows too. Because there is undisputed digital material. Your vehicle comes, stops, you go, you get in. These are ascertained. 38 minutes. Know it as well. 38 minutes. In 38 minutes, while you were hiding Narin there, you left her even though you saw that her leg remained outside.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I left it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you not say — it will remain outside, a living creature will come, pull it, catch the scent, bring it out. My apologies, Mr. Arif. Did such a feeling not develop in you? You live in a village, you are a farmer, you know there are many animals in your village, there are dogs. There are many, are there not, stray dogs?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not think at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let me ask something. Do you think later someone went there and might have opened the bag you tied properly — the sack you tied properly?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you think Ramazan might have gone there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Mehmet Selim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Salim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : They did not go?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I mean, they may have gone. I did not see.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Why are there three stones, in your opinion?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You placed one stone, right?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had placed one stone.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You placed one stone?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had placed one stone.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You did not place brushwood?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When it was found, there were three stones, there was brushwood. Who knows of that place other than you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : What do you mean?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Other than you — who knows that you hid Narin there, other than you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, I…​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Salim knows?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, Salim knows.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But he does not know the exact spot, right?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He does not know the exact spot.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He does not know the exact spot. Now let us come — I will ask more explicitly what Madam Prosecutor asked you. The whole Güran family — pardon, not the whole — 6–7 people, I will not list names. After Narin’s disappearance, some on the 22nd, some on the 23rd, deleted all call records on their phones. Do you know what this is?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, no — you know what it is, do you not? You know what it is to delete records. Whoever you called, you delete like this.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, I do not know that — I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, no — you know this technical matter, do you not?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You do. On Salim’s phone — I am opening it now — all the records he deleted have been restored.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Those he did not delete are already on his phone; those he deleted have been restored. Especially WhatsApp.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : WhatsApp. It has been restored — this is evidence, concrete evidence, a finding. In the file before us, I am not speaking of the narrowed base station data signed by the experts. Concrete — on Salim’s phone, on his device, they restored all the records, the records he deleted.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You have no information on this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : At 15:46 you called him — pardon, at 17:46 you called him?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know — I mean I do not know that I called. I only called at 15:08.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : There is no issue with that — that is a normal call; that has not been deleted. It is on the record, it is on the phone. At 17:46 — look, this is recent; this matter is also in the indictment. At 17 — let me not tell you wrong again. At 17:46 and 32 seconds, you have a 41-second phone call.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What did he say to you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did he say “Do not call me again”?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I do not know, I mean.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Technical, technical — you do not remember.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember, that is.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What is Vecdi to you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Vecdi — Vecdi is my brother.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Older than you or younger?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Younger than me.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Does he have another name among the public? That is, for example, do you have a name you use for Vecdi, other than Vecdi Bahtiyar, within the family, within the village?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Truly — I mean, no. No, it is Vecdi — he has no other name.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Then let me give you one more piece of information. Why would Vecdi, your brother, be saved as Vehbi on Salim’s phone? Do you know? Do you know such a name? Pardon me — pardon — as Vedat. As Vedat. Mr. Salim, you also said here that he has another name. Is it Vedat? Is there a name known among everyone as Vedat?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : His name — in the identity — is Vecdi. Normally we say Vedat.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That is what I am asking you — Vedat. Vedat was in Hatay that day, you know that, right? For construction work.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How many times did you speak with Vedat?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You spoke.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean speaking — I do not know, that is. There may have been a conversation — I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What did you talk about? You took a child. Let us show a bit of conscience. You took a child to the stream bed. You took an eight-year-old child to the stream bed. You hid her in that pit. What could you talk about with your elder brother? The Presiding Judge asked you. You have not killed anyone in your life.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I spoke with no one. I have not spoken with anyone about this.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What did you talk about with Vecdi? I am asking. Vecdi — you called Vecdi.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know — I mean even if I spoke with him, I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Vecdi called you at 06:34 on the morning Narin was found.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did he call or not?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : At 06:34 in the morning. After Vecdi returned from Hatay — his house is in Çarıklı, in Çarıklı, right?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He stays at his house in Çarıklı. From his house in Çarıklı is Eğertutmaz stream visible? Think — I do not know either.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It is not visible.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But he called you at 06:34.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know, I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you ever hear what time the search for Narin started there?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When you looked from your own house did you see it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not see at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Vecdi did not call you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I did not call.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Vecdi did not call you at 06:34?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I am asking for the last time.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He may have called, I mean, maybe — I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How is the relationship between Vecdi and Salim?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Their relationship — I mean it was normal.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do they have a relationship like the one you have with him? Are they friends? Companions?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Friends — I mean normal, they grew up together in the village, like two people, like that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I will tell you one more concrete piece of evidence. You call Salim at 17:46. You call him — I am speaking according to the records, according to base station records you call him. And then, setting aside Narin’s matter, according to your friendship you never call Salim again in any way. Salim does not call you either. Let me ask you a question. Salim denies all your claims, does he not? You must have heard.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He denies them.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I will ask you a question. I will ask this to Salim as well. Someone you are this close with, someone who is your friend. If truly what you say is “not true,” as Salim says — in quotation marks — how many times would he call you saying “Narin is missing”? He would call and say “Let us search together,” right?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Suppose someone really abducted Narin that day. That white vehicle they mention, spinning its wheels. Abducts her from the village.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : We already searched in the village.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, no, I am not talking about searching for Narin. For example, I came and abducted Narin. I took her from the village, I abducted Narin. Under normal circumstances would Salim not say to you, “Hey Nevzat, they abducted my niece in the village, come on”? He would call you, would he not?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, he would call.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You would search together. You would call every day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment, I think there is an objection to the question. Go ahead.​\n\n\nDefense Counsel : We think there is insistent leading in this question. It was asked twice — “he would call, right?”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then let us ask whether he would call in the ordinary course of your daily life.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Of course, that is what I asked.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Would he call in the ordinary course of your daily life?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I abducted her. Under normal circumstances, if someone from outside had abducted Narin, your 30-year friend, someone at whose house you stayed — because of this abduction, aside from family members with whom he would be most in contact, you would be the person. That is what I am asking, right?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, it is not only me he knows — everything in the village is the same.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But you have that relationship.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean everyone in the village is the same way. I am not the only one.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Is it normal that he never called you even once? In your opinion?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, not “I do not remember.” I am asking another opinion question. Under normal circumstances, for missing Narin to be found, Salim should be calling you constantly, right? Because you are his close friend — that is what I am asking.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He should be calling constantly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let us not ask opinion questions.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Not an opinion — because now I will ask about a piece of evidence.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, let us ask about evidence.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He never called you. He never made contact with you. Do you think he would make contact with Vecdi?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not think so.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You do not think so. On 08/22/2024, the day after Narin was found — 10:21; 08/22/2024, 17:02; 08/22/2024, 22:41; 08/23/2024, 12:32 — Vecdi spoke with Salim 4 times, and what a coincidence, in all calls it was Vecdi who called. Do you think they have a relationship?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean he may have called him because of the girl. After she went missing.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In all of them he calls you beforehand as well.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The information he got from you — the information he got from you — are you communicating through Vecdi? There is sequential calling.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you know what sequential calling is? I call you. Ten minutes later, an hour later, I call Mr. Aydın. Was Vecdi your bridge communication?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, nothing like that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He was not.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Is Fadile your daughter?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Have you ever talked about this incident with Fadile?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have never talked.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Have you ever heard the statements given by Fadile?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have never heard.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Have you read the statements in this file?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Who said what?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have never read. I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : For example, Enes says about you: “He is a very insignificant person, very quiet, very open to being led. If Salim tells him to do something, he will do it,” a sentence like that.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : We were friends.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So this information is true. Everyone in the village knows you like this.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, in the village we loved each other. I mean Salim.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : After confirming this, I will tell you your daughter’s statement. You have never heard your daughter’s statement.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I have never heard.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yüksel, Narin’s mother — from the moment she “learned” Narin had gone missing, in her own statement, she heads toward your house and says the following: “Wherever you left my daughter, whoever took my daughter, bring her and leave her in a corner. At least let there be a grave.” In those 19 days — since you were out during those 19 days — did she say anything like this to you on the day Narin went missing?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : She did not. But there were constant conversations in the village. Going to your house — I do not know that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You do not know this information; your daughter did not tell you this in any way within those 19 days?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember, I do not know. All the villages were talking about this matter. Whoever took her, let them bring and leave her somewhere. There was such talk, but I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Your Honor, let me check, one moment.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course. This is turning into repetitive questioning, but there is nothing to do. We struggle while taking statements; therefore we will at least continue with repetitive questions regarding Nevzat. But let us be careful about repetitive questions regarding Salim or the others — I asked half of them too but we are getting nothing, or “I remember,” “I do not remember.” Look at your notes, Mr. President; otherwise let us give the floor to the next colleagues.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Your Honor, that is all my questions to Nevzat for now.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, is there anyone who wishes to ask questions from you?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Pardon, Your Honor — on this matter, I apologize, I am very sorry, because I was present at the autopsy, I will ask something. I apologize, my colleagues perhaps cannot describe it — before we began the autopsy procedure, during evidence determination, a hook was found inside the sack. Jet-black with a metal-wood appearance, and since it remained in the stream bed, its nature was also reflected in the forensic medicine report. Do you have such a hook — because that sack is yours. From the serial numbers it is clear it matched the fertilizer sacks in your other barn. We are certain on this. In that sack, when you took that sack, were the sacks stacked or was there something inside at some place?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I — something inside — I do not know, I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Because there was a piece of metal that did not belong to Narin either?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir ​\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Mr. Nevzat, did you strangle Narin?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Then who strangled her?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Salim.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Salim — how do you know?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He told me himself.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did he say he strangled her himself, or did he say someone strangled her — take and hide her?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He said: “I strangled her.”​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did he ever explain how he strangled her? Did you ask?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We asked these, but everything is from scratch.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : It will not be from scratch.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You will bring it to a point, tie it together; I understand, but at least refer to our statements — “Look, you said such and such, alright?” Please introduce the topic.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Who threatened you with a gun? In the first section when the presiding judge asked you a question, you said, “They threatened me with a gun.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Salim.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : No, I am asking this: “I was afraid, they threatened me with a gun, so I did not give a statement.” At that point you did not give a name.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Counsel, I asked that. He said he threatened him with a gun at the house.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Again Salim, alright. Who offered money to your brother? Your brother came to the prison and told you, “They offered me money and land.” Who offered this to your brother?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I do not know from whom my brother learned it.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did he not tell you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He told me. When he came to visit me. He said such a phrase to me, but—​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : What did they offer?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He said — let him come and talk to — there was Hacı Hasan. Probably Salim’s uncle — he had said to him.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Which uncle?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Hacı Rıza Güran.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : What did he say?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know what they said.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Of course, of course.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He told Hacı Hasan: “Go tell him — if he wants, let us give such an amount of money, a piece of land; then let us make his house good.” They said something like that — I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Your brother told this to you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, our brother.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : And Rıza Güran offered it to him through intermediaries?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : I am asking what he told you. Alright. Do you have any enmity with Arif Güran?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We asked this question, Counsel. Please, please. Bring it directly to that point — there was no enmity between you.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : I will state it immediately.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Look, let us do this — in your earlier statement you said “There was no enmity between us,” ask your question.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Alright, Your Honor.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : So, the family has a claim about Nevzat as follows: “Previously we called Nevzat a stutterer; because he is a stutterer we made fun of him over his stutter, and therefore he killed our daughter,” a claim like that. Did anyone make fun of you like this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Well, before this incident — that is, before Narin’s incident, before the day of the incident — did Salim ever say to you, “I will kill Narin”?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : On the day Salim was arrested — do you know Süveyla Özkan?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I know.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did Süveyla Özkan say to your spouse and your family, “Salim has been arrested; they will arrest Nevzat as well”?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Was there such a statement with your spouse?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did you talk with your spouse about this incident? Did you give no information after the incident?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did you take the body there alone? Well, it has been determined that one leg of the body was severed, or that it was torn by animals.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : In your first statement you said, “At first Salim told me to cut up the body.” Did you ever cut up the body?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not touch it at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Was the leg severed?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember — I mean the leg was not severed or anything.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You do not remember.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean the leg was not severed.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : It was not severed.​\n\n\nIt was heard that the Complainant Arif Güran spoke loudly and said certain words.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Mr. Arif, please. Let someone take you to the restroom. Give him water. Mr. Arif, can you hear me? Alright. Please be a bit calmer. What is this man saying to me? I understand — please, I say. Get some water and splash your face.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Erdem Kaya ​\n\nLaw. Erdem Kaya : Do you know Ramazan Ayla?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Ramazan Ayla — Ramazan Ayla is our son-in-law.​\n\n\nLaw. Erdem Kaya : Yes, he lives in Istanbul.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Ramazan Ayla — no, he lives in Diyarbakır.​\n\n\nLaw. Erdem Kaya : Now, the day after the incident, on August 22, you called three times. On August 23, you called twice. Do you speak this frequently every day?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Truly, I mean on this matter he was calling me. Has the girl been found, I mean what happened?​\n\n\nLaw. Erdem Kaya : When you called, was he in Istanbul? Or in Diyarbakır?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : In Istanbul. I do not remember in Diyarbakır. He called me — he called regarding Narin. I mean, did you find her, what happened? I mean, is there news or not? He called me on that matter.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık ​\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : In one of your earlier statements, Nevzat, you said, “When I first saw Narin there was blood behind her ear.” Can you tell us this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It was not blood. There was a bruise or something. It was either on the left or the right. There was a bruise — there was no blood.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Why did you say blood then?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It had turned red.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : If the Diyarbakır Bar Association is finished, I give the floor to the counsel for Arif Güran.​",

Berat Kocakaya : Did you ever engage in a car trade?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not buy, that is.​\n\n\nLaw. Berat Kocakaya : Was there any talk of money between you regarding a car? Or were you offered money by someone else due to a vehicle transaction? Did you experience any problem in a business dealing?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No problem. We only had an issue with one car.​\n\n\nLaw. Berat Kocakaya : So that means you did business before.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : At that time I did not do any.​\n\n\nLaw. Berat Kocakaya : Can you explain that vehicle? The one with the issue?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The Antakya car. I bought it. It stayed with me for 1–2 months. A problem arose with the registration. Because of the registration I took it back and said I would return the car there. They returned it to the man; there, together with Arif, they sold the car. They sold the car, but we did not know the car was in parts. The chassis number was different, the panels all different. Because of that the man bought it— a friend had bought that car. He had an accident, the man had an accident. Due to the accident the police came. After the inspection they found the car was in pieces.​\n\n\nLaw. Berat Kocakaya : Yes, there was a problem with the car. Well then, did the people you sold it to make any demand of you? From you or from Mr. Arif?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know— they said they issued us an 80,000 lira fine.​\n\n\nLaw. Berat Kocakaya : The people to whom you sold it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I paid 50,000 lira.​\n\n\nLaw. Berat Kocakaya : You paid 50,000 lira.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I paid 50,000 lira; I was going to pay 20,000 lira more.​\n\n\nLaw. Berat Kocakaya : Yes. Because of this 50,000 lira, do you bear any grudge or hostility toward Mr. Arif?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I only spoke with him. He said this phrase to me: he had filed a lawsuit; if he won the case, I would pay the 50,000 lira.​\n\n\nLaw. Berat Kocakaya : That is all? You have no other business dealings? And no grudge because of this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Berat Kocakaya : Alright, thank you.​",

    "text": "Ministry of Family and Social Services ​\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun ​\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : You say you were close friends with Salim Güran. Did you previously know about the relationship between Yüksel Güran and Salim Güran?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : So you learned it that day?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, I learned it that day. I know nothing else.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : But you were very close friends.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, but I know nothing about him.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Well, did Narin see this as a sexual relationship? How did Mr. Salim describe it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know; I have no information about that.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : But he said she saw them while they were having relations, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : He himself said so, but I did not see.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Alright, now you said the last statements taken at the prosecutor’s office are true; however, in the statement dated 09/21/2024 you said, “Her feet did not fit in the sack; I could not tie the mouth of the sack.” Now you say, “I tied the mouth of the sack with the strap of her bag.” Which statement is true?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : While tying the strap, one foot remained outside.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : How could it remain outside?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : After closing it, one foot remained outside. I did not put the foot into the sack. I left it like that.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : So you did not dismember the leg?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : There was no lack of limbs?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : There was a body being carried in the house, talk, threats. Yet according to HTS records Enes and the mother were at home. Did you not hear any noise, argument, conversation in the house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I heard nothing.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : And you did not see anyone. Well then, had you told Mr. Salim beforehand where you would place the body at Eğertutmaz stream?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We asked this too. Anything else?​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Nothing further.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz ​\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : First, I would like to state this sincerely: it may have been asked, but questions are to reach a final goal, because, sir, everyone can see it— the statements are fragmentary; they change. He constantly fails to remember where he ought to remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Please proceed quickly.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : I wish to say this, sir. I consider this very important: according to HTS base records, Yüksel Güran is at home between 14:28 and 15:38, sir. Nevzat Bahtiyar at 15:41— Mr. Nevzat calls Mr. Salim at 15:08; at 15:27 he is at home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Conclusion? Direct question, Counsel.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : May I have the question?​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : The question is this, sir. Because the statements constantly change, we could not draw a conclusion from the HTS records and the statements. The Prosecutor also asked; the President of the Diyarbakır Bar Association also asked, but Salim Güran is at home between 14:52 and 15:19. He goes to the barn, comes and goes constantly; he is at home until 16:10.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Counsel, a question— not a defense.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : At 17:40 he calls him; at 17:46 he calls Salim back via WhatsApp. It has not been clearly explained, sir.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He said “I do not remember; I did not call on WhatsApp.”​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : And, sir, finally he says “I saw no one at home.” When leaving the house, he says “Ms. Yüksel was crying,” sir; there is a contradiction.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now how can I ask “What did you talk about on WhatsApp?” to a man who says, “I do not remember calling on WhatsApp”?​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : But sir, the statements keep changing; we will insistently ask.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I asked 33 times; he asked 33 times as well. He says he did not call on WhatsApp. To a man who says “I did not call,” I cannot say “What did you talk about on WhatsApp?”​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : He says there was only Salim Güran at home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I asked— “I do not know where Yüksel came from; I saw her up on the slope.”​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Enes Güran ​\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek ​\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Nevzat Bahtiyar. Although you did not mention Yüksel Güran in your initial knowledge-giving statements and statements given in the capacity of suspect, is the reason you later spoke of Yüksel Güran that you remembered this very important detail on the date you mentioned it? Or is there some other matter you have not shared with the honorable court, with the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, and with law enforcement?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know. I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : I will narrow it and repeat. Despite not mentioning Yüksel Güran in your earlier sequential statements, is the reason you mentioned Yüksel Güran in your most recent statement— stating you saw her and describing that she was crying— solely because you remembered it at that time? Is it due to that? Within this framework, is there any other matter you have not related?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, there is no other matter.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Alright. You stated that you spoke with no one regarding Narin until the date of your apprehension, including your family.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Alright. Why then, after you were apprehended, did your family members make statements to include alibi evidence concerning you? For example, your first-degree blood relatives gave statements including testimony that on the date of the incident you were doing plaster work at the villa of a person named Derviş in Pirinçlik. Did you direct them in this regard?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : If you did not speak with your family members, why did they feel the need to protect you by creating such a chain of false evidence?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I never spoke with my family— I did not speak with my family at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Very well. On 15.08 (2024) you are the one who initiated the phone call. You called.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I called.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Yes. On August 21, 2024, at exactly what time did you leave your residence? Or leave the Tavşantepe neighborhood? State the time, or as far as you remember.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember the time, that is.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Did you leave in the morning hours?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : In the morning, yes. I had gone to the construction site there. Our— our house construction. I had called the electrician to pull the wiring.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : To your son’s construction?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. I had called the electrician.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Was anyone else with you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, no one else.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : With which vehicle did you go? By what means did you go? A red vehicle with 23 plates.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The red vehicle.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Was this vehicle with you the whole day? Did it change hands? At 11, at 12, and so on.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, it never changed.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : It was with you continuously?​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : As you stated in your earlier testimony, was it parked on the side of your house facing Süveyla Özkan’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Around fifteen or sixteen o’clock?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Alright. You also said, in response to the presiding judge’s question, that after being called you climbed the slope using the path between the school and the far end of your barn.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : From there, I mean, they go back and forth like that.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You also went up from there, did you not? You said when Salim called you.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You went up on foot?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I went a bit from that side of it, that is— alright.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You make the call at 15:08. A 42-second call— it nears 15:09. There is a 3.5–4 minute discrepancy in the school camera— it is not current. So in fact, around 15:11, Narin is climbing the slope— she climbed or finished. How is it that you did not encounter her? You would also have to be climbing that slope around 15:10.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I— I did not see her.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : At the okra field by Arif’s house-barn annex, in front of the balcony, between Salim’s and Arif’s houses— did you see or hear Narin and a child with Narin, or another person’s voices or movements?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Did you go straight? That is, you climbed the slope, straight ahead?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Straight.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You did not see any other person?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I saw no one else.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Yes. Then, while visits were being conducted— I mean during the time you were in prison— especially your brothers, your brother Mehmet Bahtiyar and your brother known as Vecdi/Vedat— did they convey to you only information they had learned from outside?​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : For example, did they tell you why they made false statements about you in the early stages and later changed their statements step by step toward the truth? Or did you speak in a reciprocal dialogue?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : They only came and— asked after my well-being. On this matter— I mean, we talked together about no other matter. I mean, only— how are you, are you well— my family— I especially wanted— let me see my family, let me see my family. I mean, for no other reason— I did not come there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment, let us take this part again. It was a bit fragmented. Would you repeat?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : How, Your Honor?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That is, none of the family members had ordinary routine conversations with you, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, they came there to visit— to visit me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : They came to visit you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. I mean, about any other matter— I do not know— only that offer— only that, they said— and nothing else, that is.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : They made a money offer?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean, nothing else, alright.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Mr. Nevzat, why then did your spouse, Ms. Gazal, say that you left the house by car immediately after the 15:08 call?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : She had no knowledge of it. I mean, at the back, in the backyard— she did not know I was there. I was there.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : During your law enforcement statement, did you encounter any unusual pressure or ill-treatment?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Then we may assume that your statements at that time— and your behaviors reflected in the scene reconstruction report and its footage— were made of your free will as here.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We will not assume; we asked— and he said yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You asked very well.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He said yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Mr. Nevzat, how afraid are you of Salim? How much would you fear him?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean— because of that— I was a bit hesitant, I was afraid. Otherwise, we have no other fear.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Why has your fear of Salim now passed? You are now able to make more detailed statements.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : After everything came to light, the fear is gone.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You said you were under the effect of fear when giving your initial statements.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : That is correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Then despite your fear, why did you speak about Salim? You said Salim killed the child.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : At that moment as well— at that moment, were you not afraid that Salim could do you harm or have harm done to you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not think of it.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Your Honor, thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you, Counsel.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir ​\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Now first, in his statement he says there was no one there other than the family. Does Nevzat have any kinship with the former mukhtar?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : None at all, near or distant—any kinship on your mother’s side, any connection?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Now he says he went to the house in the incident. So should we understand it like this? Salim killed her. The body is in the house. He goes outside. Is he going out to look for you? Why did he go out? Did you talk about this on the phone?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. We did not talk at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Alright, you took the body. In your earlier statement you said this: At home, my mother was at home. My children were at home. My wife was at home. The place you called the barn window of your house is actually the roof. You threw the child from the roof. Naturally there should be a sound. Was there no sound? Did no one hear?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : No one hears. So there was no sound.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : I see. Alright, you took the sack. Then how did you enter from the house to the barn?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : From there— from that place I entered. In our garden we planted eggplants and so on. From there, from there to the barn.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Is there an entrance to the barn from there? When we looked from there, we did not see any entrance door to the barn.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : From there, from above, I went down into the garden. I went to the vegetable garden. Eggplants and so on. From there I went through the door.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : From the back side— from there, did you not enter the barn through the door?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, not through the door. I entered through the window at the back.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : You also entered through the window.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Through the window.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : There is a window there and you entered through that window?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why did you enter through the window then? Why through the window?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Through the window— I mean I entered from there. I said if I go from the front perhaps someone will see. Because of that I went from the back and through the window there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did Salim tell you to do this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why were you afraid someone would see you? I mean, why did you make such a plan saying someone might see?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean someone from my family might see, because my wife was at home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I asked that. Your mother was at home as well?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My mother was down below.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. You did this so they would not see.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : How high is the window from the ground? A window you can pass through comfortably?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : I see. Alright, you called at 15:08. You talked about water, correct? You called Salim at 15:08.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : What were you doing at that time? Why did you feel the need to call? How did the water issue come up? You never explained this. Was there no water at home? So what exactly were you doing at that moment?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : At that moment— there was no other water. I told my wife our water was coming, our water is not coming. Then I called Salim. Let them come, let the crew come and check. What is the reason, that is?​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : I think I was not understood; I will ask again. Now, you went to your son’s house in Tavşantepe to work. You came home for lunch. It is written like this in your statement.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes. I had come for lunch.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Did you eat?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I ate.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Did you call Salim after lunch?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : After lunch.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So did you need water to wash your hands? Why was there a need for water? I do not understand— why?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : To water the garden, the trees.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : But the hose was already attached to water the trees, right?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had drawn that water from my mother’s.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Was there water in the house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There was water in the house.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Then your water at home was not cut off?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was taking from my mother’s. Because there was water.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : I do not understand.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The counsel is asking this. In the taps in the house, was water flowing? That is the question.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, it was not flowing.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Alright. So you called at 15:08. Lunch and such were over. You called. You have no water. Then did you go out immediately afterward? Or did you sit?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So did you not go out to water the garden immediately?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did go out.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Let us also clarify the garden.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I went out to water.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Let us clarify the garden, so there is no question mark. In front of your house there is a place with a mulberry tree.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : And there is also a place at the back with eggplants. Yes. Which did you water?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Uh, the mulberry tree one.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : A moment ago you said eggplants. When first asked by the panel you said the place with the eggplants.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Eggplants first— not first. I mean from there— I had gone into the eggplants. There— watering— not watering the eggplants. When there were eggplants I had gone there. I mean I did not see my wife.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So let me ask clearly as I understand it. After you spoke at 15:08, did you go to the eggplants or to the place with the mulberries? You need to remember.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember that. I mean as far as I know, finally— I had gone out into the courtyard.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Now since in your house we do not know the courtyard, we do not know where you went— when you pull the hose, from where is the hose turned on? You also need to turn it on. Is the hose in the back? In the front? I mean on the side with the eggplants.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. I mean the hose was on the side of the mulberry trees.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Then where was the end— the end with which you would water? I am asking this for the following reason. If you went out at 15:08 and you were at the eggplants, there is no possibility you would not see Narin.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Well— I did not see Narin. Now if I had seen, I would say I saw.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Alright, we will not accept it. We will in any case explain this narrowed HTS shortly. According to the HTS, after you spoke at 15:08, at 15:10 it says you were in the area between Arif’s and Salim’s. By which route did you go up?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I— from that side— I went up. The eggplants.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So you went up the footpath? I understand. Alright, that sack, the thing— you walked with it in your hand in an open area. Where was your car parked?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My car was down below.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Where? Where in relation to your house? I mean how far from your door? Was it flush? So when you enter your barn, as we understand, from above there is a flue. There is a window. What else is there? A door?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There is a door on the inside.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Where does it open to? Where is the place you call the courtyard? Your house? Your mother’s house? The place with the mulberry tree?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Alright, very good. Then the place with the mulberry tree— is it visible from inside your house? Can you see the place you call the courtyard from inside your house? From the window, from the door?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : We can see.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Alright. You took the body, put it into a sack. How did you go out with it? From where did you exit? I mean did you exit through the door? Did you exit through the door of the courtyard?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I exited through the courtyard door.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Then did you turn back and take the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I went out together with the blanket.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : You went out together. No one in the house saw you at that moment. Was there no sound while looking for the sack? You had thrown the child. You yourself entered through that narrow space. There was no sound at all during this? Here you say “my wife not like that,” but in her statement taken on 08/10/2024 your wife says: “After Nevzat called, he said he would water the trees and went out. He got into the car. I also went out after him. I saw him descend to the lower road.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Is your wife lying?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I— such a thing— did I not go?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have the right not to answer this question. The spouse who is a witness may face an investigation. One does not ask “Is she lying?”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, you will not answer this question. No, no, no— this would put Gazal in the status of suspect, Counsel; this cannot be.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Anyone else among Enes’s counsel who wishes to ask? Alright. I have finished with Enes’s counsel. Thank you. We may take questions from Yüksel’s counsel. Please.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsels for Yüksel Güran ​\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu ​\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Thanks to our colleagues and to you, virtually all possible questions were asked. We only want you to explain one point very clearly. Nevzat Bahtiyar, the patience of all Turkey has run out.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : True.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Please answer truthfully. When departing from your house, does Salim Güran’s house come first or Arif Güran’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not fully understand, that is.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When you leave your house and want to go to Salim Güran’s house, does Arif Güran’s house come first or Salim Güran’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Arif Güran’s house comes first.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : According to the narrowed base report, which we will later object to, you passed Arif Güran’s house at 15:10 and you are seen on the footpath between Salim Güran’s and Arif Güran’s houses. According to this record, and as determined by the school camera as well, Narin Güran was last seen at 15:11. That is, according to this record, while Narin had not yet reached the house, you are on the footpath. Did you take Narin from that footpath and go to the barn?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You do not accept this record. Not accepting it, correct? You are asking notwithstanding that narrowed report?​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : We are asking notwithstanding acceptance.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Let us begin the sentence that way.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : We are only asking this. Now according to this narrowed base report, based on your movements, you should have seen Narin while she was going on that footpath. Did you not see her at all?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not see at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You did not see at all. Did you love Narin?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Everyone loves Narin.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : I love her too.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My child is the same. She is the same. Everyone’s is the same.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : So you loved Narin.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : She was an ordinary child to me. I love her.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Did Narin have a friendship with your grandchild?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You do not know?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When you bought things for your grandchild, would you ever buy for Narin?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : If she were there, I would buy for her too.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Did you ever give her chips or such?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I never did.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Did you ever say, “Narin, here, this pocket money is yours”?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Alright. My colleague asked a moment ago; we ask again. On the day of the incident, your wife says, “I asked Nevzat to pick up cheese from my sister Zeynep while going.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : That is correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When Nevzat left the house, I was also on the balcony.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : She may have gone out to the balcony— I mean, I—​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : She says she saw you go by car. What do you say to this?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not go. I did not go by car.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Alright. In your earlier questioning you said: “When I went, I saw Narin lying on the floor inside the house. We wrapped her in a blanket and she was handed over to me that way. I went home,” correct? She was handed over to you inside the house.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You say you brought her out together with Salim.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You say you brought her out together with Salim. Then Salim came to take the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : He came down by car, correct? By car? When you left the house— we have now clearly seen Arif Güran’s house from maps— when coming from the barn side it is like a platter— the village square. Correct? It can be seen from everywhere.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : That slope can be seen from everywhere in the village, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean that— I mean, the whole village—​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When going to your barn— when going to the barn from Arif Güran’s house— would no one in the village see that place?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : But there was no one.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : They could see; there was no one. Well then, while Salim had a car, why did you feel the need to carry with a blanket? Would it not have been more practical to put it in the car?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : How do you not know? Better— at least no one would see. What did he refer to when he said it?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He did not see Salim’s car.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Salim comes down by car for the blanket to the barn.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, no— I asked in the first statement. Did you see Salim’s car? He had not seen his car.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : No, I am asking this: If indeed— he takes the lifeless body. Instead of carrying it in his arms all the way to the barn—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I understand what you mean.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Why did you feel the need to carry it in your arms when there was a car?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I had not seen the car.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Where exactly did Salim, by car, take the blanket from you? Exactly where.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Exactly next to the car he took it.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Where was your car?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My car was in front of the gate— that is, on the lower side of the courtyard.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : On the lower side of the courtyard, on the school side. Yes.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The road leading to the school.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : On the side of the road leading to the school. Alright, sir. Thank you.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş ​\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Did you enter the house where Narin Güran was together with Salim Güran? Did you enter Arif Güran’s house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, we entered together.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Did you enter the room together? Narin Güran was on the floor.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : She was on the floor.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : You entered the room.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember which room it was.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : What was in the room? Can you describe the room?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember much. I mean anything— I already do not remember that matter.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : You say an empty room. Let’s describe that.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : From the entrance of the house, which direction did you turn? You do not remember at all.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment, counsel. Now, you entered the house. After you entered, which direction did you head? To the left side or the right side? Did you go straight? Narin’s left side, right? Where was Narin’s body? Which room did you enter?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Honestly I do not clearly remember that. Which room it was.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now I am saying this according to what is stated in the indictment. I am expressly stating the allegation. When Salim Güran entered the house at 15:22, between 15:22 and 15:26 it was in the empty room opposite the kitchen.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Amen.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Sir, we would also like to ask this. There was a vehicle transaction. You had a vehicle transaction with Arif Güran. After a problem arose with the vehicle, it was returned and money was demanded from you. This was asked at the outset. When money was first demanded from you, did you immediately take the money and pay it? Or was some kind of “assembly” formed about this? In colloquial speech, a gathering— who was present in that gathering?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Rükbettin Kaya was there, Cahit Kaya was there.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Yes. How much did they say you had to pay?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There— at first he said 50,000 lira. Then “You will give 40,000 lira.” Salim said, “I will give 10,000–20,000 lira.” He said, “I will give 20,000 and bees.” Eighty thousand lira. Then Salim said, “I am not giving.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : And I said, if he does not give, I mean I will give— I will give 50.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : When Salim did not pay that, you had to pay 50.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I paid the 50.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : How did you pay the money? Where did you obtain it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The landlord first gave 40,000. I got up and sent it. I sent it to Arif. Then for the 10,000 lira I called him. He said, “I’m at a condolence.” I said, “Send me the account number. I’ll transfer 10,000 lira to your account.”​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Did your brother pay the 10,000 lira? Or did you pay it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I sent my brother. Mehmet sent it.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Yes. You did not say that earlier. You said it afterward. Now, in all phases of the investigation you said you were afraid, that you were afraid of Salim Güran— which has been asked here repeatedly.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : You said you could not make any statement regarding reaching Narin Güran’s lifeless body. Since Salim Güran was detained on 09/02/2024, the threat was then removed. You were under no threat.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : For 6 days, over 3,000 personnel, helicopters, 80 drones continued the search. That is, you were in a more secure position. The threat was gone. Why did you not state the location? You still allowed the searches to continue. Or if she had not been found, would you still have stated the location?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean I did not have the opportunity. I could not find the opportunity. To remove her from there.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Yes— if you had found the opportunity on the 8th, you would have removed her. So did you remove her? Did you confess, or did law enforcement find her as a result of their investigation?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : So consequently, you are not the confessor.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I came home. I knew— I knew they would take me. I sat at home, I did not run away. I could have fled. I did not flee.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : So whenever little Narin was found, you would be taken.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I knew this.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : So despite that you did not say it. There was no threat either. Alright sir, thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why did you think of taking the body from there, Nevzat? You said you would hide it. I mean why did you feel the need to hide it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Uh— I thought that— then— I mean I thought to myself. I said why did I leave it there? I mean I would have taken her out of there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You would have taken her out, but there was no opportunity, is that it?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : There was no opportunity.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was going to leave her on a roadway. Someone would come and take her.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you thought she would be found by coincidence, but you could not do it.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I could not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You thought of this yourself. You did not plan it with Salim or anything. Then why did you say “I never thought of fleeing”? I mean why? What was the motive that drove this? Why did you enter such a thought— when thinking “Shall I flee? Shall I not flee?”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, honestly I never thought of fleeing. I also wanted her to be found— I already knew— why?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You knew you would be caught?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes, I knew.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you said there was no need to run?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No need to run. How would I be caught then.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır ​\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Before I proceed to my questions, my condolences to our nation for this heinous incident. Our sole aim is for the full material truth to be revealed transparently in this trial. Everyone is here for that purpose. Now, Mr. Nevzat, in all the statements you have given, you specifically and systematically declare that you were afraid of Salim Güran. But Mr. Salim was detained on 09/02/2024. You also say that after he was detained you felt genuine remorse. Why did you not go and confess during that six-day period?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I never thought of it.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Then there is not, in a real sense, anything— I mean you have no moral unease?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I did not think of it. I only— I was going to leave her on a street, in a road. So they could find her.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Very well. Now, in your statements you said, “I entered the house. I entered Yüksel Güran’s house. After entering the house, I said Narin Güran’s body, her dead body, was in a room on the left.” Now do you remember how many rooms there were on the left?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Alright, you entered the house. Do you remember which room on the left you entered?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Alright. Then, were there any furnishings in the room? Or let us assume there were no furnishings. Did any item in the room that could not be moved catch your attention? Alright then. Now, Your Honor, while reserving our objections to the cell-site records, especially the expert report— yes, we will say it— but let us assume the cell-site records are correct. According to your statement, you took the body and put it in the car. My apologies for saying “body.” You took Narin’s lifeless body and put it in the car. You say when you looked back you saw Yüksel Güran. But in the cell-site records— if they are indeed accurate— at those times and on that date, Yüksel Güran appears to be at home. So how did the situation of seeing her on the slope occur?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I saw her there. I only saw her there. I did not see her inside the house.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : So you clearly remember seeing her on the slope. But that conflicts with the cell-site records. Very well. Now, Your Honor, this will be an external question, but one of the points that drew our attention is this: In some statements by your son İbrahim Bahtiyar and your brother, there is an expression like “Stay away from the Gürans.” But in most of your statements you say “The Gürans are our friends, Salim Güran is my thirty-year friend.” Did you ever make such a statement?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : You did not. Alright, my last question then. Can you tell us about the moment and manner of your arrest? How were you arrested? Where were you arrested? And describe the manner of arrest. Chronologically. Where?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Uh— I was inside the house.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Whose house were you in?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was in my son’s house.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Your son?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : In his house, inside the room.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : About what time was it, do you remember?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Alright— for example, law enforcement came. Gendarmerie personnel came. Did the gendarmerie personnel knock and enter, or had you already heard some noise?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : If I described it wrong, the door was open, that is.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : It was open, the gendarmerie personnel entered directly?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Already from down below how they came— alright. I already knew they were gendarmerie.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Alright, when you saw the gendarmerie personnel, how did you react? Or did you go straight before them, or did you feel the need to hide?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was sitting in the room. They took my son. He said today too— “Dad,” he said— “you come as well.” He said, “Who are you?” I said, “I’m Nevzat.” They took me upstairs.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Alright, I will have one last follow-up. Until that moment, had you considered becoming a confessor, or telling the situation you have described— as we see it? Had you thought of telling it? Or did you decide this after seeing the gendarmerie?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : After seeing the gendarmerie.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : You decided this the moment you saw the gendarmerie?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Alright, thank you.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Doğuş Can Kurucu ​\n\nLaw. Doğuş Can Kurucu : Mr. Nevzat, I have a question for you as well. You know that Mr. Salim’s and Mr. Arif’s houses face each other.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let us take the microphone, counsel. If you take the other microphone, everyone can hear. Hm.​\n\n\nLaw. Doğuş Can Kurucu : You said that Mr. Salim’s and Mr. Arif’s houses face each other. This is clear in the file anyway. As can be clearly seen in the PTS record at 14:33, Mr. Salim arrives home with the children. Given that his house faces Mr. Arif’s, does it make sense to you— as alleged— that after having relations with Yüksel Güran, Mr. Salim killed Narin and handed her to you? Did you ever question this within yourself? Did you not find it odd? Does it not seem odd to you? Did you never question it? No further questions, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He said, “I never questioned it; it does not seem odd.” Alright. I am saying it so that it is properly recorded in the minutes.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Salim Güran ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : When did you last see Narin alive?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So you did not see her alive on the day of the incident?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Had you ever seen her alive before the incident?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know— if I had been at home, maybe I might have seen her, I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did you gather at Salim’s house because of the money matter?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : How?​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did you gather at Salim’s house because of the money matter?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : The meeting was held there, correct?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : When did you gather then? When did you pay the last installment over the stolen car matter? Regarding the car that was returned because of the car issue— the final owner filed a lawsuit. Money was sent because of this matter. When did you pay Arif the last 10,000 TL, that last installment?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Was it recently? Very soon after the child was killed, or months earlier?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : The money matter— when did the meeting occur?​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Was it in 2024? Was it summer, winter, spring? When?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : In 2024. Was it summer? I mean I do not remember whether it was summer. Was it summer?​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : During the incident, at the time of the incident, did you think at all about Arif? Did Arif ever cross your mind? “I am carrying his child, I cannot bear this burden.”​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. I did not think at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : At the time of the incident, were you angry with Arif?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. I was not angry.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When he said he would get your money back, did you trust Arif? That you could get your money?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I trusted him. He was with his wife then.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you believed him.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : If he got it, he would give the money; if not, you had already paid your money.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And you believed this. Very well.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So, Salim asked you for the blanket. Did you not find that odd? I mean, he gave you the child, he gave you the entire body. Did he then come after the blanket?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did you ever go to, or later visit, the place where the child was found— Eğertutmaz stream?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I never went.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : You never went?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I never went.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Not even for a crime-scene indication?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Not at all. I mean for the crime-scene indication, with the gendarmerie— I went at the very end.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Then why, in the nights following the incident, did you not sleep in your own home but slept at your son’s house in Çarıklı? Were you afraid of being taken into custody?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I never slept there. I was always in the village. On the first day, the day I was caught, the roads were already closed. They told us the entrances and exits were closed. Because of that I came to the house in Çarıklı. Otherwise I would have gone to the village. If I had gone to the village, I would have been caught there anyway.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Sir, how was your relationship with Salim before the incident?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It was good.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Then why did Salim not call you on the phone for about two or three months?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did you call him?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I may have called.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did you ever go to the coffeehouse, to play okey, and so on? Did you meet in the village in the context of a closeness, a friendship?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : From time to time he would go to the coffeehouse to play okey, he would go to play okey.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : When did you last go?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The sense here is— did you go to play okey after this incident?​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : No, no. In the three months before the incident.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, I understand that— and did you ever meet at the coffeehouse after the incident?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So you do not think your relationship with Salim was damaged because of the money matter?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. We were talking.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : When the gathering was held, did Salim make you an offer regarding this plaster work?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The offer— I mean there was a house. Yes. His brother had a house. We did not agree. We did not agree on money between us. I did not do it.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So afterward, did Salim and his brother not give you the plaster work for the house they would have built?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The plaster, he did not give me the plaster work.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So did you not talk at all about the plaster? You set a price for the plaster. After that, after quoting a very high price—​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I quoted 150,000 lira.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Ah, so you talked about it because of the plaster matter, right? Was this because of the car matter, then?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No. It was not about the car matter. I said, if you like, speak to Salim. If he wants, I will still do it. I said it was not a matter about the money. I used that phrase.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : On the day of the incident, when you called Salim at 15:08 about the water matter, did you ever ask where Salim was?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, I never asked.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did you ask what Salim was doing?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No, no.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : In her statement, your wife Gazal Bahtiyar said Salim was eating at that time and that he would look into the water matter after eating.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Is your water line the same as your mother’s water line, or separate?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : It is the same. The same. But since theirs is lower, theirs comes, ours does not.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Is your water line the same as the village’s water line, or separate?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : The same.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Now, that day no one’s water was cut. Why was your water cut? Why did you call Salim for water?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Our water was not coming anyway. That is why I called. I mean, for the network personnel to come and take a look. I mean, was it clogged or what? Why is it not coming? Because of that I called him.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Now why are you afraid of Salim? Had you ever seen Salim commit any offense before? Beating someone, resisting someone, exercising dominance, or did he ever threaten you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not want to speak on that matter.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : You do not want to speak. Is your family and the family of Gazal Bahtiyar a large family? That is, is your family in Çarıklı a large family, or a small nuclear family?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Ordinary, I mean. We are eight siblings.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : You are eight siblings. All adults, right? Yes. And where does Gazal Bahtiyar’s family live? Her brothers, those who are village guards? Are they a large family?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : A large family.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : A large family. When you are in trouble, when someone threatens you, when someone wants to make you do something you do not want to do, would your brothers not come to your aid? Or would Gazal Bahtiyar’s family not come to your aid?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : My brothers would come, but my brothers-in-law— I do not think so.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : How would your brothers come?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : One of the brothers would come, the uncles would come.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Whose brothers would come?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I mean if I had a— I mean if something happened in the city— my brothers would come.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ah, your brothers would come, yes?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Alright. My uncle would come. I mean who else would come.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Alright. I ask again to confirm. How many years have you, as a family, been in the village?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : If not idle, 50— 56— 56.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He said since he was born.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Two hours ago it sounded as if you were living in the village like a dependent.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, no, he said since he was born.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : You were not living as a dependent, were you?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I was not living as a dependent, that is.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Let me ask something. Is the Güran family larger, or the Kaya family?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I do not know.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Are there more members of the Güran family or the Kaya family? Now, on the day of the incident you said you borrowed 5,000 lira from someone. From whom did you borrow that money?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : I borrowed it from my brother Mehmet. I mean that.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : You said you took it from Mehmet’s wife.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : What is the name of Mehmet’s wife?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : Ayşe Batu. I took it from her, I mean— I paid the electrician’s fee.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Why, for example, did you not borrow from someone else in the village? Did you need to borrow from Ayşe?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Do you have a romantic relationship with Şeyma Kaya?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Have you ever wanted to strangle someone before? Have you ever tried to strangle someone before?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : I will raise this in my defense. I will mention it over a matter from 4–5 years ago. Again— recall it if you wish. We will address this with our witnesses.​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Mr. Nevzat, did any public official, the JASAT team, or your wife Gazal Bahtiyar prompt you in any way that led you to frequently change your statements?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : That is, you already said what you needed to say. You said you were afraid of Salim, that Salim killed her. Why then did you change some embellishments in your statements? Did you polish some details?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : At that time I was afraid. Mm-hm.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Could Gazal have seen you when you took the child to your barn or your house?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did you tell Gazal about this before you were taken into custody?​\n\n\nNevzat Bahtiyar : No one, no one, no.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Thank you, sir.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you, counsel. Does the defense counsel for the defendant Nevzat have anything to add at this stage? There is nothing to add at this stage. You will make a detailed defense after the opinion.​",

    "title": "Testimony of Enes Güran",
    "section": "Presiding Judge ​",
    "text": "Presiding Judge ​\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, Enes, you have heard the accusations. You are aware of the indictment against you. You know your legal rights. You have a lawyer, you have lawyers. Let me remind you once again of the same matter. You have the right not to answer our questions. You may say, “I am exercising my right to remain silent.” You have the right to express yourself in any way you wish. The microphone is yours; I’m listening. What do you say? You speak, we’ll…​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Should I tell my entire statement?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Start from the beginning, tell whatever you wish to explain.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I came from Arguvan, Malatya. I was an excavator operator. On the 20th of the month, I came home. I arrived home around half past one at night. My father picked me up from the bus terminal. Then my father went up to the roof to sleep. I heated up the meal my mother had prepared for me. I started eating. My mother came down from the roof. She kissed me. While she was heating the meal—sorry, while I was heating the meal—my mother came, she kissed me. She sat for a while. Then she went back up to the roof; I heated my food and ate. In the morning, I woke up around seven-thirty. When I woke up, I saw my mother inside, I saw Muhammed and Eren. I sat with them. Eren came, sat on my lap, we talked together, and later my father Arif Güran, my brother Baran Güran and Narin Güran came down from the roof. After that my mother went to prepare food for us. She cooked, left the meal. Muzaffer Güran came and joined us for lunch. After we ate and everyone got up, I heard that my father and Muzaffer Güran would go to Batman; my father and Muzaffer Güran left for Batman. My brother said he would take his wife shopping. At that time, it was just my mother, Muhammed, Eren and Narin at home. We were sitting, watching TV, the air conditioner was on, it was hot outside, so we didn’t go out. Then I noticed my mother leaving the house, holding a washbasin—we call it “teşti.” Since I came from Arguvan in Malatya, all my clothes were dirty. My mother was taking them to Hediye Güran. I told her okay. She left. Then Muhammed, Eren, Narin and I stayed home. We sat, watched TV. As it got late, we started to call my mother so she could come prepare dinner. Then my mother came later and prepared food for us. Around 12 o’clock we sat for lunch. We ate. After the meal I sat on the couch. Narin came next to me. I was on social media; she was watching me. Then I noticed Narin looking at the clock. When I turned around, she was checking the time. She said to my mother, “It’s one o’clock, mom, I’m late for the mosque, I’ll go.” My mother said, “It’s hot, don’t go today.” Narin said, “Hatice and Fatma are going, so I’ll go too.” My mother said okay, then Narin got up and left. I didn’t see Narin again. Later, since I went to bed late and woke up early, I was very sleepy. After about five minutes, I lay down on the couch and slept. Around four o’clock I woke up. While sleeping, someone had called me—Şahin from Malatya, a friend from Arguvan. He called me while I was asleep and then hung up. Around four I woke up. I saw my mother and Hediye Güran. They were chatting. Muhammed was sleeping. I said to my aunt, “Welcome, aunt.” She said, “Thank you. How are you? Are you well?” I said, “I’m fine. How are you?” She said, “I’m fine.” Then I went outside, went down toward the fountain. There’s a tree next to the grocery shop. I sat there. Then Tahir Kaya came over. We chatted a bit.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : While leaving the house at that time, did you have your phone with you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, my phone was with me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Around 16:00, approximately—exact timing isn’t very important. When you went out at 16:00, your phone was with you.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I was sitting by that tree next to the grocery. Tahir Kaya came to me, we talked. Since it was hot, I wanted to buy an energy drink. I went into the grocery, bought one. I noticed Süleyman Kaya coming in after me. He is mentally disabled; I felt pity and said, “What do you want? Let me get you one too.” He said okay, “Get an energy drink.” I bought one for him as well. I had 200 lira—my father had given it to me that morning before going to Batman. I gave it to the shopkeeper; he gave me the change. When I left the store, I noticed Muhammed Yağmur. I went to him, we talked. Then Kerem Güran and Muhammed Güran (my brother) came. Kerem said, “Welcome, uncle.” While Muhammed and I were talking, Süleyha Güran came. She told Kerem Güran to help carry her hay. Kerem said, “Our backs hurt, we can’t.” Then Süleyha noticed Tahir and walked toward him. Meanwhile, Muhammed Güran and Kerem Güran went down to the lower part of the village, while Muhammed Yağmur and I continued talking. Then I saw Şevket Susam coming out to his doorway. We chatted a bit. Later I saw Muhammed Kaya in front of Azize Kaya’s house near the grocery. I went over, Şevket and Muhammed followed me. The four of us sat and talked. Then Muhammed Yağmur and Şevket said they would go home. Muhammed Kaya and I went to the fountain side, and Süleyman Kaya, the mentally disabled one, came with us. Muhammed Kaya and I were chatting while Süleyman listened. I saw Muhammed Yağmur come out of his house, getting into a car. I said, “Where are you going?” He said he was going to wash the car. I asked, “Can you drop me home?” He said no. I said, “Then drop me by the school, I’ll walk up the hill.” When I reached the school area, I saw kids carrying hay. My step-grandmother Süveyla Güran asked me to help carry her hay; I couldn’t say no, so I told Muhammed to drop me near the mosque, and then I went straight up the hill home. I sat in the same room, on the same couch.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Around what time did you return home?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Around 17:30.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Then I started using my phone again—social media, YouTube. Since I had come from working away and my slippers and shoes were torn, and I knew my brother Osman was working at Ongözlü and would come early, I called him. I said, “Bring me a pair of slippers.” He said, “Okay, brother.” Then while I was on my phone, my mother came and said, “Call your father and brother; will they make it for dinner or not?” I looked at my phone and saw it was off. Yüksel Güran is my mother. I said, “Mom, bring your phone, I’ll call them from yours.” Since my mother cannot read or write, I dialed myself and handed her the phone. Both of them said they would be late for dinner. Then, Your Honor, my mother said, “The barn window is open; the turkeys are getting out and the dog eats them.” I said, “Okay, mom.” I went up toward the barn, told her she could come with me. When I went there, I noticed Ferhat Kaya, Ufuk Kaya and Furkan Kaya on the hillside. Ferhat Kaya kept calling me insistently, “Come, come.” When I went toward them, they had a red dog. It came to me. Ferhat came near me and said, “Come on, I came to you, if you don’t come now…” I said, “I’m not coming, really; my mother will call me anyway.” He said okay. “We have guests,” I said, “Then I’ll go home.” He said okay. Ufuk Kaya came with me. Furkan Kaya didn’t. Ufuk and I went to the small hill right next to the barn and sat there. While Ufuk and I were chatting, Ufuk saw Yusuf Kaya coming from the mosque side. Ufuk stood up, waved, and called Yusuf Kaya over. Yusuf came, Your Honor, and we all sat and talked. Then I noticed my mother coming. She came and said, “Son, close the window, we’ll put the turkeys inside.” I said okay, mom. I went with her. The window was hard to close, so I picked up a stone and a bottle to push it shut. After closing it, we put the turkeys inside. And then again…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In the meantime, were you smoking with your friends?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Cigarettes, the regular ones we all know, right?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In Diyarbakır they sometimes call marijuana “cigarette.” We mean ordinary cigarettes, not marijuana, correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : After we put the turkeys inside, I went back to my friends. My mother came near us and saw cigarettes in their hands. She said, “It’s a sin, don’t smoke, it harms you,” and left. We kept sitting and chatting. Then Furkan Kaya came to me. I said, “Why didn’t you come and greet me earlier?” He said, “I had just come from work, my clothes were dirty, I smelled bad, I didn’t want to bother anyone.” I said, “No problem.” While sitting with Furkan Kaya, we were with Yusuf and Ufuk Kaya too. It was getting dark. I noticed my brother Muhammed coming home from behind the mosque. Ufuk said it was getting dark, “Let’s go home, we’ll go out again later.” I said, “Okay, uncle.” Then, Your Honor, as we were heading home, Muhammed Kaya — sorry, Güran, Your Honor, the surnames…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s all right.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : My brother Muhammed Güran caught up with me, and we went home together. I went inside again, sat in the same room, on the couch, took my mother’s phone since mine was off and charging. I saw that my brother Osman had sent photos to her phone. I called Osman and said, “Bring me the first pair of slippers you mentioned,” then hung up. He said okay, brother. Then while playing with Eren, I noticed my mother laying the table and the call to prayer being recited.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In the meantime, didn’t Narin cross your mind?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, when she said at 1 o’clock that she would go to the mosque with Hatice and Fatma, since she often played with them and sometimes stayed at their house…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t suspect anything unusual.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Then, Your Honor, my mother laid the table, the call to prayer ended, she was about to go to the kitchen when she turned and asked, “Where is Narin?” I said, “I don’t know. The last I heard was that she was going to the mosque at 1 o’clock.” Then, Your Honor, my mother took her phone and started calling Hediye Güran. Hediye said Narin wasn’t with them. We went up the hill—the one from where we can see Maşallah Güran’s house. We called out, “Is Narin there with you?” They said no. I took my brother Muhammed and went down toward the mosque. I sent Muhammed to Azize Kaya’s house. I called out softly, “Narin, Narin,” thinking maybe she was playing somewhere or distracted. When Muhammed came back and said, “Brother, she’s not there either,” I raised my voice, calling “Narin, Narin” louder. I went toward the fountain, the mosque, the school, but I couldn’t find her. When I came back toward the mosque again, I noticed my father Arif Güran had arrived, and by then the villagers were all up searching. We all started looking for Narin Güran together.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Well, during the period you described, did you ever see Salim Güran?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor. I did not see him at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You also said that while you were sleeping at home, you did not hear any sounds of anyone entering or leaving. Only a friend called you. Do you remember whether you spoke with him?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I answered the phone. He said, “You went to Diyarbakır, you forgot us,” and so on. I said, “I’m sleeping; call later.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He hung up.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : He said okay and hung up.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, Enes, this is your most recent account. Like Nevzat, you also have statements at different stages that contradict each other.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why are you making these contradictory statements?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, not because of contradiction. There were things I did not remember at the time. For example, there were things I could not say in my statement; there were things I did not remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So this contradiction is not because you planned something and hid or concealed it, but because you could not recall due to the shock of the incident.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Exactly, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I understand. Now, regarding the grocery: the grocer said the shop was not open. Our attorneys suggested he might have said that to avoid being a witness, or that he might have been at home. There is a contradiction here as well, yet you say you went to the grocery.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Even the grocer’s son, Şevket, knew the grocery was open.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I also have witnesses. Muhammed Yağmur and Muhammed Kaya know it too.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, according to the HTS base station data—let me read your HTS base station records.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : At 14:30 you are at home. Until 15:51 you clearly ping at home—so until 16:00. At 15:57 you go to Salim’s house. Why?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I definitely did not go to Salim’s house, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not. Then at 16:04—let me put it this way—at 15:57, when you go to Salim’s house, Salim comes right after you.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I definitely did not go to Salim Güran’s house that day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then at 16:04 you are at an unknown location; at 16:11 you are at your own house. And around 18:13 you are near the school, and your phone is off.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Since I was around the school—when I was around the school—it was already about 17:30, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : 18:13.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right, so 18:13 is around 5 o’clock, isn’t it, Your Honor?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : 6. Eighteen is 6—ten past 6.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Around 17:30 I was already by the fountain—sorry, by the school. From there, with Muhammed Yağmur, we turned toward the mosque and went up the hill.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you never went to Salim’s house.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now another allegation. In the indictment it is stated that you committed the killing collectively, but there is no allegation as to why. So there are various claims. The first is Nevzat’s claim of a relationship between Salim and your mother. Another allegation is that you were in an improper situation and, because Narin saw this, you killed Narin.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Absolutely not, Your Honor; nothing of the sort.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So nothing of the sort.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you have any romantic attachment with Salim’s daughters?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you see Salim’s daughters on the day of the incident?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you have any sexual relations with them?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not. Now, could it be like this? I am only speaking of possibilities. Narin came home and said, “Where is my brother Enes? Where is my brother Enes?” At that moment you were in an improper state in the barn. She came to the barn. After she saw you there, could you have taken any action against her?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor. I never even went to the barn.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You never went to the barn. You only slept.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, the witnesses—Furkan and Ufuk—say they were together at the time of the incident… Let me clarify this again, Enes. In your first statement you say, “I went out to search around 16:30,” whereas in a later statement and in your statement here in court you say, “I started searching for Narin after it got dark, at 18:30 or even 19:00.” But in your first statement you say, “I started searching for Narin from 04:30.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, in the first days—the second and third days too—people in the village were saying, “I saw Narin here at this hour. I saw her around 4 o’clock, I saw her at 6, I saw her at 3.” And when we went to the gendarmerie on the fourth day, I did not clearly remember the times.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I understand. So this is the reason for your confusion.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In your conversation with your father, you talked about dinner, correct? For a short time. A very short one—you have a 16-second call.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor. My mother spoke with him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You dialed your father from your mother’s phone, and your mother spoke on her phone.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then why did you not inform your father later? Your father learned from a third person that Narin had been abducted. Not abducted—pardon me—had gone missing.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor. Your Honor, since my own phone was at home charging, and I had nothing on me, when I was searching for my sister Narin in the lower part of the village, I did not have any family member in mind. Only, “Where is Narin?”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, Enes, think about this apart from everything. There was a very serious search for about 10 to 15 days, correct? Drones, cameras, thousands of teams, constant contact with you. However, the gendarmerie has a report like this: while we were constantly searching, starting with Salim Güran, family members continually gave us misleading suggestions, and because of them we repeatedly searched in different places and along different lines. Did you witness anything like this?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In other words, were you involved in directing the gendarmerie or the law enforcement there into other areas, into misguided searches?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, only on the night of the second day—the military team was on the school side. I went to them and said, “I am not at ease. Perhaps the villagers have not checked at all. There are places I want to be checked.” They said okay, “We will look wherever you want.” Afterwards, together with them, we also looked at places that had not been searched. In fact, at the small window that Nevzat Bahtiyar mentioned, I myself entered there together with the military. When I checked, I did not see anything. But before I went in, I noticed Nevzat Bahtiyar on the roof. When I came out, Nevzat Bahtiyar was not there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What time period are you talking about?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : The second day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You are talking about the second day. So, was Nevzat Bahtiyar following you then? Is that what you mean?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, I do not know. No, that is not what I am saying. When I went searching with our military team and the gendarmerie, I told them I was not at ease and wanted to search again. They said, “All right, Enes.” Then, when I went to Nevzat Bahtiyar’s barn—the small window he mentioned, the one facing the back, toward the hay—I went in there. Our military team did not go in. But before I went in, I saw Nevzat Bahtiyar on the roof. When I came out, I certainly did not see him there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, so is there a suspicious movement here?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, on the day of the incident, nothing about Nevzat Bahtiyar crossed our minds. Nevzat Bahtiyar certainly did not occur to us.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, that is what I am going to ask. Now, while you were saying that Salim—even his stepmother—had abducted your daughter, that Narin might have been abducted, and while your father insisted that his step-siblings were alcoholics, that he did not like them, that they did it, not a single person suspected Nevzat.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That is correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is that correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That is correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is that correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That is correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then why did Nevzat kill her? In your later statements, you claim Nevzat did it.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That is correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, considering that you had no suspicion of him and claimed there was no hostility between you, what about the later hostilities—the car dispute, the incident about bringing a girl to the house, the alleged abduction, or the military girl issue? I’m not referring to those.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor. Your Honor, those car issues were about some transactions.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I’m not referring to those, but they came up later. I mean, right after the incident, that car issue was not a serious matter for you. You did not suspect Nevzat. You’re saying now that Nevzat’s brother Askeri brought a girl home, you intervened, then there was talk of abduction—these are allegations made by the prosecution. So none of this crossed your mind, and you did not suspect Nevzat at all, correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That is correct, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, if you never suspected him, why would a man kill your sister?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Could Nevzat’s allegation be true—that he had a relationship with your mother?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, such a question should not even be asked to me. She is my mother, after all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You’re right, I respect that, and I apologize for asking. But I am trying to uncover the truth. You are being tried for intentional homicide. I’m here to find who is innocent and who is guilty. As a court, we seek to distinguish right from wrong, the innocent from the guilty. That’s why I ask—please don’t take offense. You never went to Salim’s house, correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then why do the base station records show this?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, as I said, during sleep the phone might still ping a tower—if the internet is on, or if someone calls.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But that’s not the case here. Look, you say you were sleeping at home. The data confirms that—you were stationary at home. But what did I tell you? At 15:57 it says you went to Salim’s house.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, I definitely did not go to Salim Güran’s house that day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You did not. I’ll ask again—you didn’t go, yes—but I must ask again, since everyone will likely ask the same question: Did you go to Salim’s house that day to take a bath and remove bite marks on your arm?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You say you didn’t go, but I’m asking plainly.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, I bit my arm on the third day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. A petition came from prison. Our lawyers have probably seen it—a citizen claimed to have solved the case. He wrote an interesting petition. He said: “If Enes was bitten on the arm at the time of the incident, why didn’t he bite his arm when he was taken into custody?” A regular citizen said this. Then, three days later, you bit your arm, and later, an inmate sent another petition saying: “If Enes keeps biting his arm and hurting himself, why didn’t he do that in prison?”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Because my father was worried about me, and I called him every day through video chat. I didn’t want him to see anything on my face. I didn’t go to prison as a criminal; I went there for my sister, for Narin—for justice.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But in prison, you often made suggestive remarks, Enes. You told Eren, “Abican,” you mentioned a toothbrush—as if warning him: “Be careful, don’t talk too much.” What was the reason for that?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, I didn’t talk to Eren like that. I just didn’t want Eren to know I was in prison. I would tell him, “Abican, you come every week, I give you chocolate.” So that he wouldn’t realize I was in prison, I told him not to talk to anyone and to be careful.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So that’s what you meant. All right. Then about the toothbrush—you said, “I kissed Narin; maybe DNA could come out, brother.” What did you mean by that?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t even know what DNA or anything like that is.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You learned about it through this case?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes. I just didn’t want to keep it inside. I wanted my family to know. I wanted my father and my brother to know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : As I said, in your August 29 statement, like the one you gave here, you said you met Tahir, went to the grocery, and so on. But in a later statement, you didn’t mention those; instead, you said you sat with Ufuk, Furkan, and Yusuf, and later your mother came. Two witnesses said your mother came, one didn’t mention her at all.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : It was Furkan Kaya who didn’t, Your Honor. I remembered later, while in prison—when my mother called me over, Ufuk Kaya and Yusuf Kaya were with me, but Furkan Kaya was not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He wasn’t with you.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, I’m asking these again because your first statement lacked details due to shock. I won’t repeat them further. Because between your August 25 and August 29 statements, there are serious contradictions. The reason is that, in the heat of the event, you couldn’t recall everything and gave an incomplete account. Correct? You also mentioned the slipper matter.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, Madam Judge said something interesting. When you told Osman, he said they told him Narin was missing, so he went to Çarıklı. But you say you learned Narin was missing around 8 p.m. Did you tell Osman that Narin was missing?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then why did Osman testify otherwise?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, when Akın joined me during the search—while I was calling for Narin—Akın Kaya was with me, and my brother Osman called Akın. Osman said, “It’s me, Osman, Osman is calling.” I took the phone from him and said, “Narin is missing; where are you? Come quickly.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, in the village, there was a fight among women. You witnessed it. Can you tell us how that happened?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Of course, Your Honor. Your Honor, after we were told by the military and gendarmerie that we had lost Narin, there were Melike Güran and Yasemin Güran—Yasemin is my aunt. They came all the way from Bismil. Then Melike Güran said, “I knew this would happen.” And Yasemin Güran said to her, “If you knew, why didn’t you speak up, why didn’t you tell the truth?” Then, Your Honor, Yasemin Gül—pardon, Your Honor, Yasemin Gül—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yaser Gül, Yasemin Gül, all right.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I pushed her toward my house, saying, “What are you doing? Is this the time to fight?” I pushed her toward my house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So what did those women mean when they said, “We knew this would happen”? Did you ask?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why not?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Because the fight got worse, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Even so—you could have pulled one aside and asked, “What do you mean, you knew? My sister is missing; who killed her that you’re fighting over it?” Didn’t that cross your mind?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You’re a grown man, a smart man. Our attorneys insist that you’re clever enough to be an excavator operator at a young age. You graduated from a science high school, correct? You’re a thoughtful person. Our attorneys and all the directors mention your intelligence to us. Isn’t it suspicious that such a smart person didn’t ask questions but instead acted as if silencing someone?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, when Melike Güran said that, it was Yasemin Gül who spoke to me. I didn’t hear what Melike said. Yasemin Gül said to me, “They are saying this, they are saying that. If they knew, they should have told the truth.” Then, Your Honor, when I pushed Yasemin Gül, the older women—Salihe Kaya, those from the upper side, the lower side, my aunt Gül—they all started fighting each other.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. For example, who is Maşallah Güran to you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : My sister-in-law.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Your sister-in-law said, “Everyone knows everything; don’t make me talk,” and then two people forcibly covered her mouth.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I didn’t hear that, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Who is Birsen Güran to you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : My cousin.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Maşallah’s daughter.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She said, “It’s not like we did it, yet you’re blaming us,” and then they covered her mouth too. So it’s like a group of men were trying to silence a group of women—you, Fuat, Erhan, correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor. When the women were fighting, one woman shouted, “Because of you men, we’re fighting each other.” When I ran over, a soldier came and held me tightly. My father took me from his hands, made me sit somewhere, and later they took me to the gendarmerie.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, Enes, you deny everything. You say you had no relations with anyone. You say you weren’t in the barn, you were home. And you say you didn’t kill your sister. Then why are you a defendant here?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why do you think, among all these people—why not Muhammed Kaya, why not Birsen, why not someone else—but you, the one in the house, are the one accused by the prosecution?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You never thought about it. Did you call Ufuk, Furkan, or the others to meet that day?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : To meet?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because they said you called them, said you’d take a bath, and so on.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t talk on the phone? So when you went out, were they already outside?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, when I went out, to the hill beside the barn, I saw Ferhat Kaya, Ufuk Kaya, and Yusuf Kaya there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t plan to meet them beforehand?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Am I remembering wrong?​\n\n\nDefense Attorneys : Your Honor, he’s right, but there was someone who said, “I called but couldn’t reach him.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I even said to him, “Call me then—let’s see where my phone is,” and that’s how it happened there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So I remember correctly, not wrong. All right. You also reject the HTS and base data. After this incident, you began the search operations. Then unfortunately, Narin’s body was found. Our lawyer made a correction on this, but legally we still refer to it as “the body”—please don’t misunderstand; we mean Narin’s lifeless body. That’s just legal terminology. So, after that, whom did you suspect?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : After that, Your Honor?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes. You’re a rational young man; I say this again. I can clearly see this from your video statements, from your communication with your family, from your behavior here in court. I think a smart person like you would have suspected someone or pursued some lead. But I see none of that. On the contrary, in the file I see an Enes who intervened in the women’s fight, as if trying to conceal evidence.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why didn’t you ever feel suspicious of anyone?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : At first, when Salim Güran was detained, they said blood was found in his car, that it was Narin’s blood. To tell the truth, I suspected him—even though he’s my uncle—because my sister was missing. But later they said it was just hair.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you ask Salim about this?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor. I was detained on the fourth day and released on the ninth. I never even saw Salim Güran.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So he was in prison.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And you never spoke with Nevzat either.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : With Nevzat—on the fifteenth day, he came to the mosque.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you ever talk about this matter with your mother?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : How, Your Honor?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When these allegations arose, when you were detained, weren’t you and your mother detained together?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : We were detained together.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : During that time, did you have a chance to ask her?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, there wasn’t an opportunity, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you never asked, “Mother, did you have a relationship with someone? Did you kill my sister?”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I did not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Is Salim Güran the head of this household?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Other than being the village headman, does Salim Güran have any title in your household?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No. No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is it possible that Salim Güran committed the killing?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You don’t know. Do you have any opinion as to whether Nevzat might have committed the killing?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Only about the car sale—that’s what stuck in my mind.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So would he be so vicious as to kill your sister over a car sale?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : In that gathering of elders—my father Arif Güran said to Nevzat Bahtiyar, because he stutters—“Don’t stutter, son.” Pardon me, Mr. Prosecutor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Go on, go on—you can even curse openly.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : “Don’t talk back, son; wherever you get that money, you will bring it. It is a right. A case has been filed; he must pay the money.” And then, Your Honor, as for Nevzat Bahtiyar saying, “I went up the hill; I gave the money there to Yüksel Güran and Arif Güran”—I was there too, Your Honor. Nevzat Bahtiyar came and handed the money to my father. My father handed it to my mother. And Nevzat Bahtiyar sat among us and said, “There’s no problem. If you like, you never have to come at all.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. There’s also this, Enes. In your father’s press statement and in your brother’s statements, you start by saying what you just said: “Who is Nevzat?” You say, “Who is Nevzat to come to our house?” Your brother even had a grave remark: “Who is Nevzat to even look at our chicken?” So, after you received the money from the man you call “Who is Nevzat,” you still say “Who is Nevzat.” This man is timid and meek; we have all concluded he is a stutterer. Do you really believe that such a person would be capable of killing your sister—according to the opposing side’s claim, that he would announce that everyone had left the village, pay the girl money, lure her over, and execute such a plan?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I do, Your Honor. He had already paid her before.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What’s wrong with giving money?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I mean, by giving money he got her accustomed to him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you’re saying he had been planning this for a week or two.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : How much money are we talking about? Fifty thousand lira? Would Nevzat really lose his mind over a car matter to the point of killing someone?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : In fact, because my father used that phrase to him, from there—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When did this happen?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Before I went to Malatya, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Approximately?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Approximately four months ago.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Four months. So you think he bore a grudge from that incident and made a plan. All right. But you still have no definite opinion on whether Nevzat actually did the killing.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Exactly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Narin’s friends, in statements taken with a child psychologist present, said that—as her name suggests—she was delicate, and that she would not get into strangers’ cars or meet with strangers. Would Narin consider Nevzat a stranger or not?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : If he had given her money, she wouldn’t see him as a stranger, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : If he had given her money, she wouldn’t. Before these events came to light, did you ever see Nevzat giving Narin money, were you present, or did Narin tell you anything like that?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : My mother told me. She said Nevzat was giving her money.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And did you not demand an explanation—“Who is Nevzat to give Narin money?”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor. My mother told me this before the court proceedings.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Before the court matter—before Narin went missing—did you ever see or hear that Nevzat was giving her money?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, I was in Arguvan, Malatya at that time.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did Narin not tell you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : “Brother, Nevzat is giving me money?”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I arrived on the 20th anyway.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Even if not you, she would tell Muhammed, Eren, Osman, Yüksel, Arif. I don’t mean you personally—you were out of town. Did none of them hear anything?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because here’s the thing: if Nevzat were giving money, and given your family structure, if you heard about that money, with your “Who is Nevzat?” attitude you would easily confront him—“What’s this about, brother, why are you giving her money?” Even Eren, as I understand it, could ask this.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Your Honor, it was never told to me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It was never told.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do any of our judges have questions? No. Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any questions? Please, speak close to the microphone, Mr. Prosecutor.​",

    "text": "Trial Prosecutor ​\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Enes Güran. Are you a graduate of the Science and Technology High School?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : As the Presiding Judge emphasized, when you said around 18 you thought it meant 5—what did you mean? Around 18 is 6, right?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Now, in the gendarmerie interview record of August 23, the information-taking record of August 24, and again on August 25—three records in a row—you say you started searching for Narin around 16:30, correct? I’m asking because we see you as a sensible young man.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, exactly.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : These are the points we find odd. You say you started searching at 16:30, outside?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, exactly.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Yet you do not accept this now, correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You don’t accept it. Why did you give a false statement? You say your mind was confused, is that it?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : My sister was missing and still not found, and people in the neighborhood mostly kept saying times: “I saw her here at this time; I saw her at that time.”​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So that’s why you gave the same statement for the first three days.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, exactly.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Not one day, not two—three days you said, “I was searching for my sister at 16:30,” purely due to confusion?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, exactly.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : All right. How many times did you leave the house?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Twice, Your Honor. Twice.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : The first time? At 4 o’clock. You went out at 16:00—around 15:57. Then the base data matches, right?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Base data?​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Yes.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : What do you mean?​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : The base station data we alleged—at 15:57 you went to Salim’s house.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So that matches. No? You say you went out at 16:00.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I didn’t go to his house.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : That matches—I’m talking about leaving the house. You went out once?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What did you do that first time?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I went down toward the fountain, to Tahir Kaya; I went to the grocery and asked for an energy drink.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What time did you get back?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : At 05:30.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You returned at 05:30. When did you go out again?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Around 6.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You went out at 05:30. What time did you say you called Osman?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t remember calling Osman.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Could it have been between 05:30 and 06:00?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : When I got home, I noticed my phone was off and my slippers and shoes were torn. That’s when I called my brother Osman.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : X-XXX-XXX-26-21—that’s Osman’s number, isn’t it?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Osman uses that number. Yes—the one ending in 26-21.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You have a call at 17:49—10 seconds. Another at 17:50—four minutes, 220 seconds. Correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : There was talk about slippers, right?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You told him to get size 42 slippers from Çarıklı. You couldn’t have talked about slippers for four minutes. What did you talk about for four minutes?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Well, since my brother Osman was in Ongözlü, and I have friends in Ongözlü, I also talked with my friends.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Your brother was working as a waiter in Ongözlü?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : At that time. What did you do? I don’t quite understand—what did you talk about for four minutes?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Since my friends also work at that café, I asked him to hand the phone to them—so that no one would bother or talk to my brother Osman.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You brought this up at a time when your battery was low. Your battery was low, right? That’s what you say.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What did you talk about with your father at 17:43 for 24 seconds?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t remember, Your Honor.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Just three to five minutes before the slipper call.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t remember, Your Honor.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What time did your battery die then?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Around six o’clock, Your Honor.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Around six. According to the base data, it’s said your phone turned off at 18:13. That matches exactly, doesn’t it?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : If you look at it according to that, Mr. Prosecutor.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I’m not asking about the base data. It says here your phone turned off at 18:13.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Does that match?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : It doesn’t exactly.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What time did it turn off? You said around six.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, that’s correct.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Then when your phone turned off, you just said your mother asked you to call your father to see if he was coming for dinner.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : And you said you couldn’t call because the phone died, right? Then you spoke from your mother’s phone, correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, my mother spoke with him.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Your mother spoke.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : But your last call was a four-minute one with Osman.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I didn’t call my father from my own phone anyway.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You did call your father—at 17:43.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I didn’t call my father to say something like “Will you be late for dinner” or anything like that.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You don’t remember what you talked about with your father during that minute.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : And, Your Honor, Mr. Prosecutor, my mother came to me and said, “Son, call your father and brother to see if they’ll make it for dinner.” So I checked my phone and realized it was off. Then I told my mother to bring her phone so we could call from it. Since my mother can’t read or write, I dialed and handed her the phone. She spoke with him.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : All right, your phone turned off around six, at 18:13. What were you doing then?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I put my phone on charge.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You were home.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, I was home.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Why didn’t you plug it in earlier?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I did plug it in.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What time did you turn it back on?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : When we realized that Narin was missing.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You didn’t turn your phone on until 19:11—about an hour. The phone was on charge for an hour, according to your statements. Around 19:11 is when you noticed Narin was missing—around dinner, correct? That’s what the base data indicates. Your mother brought her phone to you, and you started calling people with it, right? You said, “My mother asked us to call some people since she can’t read or write,” didn’t you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You said that. Then why didn’t you turn on your own phone to help contact people yourself?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : It didn’t occur to me.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Why was your mother the only one calling people? Why didn’t you call your father to let him know at that time?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : It didn’t occur to me; I didn’t even realize the seriousness of the situation yet.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Your sister was missing. Your phone was charged and plugged in, but you went out without taking it, is that right?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You went out to search for your sister without taking or turning on your phone.​\n\n\nDefense Attorneys : Your Honor, I apologize. There will be a misunderstanding here. At that time, there was no confirmed report of a disappearance. But Enes has this desire to answer every question, to satisfy everyone. It might turn into one of those public misinterpretations again.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I didn’t understand what you meant by “misinterpretation.”​\n\n\nDefense Attorney Mahir Akbilek : Your Honor, as my colleague mentioned, I forgot to point out that regarding these questions—excuse me—we intentionally didn’t refer to Article 206/2a. We discussed it among ourselves. For example, the basis of what’s being defended here—the concept and its legal nature are uncertain, and it’s unclear who prepared these documents. Did we all agree beforehand to treat this document as material evidence, as a conclusive basis, before using it as the backbone for questioning?​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : First of all, Your Honor, HTS and base data are separate things. My questions to Enes concern HTS only. The BTK responses show a 17:43 call. Do you acknowledge that?​\n\n\nDefense Attorney Mahir Akbilek : I’m very serious—believe me, when it’s our turn to speak according to proper CMK procedure, you’ll see that the document you think is reliable evidence is, in fact, incredibly misleading—you won’t believe it.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : But, Counselor, my question logically follows. I’m referring to HTS data, not base data—HTS.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Since I read your written defense thoroughly, I know your position regarding those base records—no, no, let me finish. When I asked Nevzat a question earlier, I made a reference—to you, correct? You said you did not accept the base data. So why did you find it inappropriate when I used that same base record, which is also in the indictment as evidence, to question with?​\n\n\nDefense Attorney Mahir Akbilek : Not at all, Your Honor, it’s a misunderstanding.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I see. All right, no problem. That’s why I made that reference…​\n\n\nIn this part of our recording, simultaneous conversation among the defense attorneys, complainant’s counsel, and the court panel caused overlapping audio, and approximately two minutes of the recording could not be transcribed.​\n\n\nDefense Attorney Mahir Akbilek : We all know there’s a background here, and the mistakes from that past are before us. Each of us—lawyers, all jurists, and the public—we all share this…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, let’s get to the conclusion. Proceed with the defense.​\n\n\nDefense Attorney Mahir Akbilek : Your Honor, at least in these direct questions drawn from the limited data set, the defendant should be given time to think. At least five or ten seconds to breathe before answering. Just because he’s a science high school graduate, does that make him Einstein?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I only wish you had shown the same sensitivity when questioning Nevzat Bahtiyar—instead of firing off questions one after another. If you had waited for him to breathe, I’d be more convinced of your sincerity. But I’m not.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : In your four-minute call with Osman, you said you also talked with your friends. You explained that’s why it took that long. Since you have that level of detail, I naturally feel entitled to ask what you discussed with your father at 17:43, based on the HTS record. The court accepted the indictment’s base data, so asking HTS-related questions is entirely legitimate.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Please, go ahead, Mr. Prosecutor.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Why did you ask for slippers?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Because my shoes were torn, Your Honor. I had come from Arguvan, Malatya.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : That’s all?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes. Because I came from out of town.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Did he bring the slippers?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : He did. But I didn’t wear them.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You didn’t wear them. All right. No further questions, Your Honor. Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We’ll begin with questions from the Diyarbakır Bar Association. As the court, we do not take sides with any of the defendants. The way I treated Nevzat is the same way I treated Enes. If anyone has a different impression, please say so. If anyone says, “Your Honor, we got such an impression,” I’ll leave my robe right here. I’m being very clear—I would leave my robe and withdraw from this case. I will show the same approach to Yüksel and to Salim. On Monday, I have another trial; I’ll act exactly the same there. I don’t look at any case based on who the defendant is. For me, this case has no special distinction from any other. If I ever made such a distinction, I would quit this profession—very clearly. If anyone here, including lawyers from the Diyarbakır Bar Association, can say the Presiding Judge shows a different level of attention in this case compared to others, I’ll step down immediately. Can anyone say that? Let someone from the Diyarbakır Bar say it. I’m saying this openly and clearly. I’ll even adjourn this hearing today if needed and withdraw from it. I show the same diligence in every case. Let me clarify that—to clear any doubts. I say the same thing to the press: for us, this case is just one of hundreds of cases we handle. It only receives more attention because it’s more significant in your eyes, and we respond with proportional care. We’ll continue on Monday as well. Monday we have a murder case with detained defendants; we’ll show the same diligence there. I show equal respect to every defendant. I’ve shown the same respect to drug dealers, to those accused of killing children, and to those accused of killing their spouses. Therefore, regarding our court’s stance—I’m explaining, not defending—I won’t engage with these allegations. Let there be no such doubt in anyone’s mind. The same respect I show you, I showed Nevzat. He’s not my father’s son, and neither are you. I’m seeing you for the first time. I’ll show the same respect to Ms. Yüksel and to Mr. Salim. I’m not even from Diyarbakır; I may be transferred this year or next. If anyone has any gossip or doubts about bias, please state it openly, so everyone knows the court stands above suspicion. Let me make that very clear. Mr. Nahit knows this, and so do you. I’ve been transparent from the beginning. Every time you spoke, I said “amenna” and acted accordingly. I’m saying all this because of the impression I’ve received.​",

    "text": "Diyarbakır Bar Association ​\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir ​\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Enes, you said that around 17:30 on the day of the incident, you returned home. When you came back, was there anyone in the house?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I didn’t see anyone.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : I mean your own house. When you returned, did you see anyone at all? Your mother?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, I didn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did you see Hediye Güran?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, I didn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You didn’t see Hediye Güran?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I didn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : How many times did Ms. Hediye go and come that day?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I only saw her once.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You only saw her once.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, when I woke up inside the house.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : After that, she didn’t come back?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : So when you returned home at 17:30, Hediye wasn’t there—you’re sure of that. All right. How did you bite your arm? Can you show us?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Should I?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Go ahead.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No need to show it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Take off your jacket. You can show it clearly. Let’s record it on camera.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I was sitting on the couch like this. I bit my arm like this and rested it on the couch. My father was sitting by the window. Because I heard the sound of him crying, I bit my arm hard and leaned it toward the couch—so that he wouldn’t get upset again, so he could sleep at night.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Where did you bite?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Here, look.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Can you show it?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Look—it’s still here, look.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : All right. When you bit, didn’t your body reflexively pull back?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : There are three visible bite marks, and according to the forensic report, at least three to six days had passed. Yet the teeth marks are clearly visible in the photos. Only whether it’s from an adult or not couldn’t be determined. When pain reaches a certain level, the body reflexively pulls away, whether you want it to or not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Counselor, that’s not really a fair question.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : It didn’t?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Sometimes in extreme situations, people don’t even realize they’ve been shot until a minute later—or even five minutes. Let’s not go into medical science. Let’s move on.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Your Honor, there are medical articles about this. We can request an expert opinion later.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let’s not debate medicine here. Leave that to the doctors.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : I only asked because it’s medical data.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : The cornfield—on the day of the incident. What time did you go there?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : It was nighttime.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Nighttime. Approximately?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I didn’t have my phone.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : All right. What were you wearing that night?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : A sweatshirt with “Columbia” written on this side.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : I can’t quite hear you.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : A sweatshirt with “Columbia” written on this side. It was all black. And these pants.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : A black sweatshirt. Did you have a jacket?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : No jacket?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Then how do you explain the marks on your back if you were wearing a sweatshirt?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : The marks on my back came from when we went into the barns on the second or third day. We entered Nevzat Bahtiyar’s barn and also the barns near Süheyla Güran’s house. Those places hadn’t been entered before. I was with Yunus Karacoşan. When we went into the barns near Süheyla Güran’s house, Yunus Karacoşan saw it too. Everything there is nailed and wooden—it’s a rundown place.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : So, the cornfield—those marks on your back, they didn’t happen there?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Not in the cornfield. All right, thank you. I have no further questions. Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Please state your name. Go ahead.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık ​\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : You had lunch on the day of the incident. Then Narin looked at the clock, correct? She noticed the time.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : What did she say then?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : “Mom, it’s late. I’m going to the mosque.” My mother said, “It’s hot, dear; don’t go today.” And Narin insisted, “Hatice and Fatma are going to the mosque, so I want to go too.” My mother said okay.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Did Narin make a gesture with her fingers and say, “There is a course until four o’clock; let me go there”?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I did not see anything like that.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : All right. You came from work that day—you work in Malatya, correct? Do you receive a salary?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I do.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : How do you receive your salary?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Monthly.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Monthly. Did you receive your salary before you came?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Why didn’t you receive your salary?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : He couldn’t pay. He was in a difficult situation. I did not insist on asking him for money.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : You came without money?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes. He said, “When you go to Diyarbakır, in three or four days—before the wedding—I’ll send it to you.” I said okay.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : You came from Malatya to Diyarbakır with no money on you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : My father had transferred me money.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : All right. Then why did your father give you 200 lira again in the morning—and you emphasized this here?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : He gives me cash on hand. My father transferred money to my account. He knows I don’t have cash on me. I am his son and I work for him for months. So, 200 TL in the morning, too.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : You said you met with Muhammed Yağmur when you left the house. How long did your conversation with Muhammed Yağmur last?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Do you mean only with him, or with Şevket as well?​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : With Muhammed Yağmur.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : About half an hour.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : In your previous statements, you said one and a half hours. Why are you changing your statement now?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t quite remember the times.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : There is a significant difference between half an hour and one and a half hours. It makes a serious difference whether you sit with someone for half an hour or for one and a half hours. How accurate is it to explain this by saying you don’t remember?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Very accurate.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let’s avoid argumentative questions. We’ll skip this one, yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : When did you ask your brother Osman for slippers?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Me? All right. I came home around the evening—around half past five. That’s when I asked my brother for slippers.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : After asking Osman for slippers, did you go out again?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Then why did you ask him to send them to your mother’s phone even though you were going out again?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Because my battery was low. My battery indicator doesn’t show the exact percentage. When it’s 20% or 15%, it turns red, and it’s unclear when it will shut down. That’s what I want to tell you.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Yes. All right, that’s natural of course. Since your phone battery would die, you could ask him to send it to your mother’s phone. There’s no dispute there.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : But you were not at home—you were going to leave the house. Why did you ask him to send it to your mother’s phone? You wouldn’t see it if it arrived. Why ask for it on your mother’s phone?​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Are you asking why my brother Osman sent the photos to my mother’s phone? Yes. Why did you ask for them there and not to your own phone? I asked for them that way.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : I have one more question.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : In your prison conversations with Eren, as the panel asked as well, you give him suggestions like “Don’t tell anyone. Stay quiet.”​\n\n\nDefense Attorneys : We object.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There’s nothing to object to. Objection overruled. Go ahead, Counsel. Ask your question.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Do you really think you could hide this from Eren? Because I’ll tell you why you could not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Explain whether he could hide that he went to prison.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Everyone—the entire 85 million—knows you were in prison, the whole Güran family knows. Do you think you could hide this information from Eren?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : We are not hiding information from Eren.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Then why—just now you said in your statement—right. When explaining the reason for that prison conversation with Eren, you said you didn’t want Eren to know.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s what I’m saying. He is still my little brother. He doesn’t even know his sister was killed. We told him she went on vacation. I didn’t want him to know I went to prison either.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : So, you think there is a possibility Eren wouldn’t know. Eren might not learn this.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : That’s what you think. All right. That’s all my questions. Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım ​\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : I will ask only two points—about two conversations you had in prison. When did you learn how Narin was killed?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : When my lawyers came.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : So, while you were in prison. You didn’t know before. On September 20, 2024, you had a conversation with someone called Uncle İbo.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, that’s correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : And you repeatedly asked whether the report had been issued. Then he said, “Some of the report has come out—her mouth and nose were covered.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Do you remember what you replied?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I said if there is something in the report—if anything has come out—tell the lawyers to inform me. That’s how I recall it.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : No—let me tell you what you replied: “When will I get out of here?” You didn’t express any surprise about the manner of Narin’s death. You didn’t say, “How could that be?”—that her mouth and nose were covered…​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Because I wasn’t very close with my uncle İbrahim Güran, and I was always crying with my brother Baran…​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : I’m saying you did not react with surprise to the manner of Narin’s death. You directly asked when you would be released. You didn’t show any curiosity—“Was she killed this way?”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I was in prison; I’m an 18-year-old child. That’s why I said it. Because when the report came out…​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : You say you loved Narin very much. Yet you did not find the manner of death odd at all.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Did you ever see me repeatedly hitting my face in prison? Did you see me banging my head against the walls in the bathroom?​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : At the moment you first heard it, you reacted quite normally.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let me reframe the question. Did you take it normally—or were you in shock?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I was in shock, Your Honor.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : There you also asked your father a question about bite marks not appearing after the third day.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : My father?​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Exactly.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : What did I ask?​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : “After the third day, bite marks won’t appear.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : “Bite marks won’t appear?” I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : And the response to you was something like, “Tell the lawyer, don’t tell me.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Then why is it so important to you whether the bite mark appears or not?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Because I know I bit myself. I bit myself on the third day. It has nothing to do with Narin, my mother, or anyone else.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Then why do you insist on asking that? That’s what I’m asking—whether the bite mark appears or not…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He said he doesn’t remember, Counsel. He said he doesn’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : That’s all my questions.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren ​\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I will ask you questions as counsel for the Diyarbakır Bar.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Of course, go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Narin—your sister—who was lost at age eight, first made to go missing, and then we learned she was killed. I’ll ask you about Narin.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right, go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : For instance, do you know how many times you have given statements in this case?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How many times do you think it might have been?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let me tell you—you gave statements six times.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Six statements—and as the Presiding Judge said, your narratives about the day’s timeline contradict each other across all of them. I’ll now ask questions by laying out those contradictions.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right, go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In that sense, do you remember when you were first contacted? The first contact—by law enforcement.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Law enforcement?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Law enforcement, yes. When did they first contact you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Was it the third day? Or the fourth day? Up on the hill—by Maşallah Güran’s hillside—blood was found among the stones near the house. My first statement was taken there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What did they ask you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Where I went, what I was doing where, where I was. They asked these. Why I came from Malatya.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did they ask you, “When did Narin go missing?”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : They did.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What did you say?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I said I last saw her at 1 o’clock.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did they ask you, “When did you learn that Narin was missing?”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : They did.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What time did you say?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Back then I said 04:30.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said 04:30.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So first it was 04:30 that Narin went missing. In other words, regarding the day Narin went missing—when a person’s mind and memory are sound—the first contact is at 16:00.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Look—​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, I’m asking something. Let me ask my question, then you answer, Enes.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right, go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What was the first time you gave in that first contact—say it again?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : 04:30.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : 04:30.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Look, I’m saying this—​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m not asking anything else; you don’t need to elaborate. I want an answer to my question only. Did you say you saw her at 4:30?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Along with seeing her at 04:30, did you say what else you did?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : If you believed at 04:30 that your sister had gone missing, wouldn’t a person take action?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I’m telling you I don’t remember. I don’t remember what I spoke about.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m asking you so that you recall. You learned at 16:30 that your sister was missing.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you start searching?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I said I did.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said you did.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But you hadn’t?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I realized at the evening call to prayer that my sister was missing. Around 4 o’clock.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The Presiding Judge asked earlier—yes.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The Prosecutor asked as well.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : “I saw Furkan at 17:30, at 16:00…” How many days have passed? Two months. Almost two months and ten days, right? You remember all of those hour by hour.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Because these were things I experienced—true things.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : These first contacts with law enforcement—are those things you didn’t experience, then? From the officers?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : If I speak now, it won’t work.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Speak—that’s why we’re here. We’re here to find Narin’s killer, aren’t we? It was 16:00.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : May I speak with my lawyer?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You may. Allow him one minute to speak with his lawyer.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, what are you saying? Say it again. I couldn’t enter it in the minutes; we didn’t record it on SEGBİS.​\n\n\nAv. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You can enter it in the minutes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, go ahead.​\n\n\nAv. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Your Honor, I am truly proud to be a member of the Diyarbakır Bar Association. Our mission has long been to fight against torture and ill-treatment, and we are proud of that. However, when we first took this case file and first met with the defendants—who were then suspects—they told us they had been subjected to inhuman treatment, that is, ill-treatment by law enforcement. As a former administrator of the Diyarbakır Bar on this matter, we were truly surprised by these allegations. The Bar President at the time had stated they were striving to shed light on the Narin case. We acted with that confidence, and when the hearing began, we stated that even though we are defense counsel, our aim is to serve a conclusion in accordance with justice and equity. With that service mindset…​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Are we debating the institutional identity of the Diyarbakır Bar? Its superior performance?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I don’t understand—we’ll need to wrap this up. I didn’t understand what you meant. Please. Now, let our colleague not speak—give me a moment to understand his point. You speak of respect, and I still don’t grasp his point—how is that respectful? Goodness. Wrap it up.​\n\n\nAv. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Sir, we all know legally that there isn’t even a right to intervene in this case. But what did we say? Our goal was to uncover the material truth, correct?​\n\n\nAt this point, due to simultaneous conversation among the defense attorneys, complainant’s counsel, observers, and the court panel, the audio overlapped and could not be transcribed.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That is his own statement. As I said, if you have information on this, filing a criminal complaint with the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office is your most natural right. You can submit the relevant information and documents. Then cases can be opened against those responsible for failure to report a crime or for shielding offenders. Mr. Nahit, continue with your questions.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : May I ask something as well?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : As I said, Enes—you may even repeat the insults the other side used. There is no problem whatsoever. If you wish to speak now…​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Your Honor. A moment ago, you judges expressed your perspective and approach to this case. Please allow me to respond as well. My colleague reminded us that he served for many years on the bar’s executive board. Let me also remind you—we served together. He knows well how we fought against torture. The family came to me twice before spring; I believe I even heard someone from the family shouting at me from the gallery just now. The family came to me, and in all my meetings I met together with my fellow board members—who are all in the courtroom. When they first came, they told me this: while in custody, our relatives were subjected to ill-treatment and torture. I told them: since all the lawyers assigned from the Diyarbakır Bar Association under the CMK are CMK-appointed counsel, if there is any allegation of ill-treatment or torture, please make sure these are recorded in the minutes during the statement. I have three lawyer colleagues, and when the family members who came to the bar raised this allegation, I asked them: could you tell us to whom, and in what manner, it was done? Perhaps they are listening in the courtroom now. Some said a tooth was pulled; some said a nail was pulled; some said punches were thrown to the face, iron rods used on the head; some said they were taken before their mother with high-pressure water—many things were described. I said: please file an application with us regarding these matters; they were in the process of retaining counsel. I said: file an application with us about this. In fact, one of the family members called someone after the remand on the 12^th and subsequent releases. “Come to the bar and explain what they did to you—file an application,” he said. “I can’t come and file an application,” he replied. And why did he say he wouldn’t apply? In short, they said they wouldn’t file any application on this matter. There has not been a single application to the Diyarbakır Bar Association concerning allegations of torture. This was the conversation. Afterwards, not only did the family refrain from making any application to us on this matter—regardless of this file or any file—if a suspect, perpetrator, defendant, whatever you call them, has been subjected to torture, we stand against that as well. We would continue the legal struggle for that too. But in the courtroom, let us avoid language and discourse that would put the institutional identity of the Diyarbakır Bar Association up for debate and place us as the target regarding our participation in this case. I am here so that those responsible for the violation of the right to life of eight-year-old Narin receive the punishment they deserve.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Enough. Can we move on to the conclusion now? All right, Mr. Eren will ask his question directly. Mr. Presiding Judge.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Mr. Presiding Judge. Let’s return to the question about the contradictions. Not as a suspect’s statement—I mentioned an interview record. All right. I’m referring to the interview conducted in front of your house at 8 o’clock. All right, again. What’s the date? The 23rd. Two days after the day Narin went missing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, Counsel, let’s return to the question. Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I asked the question.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ask it again so we can recall. The topic derailed.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I asked whether, after saying she was lost at 04:30—after saying she went missing at 4:30—you went to search or not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ah, all right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : And he said, “I will address these with my lawyers.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Now ask the question again. Military friends, could you sit down? Sit. Let’s take the question again. Go ahead, Enes. I’m listening.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Your Honor, my first statement was taken in Tavşantepe—at the place where blood was found. Your Honor, three people surrounded me. They asked me: what did you do? Where did you go? Your Honor, I don’t remember anything after four o’clock. I had gone toward the fountain, to the grocery, then up the hill to sit. I don’t remember those events as it is. I told them that as well. That’s what I mean.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Go ahead, Counsel.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In that interview, you were also asked about the bruise on your eye.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you remember what you answered?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I used to say it must have happened in the cornfield.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Shall I tell you what you said?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Please do.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You stated that due to the mental depression you fell into over Narin Güran’s disappearance, you inflicted self-harm.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s what I want to explain. On the first night, in the cornfield. Do you still have a question, or shall I answer?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Answer.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : On the first night, while searching for my sister in the cornfield, Berzan Güran received a call—“They say Narin has been found at the hospital”—and we set out. My uncle is Barış Güran. I got into his car and went to the hospital. When they determined it wasn’t her at the hospital, my father’s crying, my brother’s crying, and Barış Güran arguing with my brother—I couldn’t stand it. I returned to the village. Then my mother’s crying, my father’s crying—those sounds still in my ears—and because my brother was upset, I withdrew to a corner and struck my face repeatedly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Pardon, Your Honor. Something might have been recorded incorrectly; let me confirm. Our colleague just asked about the interview, correct? The 16:30 matter does not appear in the interview.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It’s not very important. It’s an interview, an investigative note. The point, Counsel, is the same thing I asked as well. Enes has an investigative note, and there are oral interviews, and in the staged statements there are contradictions about going out to search around 16:30. I asked the same question; Mr. Nahit is asking the same. It’s not a big deal. It’s a note, an investigative note, an interview.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m losing focus while asking questions—my concentration.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes. I’m aware.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : It’s not an appropriate method for the defendant either.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, I know it isn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : It’s not a sound method, procedurally. I mean, finally—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You must be hungry. We’ve taken the statements; perhaps it’s time for everyone—grandmothers, caregivers—to have some liver to eat. Please, ask quickly so folks can eat and settle their nerves.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I couldn’t ask—we’ve been interrupted four times.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : On the 24th, you gave another statement. An informational statement. There, you say 16:30 to the gendarmerie—this time as information.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Not an interview, but informational. The gendarmerie makes an observation about you—and you may decline to answer. The main point we object to is this: on the 23rd, when the interview was conducted with you, there’s a characterization—they describe your uneasiness.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment. May I take that phone? May I take that phone? Officers, seize that phone immediately. Immediately! Is there a phone recording there? Am I seeing wrong? Counsel with the glasses on your head—you. I saw a phone in front of you. Is that a reflection in your glasses? Is there a phone there?​\n\n\nVoice from the crowd : It’s the glasses, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Glasses. I saw a reflection.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Shall I answer your question?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We interrupted again.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In your statement on the 24th, you say she went missing at 16:30.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Then on the 25th another statement is taken from you.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : On 25.08 at 11:30.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : There again you are asked about the bite on your arm. Again you say you punched yourself.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : About the bite on my arm—about your eye.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You say, “I punched myself.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes. Perhaps while searching the cornfield, a corn stalk also touched it. I don’t remember. Because when we went to the gendarmerie about the corn—I mean when I later looked at myself, I had slight scratches on my face and slight discoloration. That’s when I remembered that after the cornfield and after going to the hospital, after the crying, I went home and injured myself—I told them that there as well.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, Enes. I asked again, and I’ll ask the same thing once more. Mr. Presiding Judge, forgive me for interjecting. Did you have relations with any of Salim’s daughters, and when you were caught for that, did Salim beat you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s the allegation. There’s no such thing?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Go ahead, Counsel.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : One question. On the 25th, you said it might be due to the corn, correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : They brought you in, and you gave a statement at the prosecutor’s office.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : At the prosecutor’s office, they asked you a question—just like I’m asking. Why, in your first statements, did you say it wasn’t due to corn but because you punched yourself in the face?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you remember what you answered?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Shall I read it to you? Maybe you’ll remember—because it’s important.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right, please read.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said: “After I went to the forensic medicine institute, when they said there were scratches, I shifted to the corn explanation.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I did not say I “shifted to corn.”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : “This was due to corn. Because I thought the scratches could be due to corn, from now on I say corn.” Yet in earlier statements you had already said it could be due to corn.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I say corn, and then I also say I injured myself.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Counsel, is that commentary? Read it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : It’s a statement. I’ll read and then ask. I already asked based on the statement. It says so there. I have it memorized. I’m asking.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Read precisely one passage—before there’s an objection for commentary.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : On 08/23/2024—question: In the interview record, after the statement from law enforcement was read to you that the bruise on your eye was due to self-harm stemming from the depression you were in, you said: “At that time I was not fully aware. But when I was taken to the forensic medicine institute and they said there were small scratches, it occurred to me that it could have been in the cornfield, and then I framed my statement that way.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : When I went to the Istanbul forensic medicine, the female doctor there examined me and asked where the slight cuts on my eye came from. I said it could also be from the cornfield, because after the cornfield I hit myself. She said okay. As for the marks on my waist—​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No—look, I’m trying to establish this point.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Please.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You give that answer to the forensic medicine, but even before going there you said it was due to corn. That’s the contradiction I’m asking you about.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Didn’t I tell you from the start that it was the cornfield?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right, you did.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But the prosecutors ask you: why do you now say “punch” instead of “corn”? And you say: after I went to Istanbul and came back, I realized it was corn. Yet in earlier statements you also mentioned corn.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : When was this statement taken? May I ask you that, Counsel? When my sister’s body was found—even after—​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : 09/12/2024​\n\n\nEnes Güran : The 12^th, right?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : And then you say we went to court and then to prison, correct?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You hadn’t gone yet—the prosecutor’s office.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : When we stood before the prosecutors, we were not ourselves. We were not.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right, you can explain that. You can also file a criminal complaint. State it plainly. Are you saying these statements were taken under torture, ill-treatment, coercion—that none of them are true?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right, you may say that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, let me ask this way. The statement you gave on 12.09, taken by the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office—was it taken under torture?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : It was taken after I was subjected to torture.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yet even there he doesn’t confess to the crime. There is no statement like “Enes confessed,” even if we accept torture. Aside from the time discrepancy we mentioned, there’s no contradiction with the other statements. In any case, you do not accept those statements, correct? You do not accept the statements taken by the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office because they were given under torture. All right, I’ve entered that into the record.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m asking these questions truly to resolve contradictions, Enes. If you recall, you were taken into custody and brought to Istanbul.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Your arm was examined at the forensic medicine institute. You returned and were released.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : After being released, when you went to the village—​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Where did you go first?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : First?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I went home. No—Hüseyin Güran.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When you went to your uncle Hüseyin Güran’s house, who was there?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Hüseyin Güran was sitting there. He is my uncle. I hugged him first because he was ill and had seen me in the gendarmerie with handcuffs, and afterwards they told me he had been very distressed seeing me like that. He said we should go to them first. When we went there, I saw Hüseyin Güran. I think Muzaffer Güran was there. And, I think, Osman Güran.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you remember what you discussed?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : My uncle only asked, “What happened? What did they say?” I told him what happened. Then I went upstairs, washed my hands and face, sat there for a while, and then went home.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Now, regarding your claim that the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office took your statement—may I ask you something based on that statement?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you meet with Birsen and Melike?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : After your release on the 29th—​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you meet with them?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I did go to their house—I told you I went to wash my hands and face, right? Yes, I said I went to wash up. I sat, as I said. Berzan Güran was there. Muhammed Kaya was there. Abdurrahman Güran was there, and Birsen Kaya—Birsen Güran, pardon. She was sitting on a chair and crying.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you have a conversation with Birsen or Melike?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right, they ask you a question.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : They read to you the statements of Maşallah, Birsen, and Melike Güran.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : To me?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes, at the prosecutor’s office. Why do they read you the statements of Birsen, Melike, and Maşallah? You know very well that’s the subject. They—Maşallah—pardon, from the very first day they have consistently stated that they saw Narin at 17:40.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So everyone in this courtroom now knows that Narin was killed—murdered—between 13:11 and 13:40.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But they had said she came to their door at 15:40, knocked, and left. Regarding this—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Anyway, not very important. Let’s not intervene.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : 17:40—pardon, 17:40. 17:40. All right. 17:40. 17:40. We now know she was killed between 11 and 15:40.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yet Birsen and Melike claimed they saw her at 17:40.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In fact, Maşallah also said that since Birsen opened the door, he told me the person at the door was Narin.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you never discuss this with Birsen? I’ll read something. Your Honor, I’ll read again.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course—better if you read it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : “We have no issue or hostility with these individuals or with my uncle Hüseyin. I don’t know why they made such statements.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : “In fact, when I first returned to the village after being taken into custody, I asked Birsen—telling her to think carefully. For a year. I asked her to think carefully.” I just said something earlier. We all now know she died between 15:11 and 15:40.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : According to the evidence in the file.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : “I asked. She said she was sure Narin had come. In my own mind I thought it would not have been possible for Narin to go to them at that hour…” You continue. What do you mean by the sentence “it would not have been possible for Narin to go to them at that hour”?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t remember. I don’t remember even when I gave that statement.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : On the 29th you were released. You go home.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You have this conversation. Until Narin’s body was found at Eğertutmaz creek on the 8th–9th, none of us knew Narin was killed between 15:11 and 15:40.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yet you make such a statement, and based on that I arrive at this conclusion and ask the question.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You thought it would not have been possible for Narin to go to them at that hour. Why did you think that?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : They say the cameras show her going up toward the hill, and then from the hill—a person—Your Honor, at the houses above ours, someone told us there was a man I didn’t recognize looking at me sharply and driving fast in his car. We suspected that man, and because of that, we didn’t know whether Narin had gone there or not.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So as of that day you didn’t ask based on information that she was killed between 15:11 and 15:30–15:40.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes. I did not ask.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right. There was mention earlier of the narrow cell analysis. If you wish, with the court’s permission, I’ll explain—base station data are ultimately evidence in the file. My colleagues objected, and of course the court will evaluate them. But the court has not yet ruled on their admissibility or exclusion. In that regard, I will ask you questions based on that evidence.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The Prosecutor also asked you.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : At 15:57, it shows you left the house.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : 15:57.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : It shows you went to Salim’s house.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I definitely did not go there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You didn’t go to Salim’s house that day at all.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I did not go at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you have any phone call with Salim that day?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You didn’t meet face to face? During the search?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : While searching at night?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No. While searching for Narin?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right, you just said something earlier—you said you went out twice.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The base station tells us you did not leave the house. Even if you had left your phone at home and gone out, it would still accept that you left the house. Because here the phone is our footprints.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That’s what we mean by base. Now, when you first went up the hill, you tell a story—you describe a sequence of events. You say you went, that you had contact with people, then you returned.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : On your second time out—yes—you say you met with Furkan and Umut and also with Yusuf. Ufuk, Furkan—yes—Yusuf.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Your mother mentions someone named İsa. Was she mistaken? Do you think she misspoke?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : İsa wasn’t there at that time.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : İsa wasn’t there. All right, let me ask: did Furkan call you at all that day?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Furkan came up the hill—to us. He said, “I’ve been calling you; why aren’t you answering my calls?” I said, “Try calling again. My phone is at home and on charge.” I told that to Furkan.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right. Did you have a chance to read Furkan’s statement?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’ll tell you something from Furkan’s statement and then ask.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right, go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Furkan says, “I came home at 18:00.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That means you were not yet on the hill at 18:00.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you remember the time?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You don’t. He says, “I came home at 18:00. When I first arrived, I saw Ufuk sitting alone on the hill.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Ufuk.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : “I went inside, took a shower, came out. This time Ufuk and Enes were sitting together. They were sitting together.” Is that true or not?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That is not true.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : One more thing.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Ufuk—you haven’t read his statement either?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, I haven’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Ufuk says—do you know who Ufuk’s grandfather is?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : His grandfather? Yes, I know—how would I not?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Who?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t recall the exact name.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right. He says, “While I was at my grandfather’s house, Furkan came from work.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : “When Furkan arrived, it was between 17:00 and 17:30, and when he arrived, he called Enes. When he called Enes on the phone, I went to drink water. He told me, ‘I called Enes—he just woke up from sleep and is heading up the hill. You go; I’ll come too.’”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No—absolutely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m asking whether such a call took place.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : There was no call. In any case, Ufuk’s and Furkan’s statements contradict each other. After I went there—​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When your mother came—she came and told you not to smoke—​\n\n\nEnes Güran : She came down and called me to close the window.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Was Furkan with you at that moment?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did Furkan come later?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : He came later.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Furkan later came over to you. When Your Honor asked earlier and you explained your sequence of events, you said, “I went back up again,” after putting the turkeys away. Did you go back up to your friends again? You went back to your friends once more.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : When I put the turkeys away and closed the window?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, I went.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : They also say—Furkan says—that his mother never came to us.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Because when my mother came at that time, Furkan wasn’t with us.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He wasn’t with you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you think Furkan actually described the incident correctly?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Correct. Furkan didn’t see my mother at all then.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Furkan never saw your mother.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : A moment ago, my colleague asked—he said, “Show us your arm.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You showed it.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said maybe it was overlooked at the time. “I bit it.” Then did you say you placed it on something? Did I misunderstand?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I said I was sitting on the couch. I opened my arm like this. By biting it like this, I bit down hard and let it drop toward the couch—just so my sobbing wouldn’t reach my father.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Who else was in the room besides you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No one.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You were alone?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I was alone.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right. The Prosecutor also asked; I’ll ask as well.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Please, go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : This is the sort of question one wants to ask in the ordinary course of life. It’s the same question I asked Nevzat while he was here.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Just as I asked Nevzat whether, if this were a normal disappearance, the father—or rather Salim—should or shouldn’t have called him, I’ll ask you something similar. You have the right not to answer. I’ll ask this: if a person’s sibling goes missing, the thing one needs most for communication is the phone, isn’t it?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : For example, can you give an explanation that would satisfy everyone here as to why you didn’t take your phone with you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Of course I can explain. Because, Your Honor, when my mother took the phone and called Hediye and others, when we went up the hill with my mother and my brother Muhammed toward Maşallah Güran’s house, Maşallah Güran said he hadn’t come to our home—said “no”—and I panicked. I immediately took Muhammed and went down toward the mosque. I went down the same road as at four o’clock. Down the same way. And I sent Muhammed to Azize Kaya’s house. I was calling for Narin softly near the mosque. I wasn’t thinking about the phone or my family or my father—only, “Where is Narin?”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So at that moment, while calling out, you didn’t feel any need for a phone.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No. In fact, when I went into the cornfield, I used Yunus Karacoşan’s phone to turn on the light.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right. You said that when you got home and woke up, you saw Hediye.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said you and Hediye asked about each other.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you know when Hediye left your house?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know. How would I know?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In other words, you didn’t see her—no?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : When I saw my aunt-in-law Hediye, I left and went downstairs. I didn’t see her again.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Hediye says she stayed in your house for about two hours. She said, “When I went out, it looked like Enes was coming in from outside.” Is that a lie?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I definitely didn’t see Hediye Güran in that way.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You didn’t see Hediye at home?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No. I only saw her around four o’clock when I woke up and asked about her. I didn’t see her otherwise.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : After you went out and came back, you didn’t see Hediye at home again?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No. I didn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Hediye says this: “While I was at the house, Enes was there. Later, I saw Enes at the door from outside. I don’t know when he went out and came back.” The counsel is asking about that. Since you said you didn’t remember, we didn’t go into the details of Hediye’s statements. We’ll ask again when Hediye testifies.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You didn’t see Hediye again.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When you first went out with Muhammed, you went to the fountain and came back, right?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Then you’re talking about your brother Muhammed Emre, correct?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, I’m talking about Emre.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Have you read Muhammed Emre’s statement?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you think Muhammed Emre is at an age where he can express himself properly?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Well, as long as the child knows his sibling is missing, I don’t think he’s at that level yet.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When Hediye came to visit you, do you remember what Muhammed was doing?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know exactly when Hediye came. You mean when I woke up, right? I just saw that Muhammed was lying down.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Muhammed was lying down. Since you were awake, he later came to you.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When Muhammed came to you, did he say who was in the house at that time?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When Muhammed woke up, would he have been in a position to see Hediye in the house?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Well, when I was lying down…​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Were you all in the same room?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : We were all in the same room. If he had woken up at that hour and seen Hediye Güran, he would have said so.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In all his statements, Muhammed says, “I didn’t see Hediye that day.”​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Well, I only woke up around four o’clock. Let me describe the sofa for you, brother. My mother was on this side, Hediye Güran was lying on that side. They were sitting. I was lying on the side near the window, where the air conditioner blows. When I woke up, I said, “Welcome, Aunt Hediye.” She said, “Thank you,” and after that, I went downstairs through the door.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, go ahead.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I’ll make one statement to support my Presiding Judge. You say you didn’t see Hediye. Hediye says about you, “When Enes was coming in from outside, I was going out the door.” She says this happened around 17:00–17:30. She even says Enes’s mother called out, “Enes, why did you come back early?” And Enes, you replied, “There was no one outside.” Hediye even describes this dialogue. So, Hediye is saying that you came back home at that time.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : There’s no such thing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Since you said you didn’t remember, we didn’t go into the details of Hediye’s statement. We’ll ask about it again when Hediye testifies.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let’s wrap it up now. I’m asking you, please.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’ll finish after this question. You said you gave a statement to the prosecution under torture and ill-treatment. Were the assessments you made about Salim also given under that pressure and torture, or were the descriptions you made about Salim true?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : They are not true.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No—Salim—actually, I mean Nevzat, pardon me. You made a description about Nevzat, didn’t you?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That description—the one you made about Nevzat—was it given under that torture?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No torture was inflicted on me about Nevzat.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Only by Salim Güran, you say, you were tortured. No, all right.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, he says what he said about Nevzat is true.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The things you said about Nevzat were not statements made under pressure or torture.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let’s have you describe Nevzat for us.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : “He’s a filthy man. Huh. I’ll speak frankly. He’s a filthy man—the filthiest man in the village. He comes and goes, but no one ever asks anything of him. Whether he went to work, what he did—no one knows. There’s a car under him, one under his son, one under him again. In fact, one of my lawyers—probably here—said that. He was his lawyer, I think. He even said, ‘Nevzat started staying in Çarıklı at night. At that time, while we were in custody, my uncle Barış Güran came himself,’ he said. ‘I personally took the gendarmerie officers to their house, and when Nevzat tried to escape through the window, they caught him there,’ he said.”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So, how would you describe the relationship between Nevzat and Salim?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : As far as I know, Nevzat and Salim—Salim Güran—are friends. I used to see them together quite often. They were always side by side.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : We’re reasoning here about what “friends” means between two people, so I’m asking these questions to clarify the statement.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : All right, go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : About someone who’s a friend—you said this sentence: “He’s such a cowardly person that he wouldn’t question what Salim says.” A man so cowardly he wouldn’t question Salim’s words.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Is that a friendship? In that friendship, would he be someone cowardly enough to carry a body—I mean, pardon me—Narin’s body? Or, if their relationship is one of submission, is he someone who would carry it without question? Because when they read that statement to you, they asked you about it, and that’s why I’m asking this question now.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You said this person—this person—is a coward.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : And you know the relationship between this cowardly man and Salim.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : They have ties, a friendship.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : They spend time together. There are even statements saying they went to restaurants together. In your statement, you said that Nevzat is such a cowardly man that he would not question what Salim says.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : May I explain why?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Go ahead.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Because Nevzat is the poorest man in the village, has nothing, and has no friends. Salim Güran, on the other hand, is the village headman and can do whatever he wants. For example, he can go to the prosecutor’s office. If there’s an objection to something, Nevzat might call him and say, “Can you handle this issue for me?” So, I said that to mean he didn’t want to spoil his good relationship with Salim.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let me ask you very plainly.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The counsel asked politely, but I’ll ask directly, as a friend would. If Salim killed—pardon me—if Salim killed and told Nevzat, “Hide the body,” would Nevzat do it?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : He would not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s it. That’s the blunt version of the question, correct? All right. You just phrased it more elegantly; I asked it more directly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because these are statements made under pressure.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I understand, but I asked in a straightforward way he could clearly grasp. When you asked it in more polished words, it got complicated. Go ahead, please continue.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’ll ask you one last question.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Our colleagues asked you as well. We have all your prison conversations in the file—all of them, including the video calls and recordings.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s correct. They were even leaked on social media—the recordings of my conversations with my family.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes, that’s what I’m referring to. You spoke with your family, your father, your brother—all of them.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Something caught my attention. Please answer as Narin’s brother.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Please. In all your conversations, especially with your brother Baran—​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You constantly show interest in the case file.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You constantly ask about the reports.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You ask about the carpets being sent to Van. You ask about your toothbrush.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You say, “I kissed Narin—something that wasn’t in any of your statements—before going to the mosque. Brother, could that cause any trouble?” Your brother even asks, “Did you tell the lawyers that?” and you reply, “No, I didn’t.” Now, I want to ask you this: whenever you bring up such topics, you keep asking about the report.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When we, as criminal lawyers, see someone so curious about a report, we tend to think they’re worried about the possibility of incriminating evidence emerging. I’m asking you openly—were you afraid of anything coming out in those reports?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Absolutely not. Definitely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When you asked about the toothbrush, what were you thinking? For example, you said Narin brushed her teeth with your toothbrush that morning.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When you said, “Brother, could that cause any trouble?” what exactly did you mean?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That morning, before Narin used my toothbrush, I had already used it. Later, when she used my toothbrush, I was already in prison. For the first time in my life, I was in a prison cell.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That’s what I’m asking.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, that’s it. It was my first time in prison in my life. I had never even seen a police station before. And in there—between those four walls—some guards behave harshly, say bad things, and it’s hard to bear. When a person has no father or family behind them, they can’t speak up. As for why I was so curious about the reports—it’s because I thought, “When my sister’s report comes out, the killers will be revealed, and it will prove we are innocent.” As for the carpets, we were treated so badly at the provincial gendarmerie—insults, curses—and when my mother was tortured and later watched the video of it being played aloud in front of me, it broke me psychologically. That’s why I became suspicious when they questioned me. I’m telling the truth.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What kind of suspicion?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : They said things like, “Nevzat did this,” “He did that with Salim,” “He was involved.” So many accusations. But if the gendarmerie had treated us properly, humanely, we would have told them everything from the beginning. Because from the very first day, I’ve been telling the truth to the soldiers and everyone. From the beginning, I’ve wanted my sister to be found.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What was your concern, technically speaking, about the toothbrush?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I didn’t know what the report would say—whether it would show traces or not. She had used my toothbrush after all, even though I was innocent.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, you’re saying it was a question asked out of fear and panic, in short.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes. For example, right now I’m staying in solitary confinement, but my family doesn’t know that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Does the Diyarbakır Bar Association have any further questions? No. Representative of Mr. Arif Güran, do you have any questions? No. Ministry of Family and Social Services, any questions without repetition? Counsel, we’ll address contradictions later. For now, we’ll take only questions. Please, state your name.​",

    "text": "Ministry of Family and Social Services ​\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun ​\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : On the day of the incident, your mother, Yüksel Güran, turned off her phone at 14:28 and turned it back on at 15:38. You turned yours off at 14:30 and back on at 15:41. So, both phones were turned off around the same time and turned back on an hour later. What happened during that hour? Why did you turn it off?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I was lying down until around four o’clock. My phone was there.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Until four. But you turned your phone on at 15:41. At 15:41. You turned it on.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : At 15:41, I must have received a call—most likely from Şahin. He probably called me at that time.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : The main call records show that at that time, there were four people in the house. Narin arrived.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : That’s not true. There was no such thing. Either Salim Güran or Nevzat Bahtiyar—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, he already said he didn’t know anyone had come.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I mean, no one could have come into my house. Because I was there. No one could take my sister from my home—whether it’s a dog or even my own uncle.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Don’t use insults.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Did Narin see something she wasn’t supposed to, Mr. Enes?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : All right.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It’s not an insult, Enes. Calm down. Would you like it if someone insulted you here? You complain about the gendarmerie insulting you. Let’s not do the same, all right? All right, apology accepted. It’s not a contradiction, it’s a question.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz ​\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Around 9 p.m. on the 24th—that is, three days after Narin disappeared.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : There was a fire.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : And there were also frequent power outages. Were such things common in your village before?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t really know about the power cuts. I had come back on the 20th. On the 21st, my sister—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I mean, two or three months earlier, were there power cuts in the village?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, there were. The circuit breaker would trip, and we’d go and reset it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Sometimes there are always outages in Diyarbakır.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Could you describe the fire in more detail?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Let me explain the fire to you in detail, brother. Because I was there when it happened. The fire—well, there was Ömer Güran and a friend of his. We were sitting near the mosque. Ömer Güran was talking either on TikTok or with a sheikh, saying there’s water flowing in front of a house door and a broken tree. So we said, there’s Hacı Rıza Güran’s place—it could be there, because there’s a broken tree and water in front of the door. We went to check. We looked around everywhere, found nothing. And at the moment we were about to leave toward Hacı Rıza Güran’s garden and enter near Erhan Güran’s house, the wires hit each other. I was standing under the wire outside the garden, not inside. Then suddenly, the fire started. When they tried to extinguish that part, it spread to my side. It happened four or five times in a row, my Lord. Which fire should I try to put out?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, no one’s accusing you of that. The issue here, Enes, is the claim that the fire was suspicious—that it was organized by Salim or others to destroy evidence, since it wasn’t a windy day and there was no natural reason for a fire. That’s why the attorney is asking.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Look, Enes, I’ll speak frankly, with the Presiding Judge’s permission.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course, go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Narin disappeared on the 21st.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : On the 23rd, there were conflicting statements about the exact time she went missing.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Okay.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : I’m listing this chronologically.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : On the 24th, there was the fire.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : On the 26th, you were sent for a forensic report.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Then on the 27th, there was a fight among the women.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : There were many women, as the Presiding Judge already asked.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : All these are suspicious events, aren’t they? Don’t they seem abnormal compared to ordinary life?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I don’t really know.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : That’s why these questions are being asked.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Let me tell you about the fire again, my lawyer brother. The wires really did hit each other—no one struck them. Because I was standing right beneath the wire.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t see anyone hit it?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : No, all the wires hit each other. It happened on its own.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Enes Güran ​\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir ​\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : A truly incomprehensible investigation has been carried out—I’m struggling to find the right words. The prison conversations my client had with his family have been included in the file. These recordings even appear in the indictment, and all of them were deliberately included. They were intentionally leaked to social media—this case is entirely built on perception, and that perception is still being fueled.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Who released those recordings of the prison conversations?​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : We don’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There’s an allegation that you released them yourselves, to shape public perception.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Yes, yes, as if to create the impression that “Look, the family is laughing.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I don’t know. When I was asked, as the court, I said all videos are accessible to the parties, including the defense attorneys.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Their inclusion in the file is already debatable—that’s a separate matter. We didn’t object to it then, because everyone already knew everything. We didn’t want it to seem like we were hiding something. We have no such concern. We said, “Let it be discussed.” But we also want to state here that since these recordings constitute illegally obtained evidence, they should be removed from the file. Why? Because the conversations were cut and edited. If the full conversations were listened to—there are two calls—one with his brother Eren, and one with his six-year-old brother. In that call, he says, “Don’t talk to anyone.” But if you listen to the beginning, it’s about normal things—“How are you, brother? I’m fine,” he says. “I’m working here, don’t worry.” Let’s not forget—his six-year-old brother lost his sister. The whole family was devastated. His mother was detained, the child lost his sister, one brother is gone, and the father is completely exhausted. So trying to protect the child from others’ words is a human reaction. Taking only that sentence—“Don’t talk to anyone”—out of context to twist it is unfair. The indictment itself is forced. Soon we’ll show many examples. For instance, the question about the phone and WhatsApp—you’ll see what it really means. Everyone will understand. The precedent cited here is from the 18^th Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation, 2016. In that case, a convicted person insulted a deputy director during a prison call. The trial court convicted him; the Court of Cassation overturned it. The Chief Public Prosecutor appealed under Article 308, and by majority vote—not unanimous—a ruling was made. It stated: “If a person is detained or convicted, they are under the state’s supervision. Monitoring is permissible to prevent or detect crimes.” But that’s to prevent a new crime, not to prosecute a person already in custody. Our situation is entirely different.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We’ll review all of that.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Article 135 of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly regulates this. These cannot be used as evidence. My client has already explained his concerns openly. Everyone listened to selective parts of the conversations—let them listen to all of them. If they’re public everywhere, let everyone hear the full context—how the child cried, how the family struggled to talk at first, and what happened later. We’re stating clearly that this is illegally obtained evidence. We didn’t object at first, but as you’ll see throughout the case, there are multiple such examples. This is one of them, and we’re formally objecting to this evidence.​",

    "text": "Presiding Judge ​\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, the indictment has been delivered to you. You’ve read it and are aware of the accusations against you.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have attorneys. To remind you again, you have the right to answer or not answer the questions. You also have the right to remain silent. Will you testify in the presence of your attorney? I’m listening. Go ahead.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : As usual, I wake up early in the morning. We had hired an irrigator, on a percentage basis—eight percent.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Please speak a little louder.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : After that, every morning, we go to the field before them or together. When I go, I don’t just sit around. I work. I’ve been a farmer for as long as I can remember—everyone knows that. That day, I woke up in the morning again, and we went to the field together and worked. I went to the well between Karakoç and Tavşantepe—there’s one there, and another below. We sat up there, ate, drank, sat around. Around 10 or 11, I came home. I told my children, “There’s a wedding. Let’s go buy you some clothes.” Except for my son Devran, we all got in the car. We went to Diyarbakır Bağlar Family Health Center and bought clothes for them. On the way back, before reaching the police checkpoint in Çarıklı, I stopped at the Opet station and got TRY 200 worth of fuel. Then I headed from Çarıklı toward the village. We got home around 2:45–2:50 p.m. It was hot. They turned on the air conditioner. My wife prepared food for me. I ate, then lay down to rest for about an hour or an hour and twenty minutes. After resting, I got up, got in the car, and went back to the upper well. While I was there, two electricians came. I asked, “What’s the matter?” They said, “There’s a malfunction in the transformer belonging to your uncle Mehmet Şerif Güran’s son. We came for that.” I said, “Yes, that’s true, it’s been sparking lately.” They said, “Come with us.” The field road was rough, and their car was old—a blue Şahin. They sat down and even ate some watermelon. Then we went together. At Mehmet Şerif’s field, the transformer wasn’t near the car; we had to walk quite a distance. I walked through the cotton plants. I know cotton; I’ve been a farmer all my life. I checked and saw that worms had started appearing on the cotton. I called my cousin and said, “My cotton looks good, but unfortunately it’s infested. You should spray it.” He said, “All right, cousin.” He called again later and asked, “What should I spray it with?” I said, “Buy Krojen.” So we talked on the phone—spray insecticide and so on. Meanwhile, Abdulsamet and the other electrician—whose name I forgot—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It’s in the file. I don’t recall either, but it’s not important.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Anyway, Abdulsamet climbed up the pole. The other one was collecting weeds.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Hasan. Hasan.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Hasan was collecting weeds. He was picking them. I was walking through the cotton, checking the plants. Then Abdulsamet came down and said, “Salim, call your cousin. I won’t do this repair for less than three and a half thousand.” I said, “Why should I call him? You call.” So he called. They negotiated, and the price went down from five thousand to three thousand. Then my cousin Mehmet Şerif called me and said, “He agreed to do it for three thousand.” I said, “That’s fine, three thousand is reasonable.” He said, “I need a long stick.” I said, “Where am I supposed to get you a long stick from?” He said, “Let’s go to the well where we’re staying—maybe we’ll find something useful there.” So we went there together. When we arrived, they found what they needed and left. I didn’t go with them. My son Miran was there. I took my son Miran and went home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Around what time was that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : When I got home, it was around six o’clock.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So around six.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, about six o’clock.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you were in the field until then?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Of course, yes. Then my uncle Hüseyin had come from Mersin. I hadn’t seen him yet. I went home, grabbed a device we had, and put it in the car. My son Miran said, “Dad, I’m coming too.” I said, “All right, come along.” We went to see Uncle Hüseyin. My aunt Fatma had also come. I greeted them respectfully. While I was there, Ramazan Atasoy called me. He said, “Brother, there’s a suspicious vehicle near where you came from.” I told my uncle, “There’s such a situation.” My nephew Osman said, “Uncle, I’ll come too.” I said, “No, don’t come.” I dropped off my son Miran. You can see my son Miran on camera—he’s walking up the path. I drove by the school. As I was passing by the side street, I saw Nevzat Bahtiyar among the trees. I passed by without even greeting him. For the past two and a half, three months, I haven’t sat with this man, eaten with him, drunk coffee with him—nothing. He shouldn’t lie. Since the incident with Arif, neither has he called me nor have I called him. I knew he was upset with Arif because Arif refused to pay him. Arif said, “You’ll pay this money like a donkey,” he said. “How can you not pay?” He insulted him harshly. I said, “Arif, that’s inappropriate. Why would you say that?” Since that day, we haven’t sat together. If we were such close friends, why doesn’t he stop by and sit with me? He passes by every day, and so do I. I don’t even greet him anymore. I know he was offended by Arif—and by us too. About the construction issue: when Arif said that, I told him, “Nevzat, we’re going to build your house anyway. We’ll have Feyzi do the plastering. You’re a plasterer—come and do it. My father will give twenty thousand, I’ll give twenty thousand, and Arif will give forty thousand. That makes eighty thousand.” He agreed, went to look at the house, then called me back and said, “He said one hundred fifty thousand to you, but told me two hundred.” He said, “I won’t do it for less than one hundred ninety.” I said, “Come on, that’s not right. You told my brother Memduh one hundred seventy-five. At least do it for one seventy-five. I’m giving you an extra twenty thousand.” He said, “No, I won’t do it. Give it to whoever offered one seventy-five.” I said, “Then I’m not giving you the twenty thousand either.” I told him that directly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. One moment—it says the session is closed, right? The recording will be fine, yes? Okay.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : On the day of the incident, I was in the field.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When did you first learn that Narin was missing?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : When I was with Uncle Hüseyin—around 6:30 or 6:40, I’m not sure, approximately. Ramazan called me. I went there—the two grandsons of our former village head were there. A white Chevrolet was driving around in circles. It’s visible on the police station’s camera. I said, “What’s going on?” They said, “We’re learning to drive to get our license.” Then I went there again. I took my phone and went there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, you went there. When did you find out about Narin?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : When I got there? We went there—what time was it then? Around six something?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Around six-thirty. All right.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Between six and six-thirty, maybe seven.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, around seven.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : After that, I didn’t stay put. I can’t sit still. I’ve been walking around cornfields since I was a child. I climbed up a pole and took a photo—took a picture of the corn from up there. I called Mehmet Selim Atasoy. He came to me. Then we went around checking the corn again. When we came back near the cooler, I got a phone call. My daughter Gizem called me. She said, “Dad, Narin is missing.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Gizem?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, my daughter Gizem.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, I just wanted to confirm.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : She said, “Dad, Narin is missing.” I said, “How could she be missing? Look around, I’m coming.” Mehmet Selim Atasoy said, “Brother, wait, I’ll come too.” He was there with his two sons—Ramazan and the younger one, whose name I don’t recall. Mehmet Selim Atasoy took a flashlight since it was already evening. We went together to the house. I parked the car there and saw that all the villagers were gathered.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So that’s when you found out.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s when I found out. When I got the call, I came and saw it was serious. I immediately called Sergeant Şakir before anyone else even made a report.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : At 20:18.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes. I said, “Commander, my niece is missing.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Now, we learned something new here as the court panel. There’s a voice recording app on your phone—why did you install it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Sometimes I go to meetings and forget the time.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : So I record the time and address to remember them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then why did you delete it? You just said you’re forgetful, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You’re the village head, correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let’s talk about this region specifically. I’ve been here five years and learned how things work. In a village like yours, for soldiers, police, and the villagers, you’re the first point of contact, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then that app would have been useful after Narin went missing. Someone could’ve called and said, “Mr. Headman, I found her here,” and it would’ve been recorded. But you deleted the app on August 22nd.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t delete that app. I didn’t touch it. They told me—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Look, others may object, but according to the data, on 08/22/2024 at 00:31—half past midnight, the night Narin went missing—you disabled the app.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You disabled it around midnight, the same night she disappeared.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t understand that app.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Look, Mr. Salim, I told Enes he’s a smart boy. And I’ll tell you—you’re a smart man. You could outsmart half the people here if you wanted.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : God forbid.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, let me explain what I mean. You installed that app yourself, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I told you the name of the person who installed it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s not important. You had it installed, and you understood how to use it to record things. The app would have been most useful after the incident. So why delete it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It’s still there. I didn’t delete it from the screen.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But according to the digital report, the app itself was disabled. Look, I’m reading your call logs right now. At 20:01, “Hello, where are you? I’m by the well. I’m coming now. I can’t hear you. They’re saying Arif’s girl or someone went missing. What happened? I’ll call you back, I’m coming now.” That’s from the app’s log. Then you called the commander.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Right, those were around 8 p.m. that day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And that night, you disabled the app.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t disable it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But it was disabled. That’s very suspicious.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I swear, I didn’t disable that app. Whatever it shows, that’s it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment—the recording froze.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, there’s just a system error.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Restarting the recording. Let me clarify: during Salim’s testimony, the SEGBİS system froze, so the recording was restarted. If any technical issues arise, we’ll address them using the secondary camera. All right? Geylani, take note of that. Mr. Salim, I’ll ask again—you didn’t intentionally delete or disable that app, correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you don’t know how it got disabled. After the incident, about 15–20 days later, did you ever check if the app still worked?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I didn’t know. Sometimes the storage was full, or maybe the signal didn’t connect.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Everyone, a bit quieter please.​\n\n\nAt this point, due to overlapping voices from the presiding judge, attendees, a bar association representative, and one of the plaintiff’s lawyers, parts of the audio were unintelligible.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, let’s start again from the top. About this app—​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I want to speak.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t understand that app. I was sitting in the courtyard of Cahit Kaya, my father-in-law’s brother. His son, Şeyhmuz Kaya, installed it for me. While we were having tea, I mentioned that sometimes the app didn’t record calls. He told me it’s because it doesn’t record when there’s no signal.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But afterward, your phone clearly had signal—you were reachable. If you didn’t disable it intentionally, it should’ve still worked.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. So you’re saying you didn’t disable it intentionally. But the phones seized from you had deleted call logs and erased WhatsApp history. Why?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Because I had talked to prostitutes—escorts. I deleted them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But you didn’t delete everything. The escort messages are still there.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I thought I deleted them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Maybe you talked to more than one. I don’t know. Deleting that would be understandable. But you didn’t delete those—you deleted the ordinary messages. I’ve seen it in the file.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Who knows that?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It’s in the case file. You deleted messages you shouldn’t have, while the incriminating ones remain.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s all I know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s another suspicious act. Mr. Salim, as I said before, you’re an intelligent man. As a village head, you’re also experienced in handling investigations. Correct? In Diyarbakır, most investigations are conducted through the village head. This missing person case was also managed largely under your direction. I’ll come back to that. Now—you deleted your WhatsApp chats.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You say you did it so the escort conversations wouldn’t be exposed.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, I deleted a lot.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But the escort conversations remain.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I thought I deleted them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t. So, who do you think killed Narin?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t see who did it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When asked before, you seemed to suspect your stepmother. Is that correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : For example.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, I mean, when you were first asked who you suspected, you said your stepmother and your step-siblings.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Let me explain, Your Honor. They brought something—what do they call it?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : A sorcerer?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Not a sorcerer exactly, there’s another word for it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : A talisman maker? I don’t know what you call it here—what?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : A “blow healer.” (Üfürükçü)​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : They brought one. They brought him. He said it’s somewhere around there, around Nevzat’s house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t go to the “blow healer” yourself?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The healer came—that’s different. Let me explain.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ah, so that’s a different healer. There’s also one you went to.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I’ll explain that too.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Go ahead.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t take him there. The security forces took me. I can even give you their names.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Fine, yes, go ahead, give them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I will. Then there’s also Nedim Kaya—Gazal’s brother. I said, what should I say? I swear I don’t believe in such things. I said, “Nedim, you deal with it.” He kept taking the man around—around my mother’s house, around the garage. That’s how it went…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But if you don’t believe in such things, why did you tell the gendarmerie you suspected your stepmother because of it? Look—you said you suspected even your stepmother, based on something a healer did whom you don’t believe in.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s true.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yet for about 15–20 days, there’s no sign that you suspected Nevzat.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t suspect him. But when the gendarmerie called me, they asked, “Do you have any conflicts with anyone?” I said, “No, we have no issues.” They said, “Even if it’s small, tell us.” I said, “Well, maybe with Nevzat Bahtiyar, a small one.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So “small.” You’re saying it didn’t seem important?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes. After what happened with Nevzat in my house, they told me they asked Arif—he said, “No problem, I paid my money.” So I thought there was no issue with Arif either.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Who is Birsen to you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : My uncle’s daughter.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Your uncle’s daughter.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And Melike is also your uncle’s daughter. Did you tell them to testify that they saw Narin at 17:40?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Never. They changed their statements under beating. That’s not true.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Your cousin says otherwise.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t even talk to my cousin. Why would I tell her what to say?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then why would the gendarmerie beat them just to accuse you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Your Honor, there was something called “trace evidence” in my car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We’ll get to that. Step by step. So, why would the gendarmerie force them to accuse Salim? Why you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : They changed their statements after I was taken into custody.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But why Salim? Why not Arif, Fuat, or Erhan?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Ask them, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I will. But I’m asking you too—they said it was Salim.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t say anything.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t say anything. I didn’t talk.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t talk. Yet in the gendarmerie’s records, it says you kept redirecting them elsewhere, which was seen as suspicious behavior.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Who am I to direct the whole state?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, not that.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : They wouldn’t even let me stay in one place—one took me out of the car, another put me in.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, I’m not saying that. I know what you’ll say. You’re the muhtar, right? I said earlier that investigations are conducted through the muhtar. Don’t say “who am I.” Investigations are done with those who know the area.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Who was coming to the muhtar? Who came to the muhtar?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I wasn’t even eating.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Fine. But why did you keep mentioning suspicious things to the gendarmerie—like “there are gypsies,” “a red car,” “a Syrian tent”?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I’ll explain that too. They asked how many wells there were. We went around checking the wells. When we reached Hacı Mehmet Emin Kaya’s place, they all suddenly ran off. I asked, “What happened?” No one said anything. The cars sped away. I said, “Take me too.” They said no. Then I saw a foreign transit van up ahead—I raised my hand and said, “God, let me go with them, where are our people going?” I went to the tent area, to where the gypsies were. Who organized it? The muhtar. The last one to know—also the muhtar.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now wait—so you’re talking about two gypsies.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Two gypsies. That first evening the village was crowded. People said, “Two gypsies were seen near the irrigation canal at the village entrance.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Who told you that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : They were saying it among themselves in the crowd.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And you passed that on to the gendarmerie.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I didn’t. Why would I?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The gendarmerie wrote in their report that they heard it from you. Everyone knew the rumor, but you, as the muhtar, also passed it along. It wasn’t something you saw yourself—just what you heard.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Someone said, “Muhtar, we saw two gypsies.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And you told the gendarmerie.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said, “Maybe those gypsies brought the child to the village?”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t see them—you heard it and relayed it. Now, there’s another point: the HTS analysis, which the defense disputes. According to that report, you were near Arif Güran’s house at 15:19, and entered the house at 15:20. You claim you were in the cornfield at that time. Did you ever enter Arif Güran’s house?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you see Nevzat on the day of the incident?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Around 6:40 p.m., while walking down the street, I saw him among the trees, near the door of his house. I passed by without greeting him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : At 6:40? Wasn’t he supposed to be going to his sister-in-law’s to get cheese at that time?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : When I was going to Uncle Hüseyin’s, it’s visible on the school camera. He was there at that time.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you saw him, it caught your attention, but you didn’t greet him.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t even greet him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Have you ever entered Arif’s house?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But the cell tower data suggests you went as far as the empty room across from the kitchen.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Our house is only about 30–35 meters away. If my signal reaches there, then there are three other phones in my house—check their data too.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why check theirs?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Then they’d show the same, because I was home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But you said you weren’t home.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I left for the field around ten to four.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You went to the field.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Check Bahtiyar’s data too—he’d show up in the bathroom, excuse me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Who is Dilek?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : My daughter.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Dilek.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What’s her legal name?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Rezan.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Rezan. At 15:39, you had a WhatsApp conversation with Rezan.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s my daughter, she called.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You don’t remember. At 15:45, Rezan called again—this is from the deleted WhatsApp data. Enes’s phone also connects to your house at 15:57.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Our houses are close, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did Enes come to your house before you left?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He didn’t come while I was home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Have you ever witnessed Enes having a relationship with one of your daughters?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. Never saw or heard such a thing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you have any relationship with Yüksel?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. I would never disgrace or dishonor my brother’s family. I am Salim Güran. Your Honor, she’s a forty-five-year-old woman—my brother’s honor is my own. Am I such a low, immoral man to bring shame on my brother’s name?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then who killed Narin?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Your Honor, are you asking me who killed Narin?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I’m asking if you have a guess.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Narin—clearly, Nevzat Bahtiyar took her and buried her. All right? Nevzat Bahtiyar, did you kill Narin? Who killed her? Speak up like a man.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Look at me while you speak.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Think of the afterlife too. You’ll burn in the fires of hell.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Look at me.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes. Don’t lose your eternal life for this short worldly one. Speak up like a man.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He said, “I didn’t kill her, I just took the body and hid it.”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It’s all a game—he’s lying about everything.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : From your point of view, do you think Nevzat is even capable of planning all this?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, but let me tell you, Your Honor, I was taken into custody.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The man prepared himself watching TV.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But you’re saying he’s not capable, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : What?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I asked if Nevzat is capable of planning all this—you said no.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : But the TV told him everything. He arranged everything in front of the television.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, if he could arrange everything, why would a man who’s supposedly framing you also accuse Yüksel and drag her into it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He’s slandering us, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why? If his goal was to save himself, wouldn’t it make more sense to accuse only you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : How could I kill Narin, an eight-year-old angel—she was like my own daughter, Your Honor?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : According to the allegation, because she saw the affair.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He’s lying—may God punish him. There’s no such thing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No such thing. Then why did you delete your WhatsApp history and phone data?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Your Honor, like I said, I deleted them. At the end—I mentioned that the security forces took me to the healer.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : While I was there, 380 Kalashnikov bullets were found in my brother Arif’s barn. Everyone was calling nonstop over WhatsApp. That’s why I deleted it too.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s why you deleted it. Okay. And the Mehmetoğulları—what are they to you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Efendi Mehmetoğlu.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There’s also Taner Mehmetoğlu. In the WhatsApp group, he writes, “Give the guns to the women.” He says, “There’s going to be a search—hide the guns and bullets with the women.”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I’m not connected to that group.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t know about it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I had no idea. This is the first I’m hearing of it, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t know about a group called “Narin WhatsApp Group”?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Absolutely not. All right. So, you deny the cell tower data too?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Were you aware of the women’s fight?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No. I was in custody during whatever they said.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you don’t know what they said?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because when they were arguing, Erhan—or was it Fuat?—yes, Erhan—was covering their mouths, telling them to be quiet, separating them.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I have no knowledge, Your Honor. Ask them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We’ll ask them too. But let’s ask you as well. Did you ever direct witnesses? Tell them to “speak the truth,” or coach them to protect yourself?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. I never said anything like that to anyone. Never told anyone what to say.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We asked about your WhatsApp messages, your phone, why you didn’t bring your phone. On the day of the incident, there’s a voice call with Nevzat.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I never called him. Never.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There’s an incoming call at 17:46—41 seconds.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t call him on WhatsApp, Your Honor. He didn’t call me either. Never.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have the right to deny or remain silent, but—​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I’ll answer, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : This is a serious allegation in the file. The WhatsApp data shows a call at 17:46 on the day of the incident.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Did Nevzat Bahtiyar call me, or did I call him?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He called you.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s absolutely false. No such thing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What about Vecdi or Vedat?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What do you say about that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He’s been calling me since then—asking, “Did you find her or not?” He kept calling.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : After that, he had conversations with Nevzat. Are you saying that wasn’t you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t talk to him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you ever give instructions to Nevzat through him?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. No such thing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The child is missing. The entire Tavşantepe is searching for Narin. Everyone is looking. Yet during that short window of time—22:47—you supposedly went to the site where the body was found.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. I didn’t go.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t go. Yet it’s claimed that you left the area at 22:55.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : We were searching everywhere like dogs—two or three times over.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But there are witnesses.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t leave the village that night.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There’s also evidence that a car went there. We’ve determined that Nevzat’s red car went to that spot. There’s footage showing a red car. The camera shows a vehicle going there at night, matching your cell tower data—showing you at the site at 22:47. According to the prosecution, someone went there that night. We don’t know what car it was—maybe a Renault, maybe a red one. Later, about a month afterward, data entered the file placing you there. So, are you saying the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office conspired against you? Someone drove there, and they decided to pin it on you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Your Honor, I swear, I never went there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then why would the Diyarbakır Prosecutor’s Office make such a claim against you? What did you do to them for them to frame you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Your Honor, they insulted me, humiliated me—everything.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But look, Mr. Salim, they didn’t accuse Yüksel of this. They didn’t accuse Enes. They didn’t accuse Erhan. They’re saying Salim went there.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Are you a traitor to your country?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Never.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then if you’re not, from your point of view, why would the Diyarbakır Chief Prosecutor’s Office fabricate such an accusation against you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t know. You’d have to ask them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : They say they’re not fabricating anything.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Then where did that car come from, if the camera caught it?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It was nighttime when the camera caught it. The car isn’t clearly visible. It’s just a small section where a vehicle enters. It’s unknown—it was dark. Because it was nighttime.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I have three fields in the village. One of them is close to the creek—about 300 to 400 meters away.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, there’s DNA found in your car—right under the driver’s seat, exactly where you sit.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What do you say about that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That car isn’t mine. Just as my aunt Yüksel said earlier—it belongs to my nephew. We brought it with İmran to the house. He said, “Uncle, Devran had an accident.” It’s a ’94 model Broadway—God spared him, he almost died inside. He said, “You use it, and when I sell it, you can give it back.” I agreed. I drove it for about six or seven days. Then in Çarıklı, near the driller’s shop, İmran Berat and Kurtuluş came to me. They said, “Uncle, we’ve sold the car.” Ali came and took it. Within two days, I was left without a car. I was going back and forth on Mehmet Selim Atasoy’s motorcycle or by minibus. Later my son Devran said, “Dad, Uncle Fuat went to Van with the tractor, he’s working under the harvester. Let’s use his car and go to the field.” I said, “Does it even run?” He said, “We’ll get it running.” An electrician came and started it. I went to Diyarbakır, it stalled at the office and wouldn’t start again. I found a man who helped me jump-start it. Then we took it to the electrician in Çarıklı—he said the battery was dead. We charged it. Even while the car was at the mechanic’s, we called from across in Gönen. They said, “When the battery’s ready, bring it back to us. Maybe we’ll put it on Fuat’s car and use it ourselves.” The door was broken, the window too. The kids rode in it every day—my kids, Arif’s kids, Fuat’s kids—all of them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, but even if they all rode in it—​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That very day, my four daughters were with me—without headscarves. We went to the Bağlar Health Center, downtown.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, but the DNA was found under the driver’s seat. Now, according to the allegation—let me restate it—Nevzat said there was foam coming from Narin’s mouth. Could it be that when you touched her, some of that foam got on your hand, and when you entered the car, you wiped it onto the seat?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Or maybe from the blanket—did you touch a wet part of it? I asked if it was wet; he said no. Could you have wiped saliva from a damp part of the blanket onto the seat?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Your Honor, there’s no such thing. And where did this blanket story come from anyway? I bought TRY 200 worth of fuel at the gas station.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, TRY 200.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : TRY 200. My whole family was in the car—my wife in front, my kids in the back. Someone said I bought three packs of wet wipes there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t even get out of the car. Someone else claimed they saw Narin’s body wrapped in a blanket. They said all sorts of things—none of them were true.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When you say “not true,” what do you mean?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I mean there’s no such thing. None of it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, social media… okay, okay, fine. Yes, now I remember what part of the indictment this refers to. I understand now, thank you. So, to summarize before giving the floor to the judges and the prosecutor: according to the indictment, there’s a DNA trace in your car. According to the HTS data, you entered Arif’s house. And at the crime scene, based on the report, between 22:47 and 22:55, you were there for about eight minutes.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. No such thing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So none of this is true?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Not true.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t influence any witnesses?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t deliberately mislead the authorities to keep the evidence from being found? You didn’t direct them to, say, the red car instead?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And you didn’t deliberately disable the voice recording app on your phone?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then you deleted the WhatsApp data, but the escort messages accidentally remained. All right. Do you have any questions?​\n\n\nAssociate Judge : Mr. Salim, it’s established that there was a voice recording function on your phone and that recordings from it were included in the case file. You’ve already admitted to using such an app and recording conversations due to your forgetfulness. Can you hear me now?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, no—just record.​\n\n\nAssociate Judge : This microphone records, all right. I’ll speak more quietly then. You said you used the voice recording program on your phone to help yourself because you sometimes forget things.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, I forget sometimes.​\n\n\nAssociate Judge : The use of this program is confirmed, and the recordings are in the case file. I have two questions about these recordings. First, in your conversation with Ramazan Atasoy, you say there was a suspicious vehicle near the field. You said he informed and warned you about it, and that’s why you went to the field. However, when we listen to the recording, it sounds more like talk about a sprinkler—or something being stuck in a sprinkler up on the hill. So your current statement doesn’t match the content of the audio recording. Can you explain this?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Look, Your Honor, as I said, I took a device from home. I took it when I went to Uncle Hüseyin’s place. When the phone rang, I thought it was the TEDAŞ (electric company) team calling. I went there—it wasn’t them. It was the muhtar’s two grandsons. Then I went to Ramazan Atasoy. We have a device we use two or three times a week. Otherwise, the farmers can’t manage the electricity.​\n\n\nAssociate Judge : So the conversation you mentioned with Ramazan—was it about this device, or about the suspicious vehicle?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It was about the suspicious vehicle—he said there was a suspicious vehicle.​\n\n\nAssociate Judge : All right. My second question—according to the recordings in the file, you mention several different times for when Narin went missing: “since sixteen,” “since sixteen thirty,” “since fifteen,” “since seventeen or eighteen,” “since nineteen.” In calls starting from 20:01, the missing time changes each time—by nearly half an hour. Why is that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Just like I said earlier, Your Honor, it was crowded—one person said they saw her at five thirty, another said five forty, another said six. So I spoke based on that.​\n\n\nAssociate Judge : Yes, the statements mention five forty. There’s Maide Kaya’s statement, İsa Kaya’s too—all after five thirty. Where did “four o’clock” come from then? Who told you that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Maybe I said it, but I don’t remember. I don’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What time did Nevzat call you? At fifteen—15:08?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He called me about the water issue.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So that’s true.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, he called about the water. He said, “My water’s not coming.” But if one person’s water doesn’t come, usually fifteen or twenty people in the village, men and women, would all call me. Strangely, it was only him. The water comes to the whole village from one main pipe at the tower. Why is everyone else’s water running, but not his?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why didn’t you suspect something then, but you do now?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I mean—at the time, I didn’t think much of it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But you suspect everything else—you even suspected the healer.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He could check whether his water was coming or not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Mr. Salim, you—who suspected the healer—why didn’t you suspect Nevzat at the time and ask for him to be investigated?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He didn’t call me again after that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You’re not answering my question. You, who suspected your stepmother based on something from a healer you didn’t even believe in—why didn’t you suspect Nevzat over this water issue?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t investigate that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t suspect him. Then Vedat kept calling too, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, Vedat—or Vejdi—kept calling, asking, “Did you find her or not?”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And despite all this, you never suspected Nevzat?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I told the security forces. I said there had been some trouble between me and Nevzat about the car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The only detail in the file connecting you to Nevzat is the red car. You mentioned a red car somewhere.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I never said anything about two gypsies or a red car. Did I even talk to such a person?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It’s not about talking—you told the gendarmerie that two gypsies passed by in a red car. The only red car we have in common is Nevzat’s. You have no other claims about him.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t know that red car. I never said that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So someone else said it.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It was something people were saying about the gypsies.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : They were saying it, I see. Any questions, Your Honor? Madam Judge? Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any questions? Go ahead.​",

    "section": "Trial Prosecutor ​",
    "text": "Trial Prosecutor ​\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Salim Güran, the issue of the red car that the presiding judge mentioned earlier also appears in the Kurdish-translated transcripts of your deleted recordings. Not once, not twice—several times. You even have conversations with the officers. You talk about an old red car, correct? Do you deny having such a conversation?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely. I don’t remember talking about two gypsies or a red car.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : All right, let’s see. At 15:08, when Nevzat called you about the water issue, where were you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I was at home.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : At home. How long did you speak?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He said, “The water’s not coming.” I said, “All right then.”​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You mentioned fixing the issue, reaching someone about it. Did you make any official call regarding the water outage?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So you stayed home until around 16:00.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I ate something and rested for a bit.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So you didn’t call anyone to fix the water?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, no one called me, and I didn’t call anyone.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : But Nevzat called you about the water.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, he did. No one else did.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : All right. After that, did you take any action to fix the water or report it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I didn’t.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Okay. You said someone else installed that recording app on your phone, correct? So you claim you didn’t delete it yourself.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Did the person who installed it delete it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No. I never asked anyone to do that.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : In the translated transcripts from the recordings, you mention someone named “Badin,” or Bahattin.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes. He’s a phone repairman. Yes, yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You thanked him quite a lot for fixing a button.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Ramazan’s phone had broken. Yes, that’s right. Badin Karatay—his shop’s in Karamuz. He said he’d repair it for TRY 900. It was at his shop.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You said things like “You’re a lion, a hero, well done for fixing it,” didn’t you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Because they had taken it to three or four other places, and no one could fix it—but he did.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Could he have deleted the app for you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It wasn’t even my phone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Could that Badin have helped you with that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, definitely not. It was Ramazan’s phone, and maybe it still wasn’t fixed then. I don’t know.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Now I’ll refer to the cell tower data. Around 22:00, on the evening Narin went missing, there’s a signal from near Dicle University. There’s supposedly a tea garden there. Do you know whose that is? Does someone from the Güran family run a tea garden there? There’s one, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, my uncle Güran has one there.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : The signal came from that area. You don’t have to admit anything—I’m just asking. Devran Güran and Muhammed Kaya came from the Derik district—Mardin Derik. When they arrived, their phones pinged the same tower.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s true—they went there to hand out cards.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : The timing overlaps with yours. That’s my point. You claim you didn’t meet anyone, but the tower data shows otherwise.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : The next morning—Muhammed Kaya is your nephew, right? You’re his uncle.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Did you see Muhammed Kaya that evening? They came from Derik, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, I saw Muhammed.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Then how can you deny my Dicle University point? Anyway—did you see Muhammed Kaya the night Narin went missing?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It was crowded—all my nephews were there. He was probably there too.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Do you remember? Do you recall? Hm? Do you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Most likely he was there. I don’t really know—there were hundreds of people.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So, along with the gypsy and Syrian claims, the next morning Muhammed Kaya supposedly found a slipper near the Syrian tents.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s true.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : True.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, all right. Please, no interruptions. Let’s maintain order.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You can respond after I finish. I just ask for courtesy.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Right—no interruptions. Thank you, counsel. Please proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You’re the one who mentioned the Syrians and the gypsies in your recordings. The next day, there’s a claim that a slipper was found near the tent—but the gendarmerie didn’t find one. Muhammed Kaya kept the slipper in his car for an hour and a half, claiming the Syrians had dropped it. Did you arrange that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. I have nothing to do with it.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : According to the tower data—again, you don’t have to answer; I’m stating the claim—you gave off a signal at 22:44 from the site where Narin’s body was found. When the gendarmerie and AFAD arrived and things got chaotic, the claim is that you went there and, after Nevzat said “I didn’t pile up brush, I just put one stone,” you added two more stones and branches on top. Is that true?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. Look, Mr. Prosecutor—ma’am—that stream isn’t a pond. It’s a long creek, kilometers in length. Is it a lake? A small pond? The area was searched eight times and no body was found. He hid it that well. Why would I be the one to find it?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t go to the creek at all, right? All right.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Earlier, the presiding judge mentioned the DNA in your car—which you denied. But according to the report, the DNA found in your car matches the DNA from Narin’s clothing. Do you understand the weight of that statement?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That day, Narin didn’t ride in that car.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Do you understand what that means? It’s not someone else’s hair—it’s DNA taken from Narin’s clothes on the day of the incident. A biological trace, not hair.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. That day Narin didn’t get into the car, because the car was with me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The prosecution isn’t claiming she rode in the car. The claim is that when foam came from her mouth, it got on your hand, and when you entered the car, you wiped it on the seat. Right, Mr. Prosecutor? There’s no claim that Narin was in the car—only that traces transferred from your hand to the car seat.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : There’s no such thing.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What I mean is, this isn’t about her randomly getting into the car that day — this DNA is a trace found on Narin’s clothes, formed on the day of the incident.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It’s not about whether she got in the car or not.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : After I left that car there, I didn’t get into it again.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, I’m just stating the allegation.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : My brother Fuat drove the car after he came back from work. Fine. I got into my nephews’ or my brother Kurtuluş’s car instead.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : When did you leave your uncle Hacı Hüseyin, who had come from Mersin?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Around 06:35–06:40.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Around 06:35–06:40. And at what time did you supposedly take Mehmet Selim Atasoy’s daughters somewhere?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I’m mixing up the 20th and 21st of the month.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So you actually took them a day earlier, correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : But your earlier statement said otherwise.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That was due to stress, I guess.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Mehmet Selim Atasoy called you, saying there was a suspicious vehicle. You were at your uncle Hacı Hüseyin’s house, correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Did you leave immediately?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I was sitting with my uncle.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : But you said earlier you left in a hurry.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I greeted them politely and left.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So you left right away?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : The moment he called?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The moment he called—within a minute or two, I left.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Mehmet Selim Atasoy called you at 18:27. You appear on the school camera at 18:57. That’s a 30-minute gap.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It wasn’t Mehmet Selim, it was Ramazan Atasoy who called.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : It’s registered under Mehmet Selim’s name, ending in 1521. Right? Yes. Officially under his name, but it’s Ramazan calling. At 18:27 he calls you. You appear on camera at 18:57. From Hacı Hüseyin’s place to there.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I left straight from my uncle’s house.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I see, but that’s still 30 minutes, not 2 minutes. You said you dropped Miran off right before that—there’s a 30-minute gap.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I left as soon as he called, that’s all I know.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Do you understand my question?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Miran went up the path, and I went toward the field.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : All right, but there’s a 30-minute gap. So you didn’t leave immediately.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I really don’t know.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : All right, Mr. President, thank you.​",

    "text": "Diyarbakır Bar Association ​\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir ​\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Mr. Salim, your son is Devran Güran, correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did you ever tell Devran to locate all the cameras in or around the village?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I told everyone — identify every camera there is.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Why did you take that upon yourself? Did you have an order from the gendarmerie?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I identified them all myself. I showed them to JASAT and intelligence. I pointed them out one by one — all the cameras, the roads. I got out of the car and checked. One of them — my brother now…​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did you hand over the location data to the gendarmerie? Yakup Tunç — did he send you coordinates through Devran? Did Devran send you the camera locations?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He sent one.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did you deliver it to the gendarmerie?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He sent it to the gendarmerie.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : But he sent it to you first, didn’t he?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : But he also sent it to the gendarmerie.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did he send it to you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No. I told him to send it directly to the gendarmerie.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : So you never received the file yourself.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : As far as I know, no. I told him, “Send it to the gendarmerie, why are you sending it to me?”​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : All right. Another question. Based on the contents of your phone’s data image, there’s a conversation where you say: “They saw her last at around three, three-thirty, maybe fourteen-thirty or fifteen-thirty. Around three-thirty, four.” In that conversation, you’re giving a time frame for when Narin went missing — and that call took place at exactly 20:46. So how did you know Narin had gone missing around three-thirty or four?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t know. I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You don’t remember.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The gendarmerie arrived early. They came and asked about the cameras. I said there’s one at the school.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : But searches began around seven o’clock.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Sabri Kaçan came. They opened the school camera footage.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Yet in that call, you said she went missing at three-thirty or four. How did you know that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t know. I don’t remember saying that.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : According to all the reports, searches in the village didn’t start until 18:30–19:00.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Maybe it was just talk — what people were saying.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Who told you that the child went missing at three-thirty or four?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You don’t remember. Could someone have told you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Then how did you hear that the gypsies might have kidnapped her? Who told you that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I just told the presiding judge earlier — I was the last one to go there.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : All right, but in your conversations, you give very specific details about the gypsies and the slippers. Who told you that? How did you know?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : My family and the villagers went there.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Can you name anyone from the village who told you this information about the gypsies?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I personally went there — I went to where the security forces were, to the gypsies’ area.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Let me repeat. Did one of your relatives tell you that the gypsies might have kidnapped Narin? Where did you learn that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You don’t remember. Did you give the gendarmerie any such information?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The gendarmerie went there before me.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : There’s no report of that in the file.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : There was a rumor about two gypsies — if I said that, I don’t know. I didn’t say anything else.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : All right. After Narin went missing — on the first day — did Nevzat ever call you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Not once? You didn’t call each other? Did you search together?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t notice him that evening, but the next day the villagers said, “Come, we’re opening the doors — everyone should help. We’re family.”​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did you search together with Nevzat?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He joined.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : He joined.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did you talk to him during that time?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You never spoke with Nevzat?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : We didn’t talk.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : But in his statement, he said, “We were friends for thirty years, very close.” Let me finish my question. Your wife also said, “They were like brothers.” And Arif, the victim’s father, said, “They were like brothers; they used to go to restaurants together.”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I only took him out for meat twice — we ate together those two times.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : That’s not what Arif said. What I’m asking is — given how close you supposedly were, didn’t it seem strange that he didn’t search with you or contact you afterward?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It was crowded that night. Maybe he joined the searches during the day. He went into houses himself.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : He never came to offer you any support or solidarity?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : So he didn’t.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : There are some WhatsApp records that were recovered — call history. They’re synchronized with the time of the incident, around when the act likely occurred. You had calls with Mehmet Güran, Mehmet Şerif Güran, and Nevzat Bahtiyar shortly afterward.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I already mentioned Mehmet Güran earlier. We were talking about the field. Nevzat Bahtiyar called me about the water issue.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Why did you speak with Mehmet Şerif Güran?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It was about the field and the school. The electricians had come — two of them.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Between 16:43 and 17:59 — a little over an hour.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s right.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Exactly five calls, totaling 353 seconds.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Correct. I said earlier — we spoke several times. He called me.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Were you at the field during those calls? The same field you mentioned?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, during the calls with Mehmet Şerif, I was at the field.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You were at the field.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : The electricians came, and you went with them.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : But they called you around 11 a.m. How do you explain this contradiction?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : They didn’t call me. I didn’t know they were coming. They just showed up. I saw them and said, “Oh, what’s going on?” They said, “Your cousin Mehmet Şerif.” I said, “Yes, the transformer — it’s faulty.”​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : But this was in the afternoon, not morning.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : So you didn’t meet with the electricians or go to the field in the morning?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No. I don’t know. I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : The electricians called you around 11, and at that time, you were in the village, not at the field.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : They didn’t call me when they came. They came without calling. They weren’t there for me.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : In your statement to the gendarmerie, you said, “When bullets were found in Arif’s barn, I deleted my WhatsApp records for that reason.”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Call records.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Right — you said you deleted the WhatsApp call records for that reason. But now you’re saying you deleted them because you spoke with sex workers. Which one is true?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Both are true.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Both are true. All right. That day, you went into the city center to shop. After shopping, you returned home with your family, correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did you rest afterward? Did you eat?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You ate, and then rested as well?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Then why didn’t you mention any of this in your previous statements?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I already said — we hadn’t eaten properly for 6–7 days. They’d bring me food, set it in front of me, and take me away again before I could eat. They were dragging me around like a dog.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : But you repeated this same statement at the prosecution and in the magistrate’s court.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes — let me explain. They brought me here early in the morning, around 1.5 hours before…​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You had a private defense attorney present. Their signature is there.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He came late. I was kept in that cell that smelled of urine for about an hour and a half — standing for 6–7 hours straight.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : But your statement was recorded after your attorney arrived.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He came later. He wasn’t there at first.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : All right. One more question before I finish. You said you used to talk to sex workers.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Weren’t you afraid your wife might find out? Was your phone at home? Would your wife or children look at it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I never talk on the phone at home.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You don’t. Doesn’t your wife check your phone?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I set a password.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : A password. Does your wife ever make calls from your phone?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Never?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Only to call Hediye or her sister. And my kids use it for payphone numbers.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Around what time does she usually call?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Whenever she needs something — I wouldn’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Thank you.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım ​\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Mr. Salim, how many times did you change your clothes on the day Narin went missing?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Clothes?​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Yes.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t change.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : But earlier you said you came home around two-thirty and changed.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I didn’t change clothes.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Just now you said—​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Right, sorry. In your statement to the prosecutor, you said you came home around two-thirty and changed.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Then later you said you went to the field and changed again when you came back.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I didn’t change my clothes.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : All right. Next question. There was supposed to be a wedding — invitations were being distributed. You had some task related to that, right? At whose house did you organize it, and with whom?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : With my brother Erhan and Arif. Arif called me and said, “Come, we’ll hand out the cards.”​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : At whose house?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : At Erhan’s house.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : All right.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : My stepmother was there too, and her family. No one else — it wasn’t crowded.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : I see. But in a previous statement, Arif said it was at Hüseyin’s house and that you weren’t there.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It was at Erhan’s house.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : All right. Was there ever a drowning incident in the Eğertutmaz stream or the DSİ canal before — any child who drowned?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I haven’t heard of any. I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Then why did you direct the gendarmerie straight to the DSİ canal?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The dogs went that way.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : Why not the Eğertutmaz stream?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The dogs went behind our house into that area. We spent three or four days around the canal. We called the authorities, had the water cut off. Before that, we entered the water ourselves to search.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : I understand.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : We took the dog there.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : You said you called Ramazan Atasoy about a device at the field. But Ramazan said you didn’t call him about any device. You were referring to an illegal electricity connection device, but he said no such conversation took place.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He told me there was a suspicious vehicle.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : A suspicious vehicle?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said maybe it’s the TEDAŞ team, and he said maybe too. I went there — it wasn’t TEDAŞ.​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : But when asked, he said there was no talk about any illegal connection or device.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : How would I say that on the phone — that there’s an illegal setup?​\n\n\nLaw. Derya Yıldırım : He said you mentioned a device, but that it wasn’t related to that — and that there was no such device in the field.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I went to Uncle Hüseyin’s place and then went further up.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren ​\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’d like to clarify something related to what my colleague — and the judge — asked earlier. The judge mentioned “sprinklers” in your recordings with Ramazan, but according to the expert report, that’s incorrect. The conversation is in Kurdish, and I’ll refer to the official translation. At 16:28.​\n\n\nspoken in Kurdish​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Could you translate it into Turkish as well?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The translation already exists.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Please read the Turkish aloud as well — some people here don’t understand.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right, I’ll read from the file now. “Something of yours fell over there,” it says. “Between the stones at the last bend.” That’s what it says. Ramazan says, “Yes?” Then you say, “Do you know what this is about? Some people reported there’s a body there.” Remember? “No? Maybe you saw it on TV — there was a report like that.” That’s the conversation. “Something of yours fell there — near the border, near the stones.” In Kurdish: [spoken in Kurdish]. Ramazan replies, “All right, I’ll go get it,” according to the translation. Most people here speak Kurdish — I can even play it. I just want to note that this was mistranslated as “sprinkler.” It wasn’t a sprinkler — the conversation was in Turkish.​\n\n\nSalim Güran and attorney Law. Nahit Eren exchanged a few sentences in Kurdish.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : There’s no mention of a sprinkler here. It says, “Something of yours fell there — near the stones by the bend.” So I’m rephrasing the question according to the official report in the file. And since Ramazan also denied it — as you did in your earlier defenses — and as the prosecutors later asked him, did you take any device related to illegal electricity from that place after this conversation? He says, “No, I had no such conversation, nothing about a device.” So I’m asking you now — what did you mean by “Go take the thing that’s yours that fell there”?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : We usually hide that illegal electricity device near the stones under the grass in that area. It might be that — nothing else. What else would I tell Ramazan?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So this conversation had nothing to do with Narin. Now that we’ve clarified that, let me continue. When we look at all your statements and the allegations in the file, we reach a clear conclusion. I’m basing this on the evidence. In all your defenses, you created a version of events in which, after returning from Çarıklı at 02:33 — or 02:52 according to the cell tower records — you appear to be outside the area covered by your home’s cell tower until 04:00. Why? Why did you say you went to Hüseyin’s house at 02:30? You said, “I came home, dropped off the kids, then went to Hüseyin’s.” I’m asking — why? Why did you go there?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I thought I went there around 02:30 or 02:40.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : And the reason for that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : We were in shock, exhausted.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That’s exactly what I’m asking.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : This statement wasn’t made on the day of the incident — I’m talking about the 29th.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Meaning, around the time you were arrested.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Even there, in your statement, you said, “Ten days after the incident…”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : They wouldn’t let me sleep. They kept me awake all night. They didn’t give me drinking water. I couldn’t think straight.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Mr. Eren, please continue with your questions. I also want to clarify something — since there were accusations against the Diyarbakır Bar Association. You said you were left waiting for an hour and a half during your statement. The reason was that every lawyer we appointed through the system declined the case. We couldn’t find one who accepted. Finally, the seventh one did, and your private lawyer arrived.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Couldn’t they have seated me for half an hour?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I can’t speak to that, but yes, there was about an hour and a half delay. As a Bar president, I can confirm that multiple lawyers declined the assignment, which caused the delay. Eventually, one accepted and went, and then your private counsel arrived. Now, you say you didn’t go to Hüseyin’s after dropping the kids home around 02:30. We agree on that. So where did you go?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : After speaking with Ramazan, I went to Uncle Hüseyin’s — within the village.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : According to the school’s security footage, you were seen near Hüseyin’s house at 06:57. You went there between 06:00 and 06:30.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So why did you previously move that event back to 02:30? You said it was due to shock. All right. But according to the cell tower data, at 02:52, you were still near Arif’s house. Didn’t you leave?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I was at home.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Is your wife lying, then? She said that after eating, you left about ten to fifteen minutes later. Is that a lie?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I ate, yes. But what time did we leave?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That’s what I’m asking — what time did you leave the house?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Around ten or fifteen minutes before four o’clock, you went up to the drilling site, right? The electricians came, right?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Up to now, you’ve said that before going to the upper area, you dropped off the girls in Uzunbahçe Village. So now, Salim Güran, you’re saying you stayed home until four, correct? But in all your previous statements, you said during that same time you were at Hüseyin’s, in Uzunbahçe, or at your father-in-law’s farm with Ramazan. Did you go to the farm that day with Ramazan?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : To the farm?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes, that day.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, we went with Ramazan.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You did. Then let’s reconstruct this together. You left home at four. After that, where did you go?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Let me explain. On the 20th or 21st — we dropped off his sister, then went to the farm.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That wasn’t the day Narin disappeared — that was the 21st, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It was on the 20th, he says.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The 20th, fine. As I said, I’ve reviewed all your statements and the witnesses’ accounts. You’ve compressed everything that happened on the day of the incident into a window between 12:00 and 16:00. So I’m asking: if those events actually happened on the 19th, not the 20th, since the HTS records show you took the two girls to Uzunbahçe Village on the 19^th, and Ramazan confirmed this, then tell us — what did you do on the 21th, the day Narin disappeared? Go hour by hour, as best you can remember.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said, when the girl came back from the market…​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You came home, had dinner. Your wife said you left right after eating — to go to the field.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said I’d rest a bit.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But earlier you said you left at four.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I left before four.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Before four. All right — what did you do next?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I went to my drilling site between Karakoç and Tavşantepe.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you didn’t go to Uzunbahçe?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I went there — the electricians came. Ramazan was there, and another man, I can’t recall his name.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Hasan. Hasan.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You didn’t go to the farm that day, right? You went with Ramazan?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Maybe we did, maybe not. I’m not sure — it could’ve been on the 20th.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right. In your earlier statements, you said you called Mehmet Selim Atasoy from the drilling site and asked him to come.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What time did he arrive?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He came a bit late. By the time I was leaving — around six.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Around 16:30.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He had just arrived then.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So around 16:00, according to Ramazan’s statement, you were at the drilling site. Do you remember Mehmet Selim arriving at the field then?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I told you — I went around six, and he came after me.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So Mehmet Selim Atasoy came around 18:00? What about the lower field — what time did he go there?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The lower field?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t go — I stayed there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You didn’t go. Mehmet Selim Atasoy says he went to the cornfield between Çarıklı and Tavşantepe.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It’s two separate plots — both down below.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What time did you send him there?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t send him. He went on his own.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He went himself. All right — in his statement, he says he came around 16:00, and according to the tower data, you went to the upper field at 16:10. Then Mehmet Selim arrived. You sent him to the cornfield to redirect the water flow, didn’t you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember sending him anywhere.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : At 16:28, Mehmet Selim says a vehicle was spinning its tires. Where? Can we play the audio, Mr. President?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course. Technicians, can we do that? Okay.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : At 16:28.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Does he remember this?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, it’s his own voice on the recording. Do you deny the phone recordings?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I’m just asking if he remembers.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you deny the phone recordings?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Atasoy says a car’s spinning its tires?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He says, “I can’t get the wheel out — it’s stuck.”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : What day was this?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The same day Narin went missing.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The audio exists — it’s in the file.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Ask him.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m asking you — you’re the one he’s speaking to.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said the wheel’s spinning?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, he said it to you.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He’s not denying it — he says he doesn’t remember. If he denied it, we’d play the recording, but he says he doesn’t recall.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : All right. Here’s what I’m getting at. Based on your statements and the file, when Mehmet Selim came to the field, he was acting as Nevzat’s lookout, wasn’t he?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. Never.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you didn’t send him to that field.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No. I hired them for irrigation. I just went there sometimes to help.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m not making this up — he said you sent him.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He acts on his own. He knows the irrigation better than I do. I just go and help.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Fine. Now let’s clarify the cell tower data. Since the defense also questioned it, I’ll explain for accuracy. Tavşantepe village and Eğertutmaz stream fall within the overlapping coverage areas of Sur, Bağlar, and neighboring villages. Did you review the narrowed cell tower report?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I didn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You didn’t look at it at all. The data shows that every movement between your house and Arif’s changes cell towers. The report tells us exactly who moved where. Because there are multiple towers, every movement is traceable. Since this is evidence, I’ll ask you based on that.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t know how that works. But if Nevzat’s phone connected there, and mine too, and Enes’s too, then everyone — my family, Nevzat’s family, the neighbors — must be there as well. How can my phone connect to somewhere I didn’t go?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : According to the report — I’m reading directly — at 14:52, you left your house.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Okay.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : After leaving, according to the data — please answer clearly — you went toward Arif’s house via the side road. You entered Arif’s house at 15:20.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s not true.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : According to the cell data, you entered, exited, and entered again.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I absolutely did not cross to the other side of the street. I got in the car, turned around, and left.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you left home at four o’clock then?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Honestly, I don’t quite remember — around four maybe. Not exactly four.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you don’t accept this cell tower data. Fine. My question is this — the WhatsApp call logs have been added to the file.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : As a report. The ones you deleted, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : My colleague asked earlier. I’ll ask you again in relation to the evening calls. We accept that you were home until four o’clock. Were all your children at home? What are your daughters’ names?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Devran wasn’t home.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Devran went to the creek.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : While I was resting, Dilan went from her aunt’s place to the drilling site. My daughters were at home.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So, officially recorded as Dilek, Rezan, Rojin, and Gizem — they were home. According to the indictment and cell tower data, after Ramazan left the house at 15:36, you called Dilek at 15:39 — you spoke for 16 seconds. Then at 15:45, Dilek called you — a 7-second call. You were in the same house. Why were you calling each other?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember, I don’t know. I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you didn’t have any calls with Dilek at 15:39 or 15:45?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Are those numbers the same?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let me tell you. Dilek — 0531 858 14 21. You called this number via WhatsApp at 15:39. Six minutes later, at 15:45, she called you back. You spoke for 7 seconds that time.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment, continue. I just need to handle something. Go on, Mr. Eren.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’d like you to hear this too, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then give me 30 seconds, please. Go ahead. Sorry about that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So, did you or did you not make those two calls?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You don’t remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Mr. Eren, I’ve arranged for the next witnesses to be brought in — at least five or six of them.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Are we hearing witnesses today?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : By God’s will, yes. We’re here until morning.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Your Honor, just a second — let’s stay focused. Every time I get into the rhythm, you break my concentration. Honestly, I lose the thread.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Everyone calm down. We’ll still hear the witnesses. If anyone wants to leave, we’ll excuse them after Salim’s statement. Go ahead, Mr. Eren.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you don’t remember calling your daughter at 15:39 and 15:45?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember, no. What would I remember?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You don’t remember.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It’s been two months. How should I know what I talked about?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : On the day of the incident.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But you were in the same house. Your daughters say they left around four o’clock.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I see. So you don’t remember whether you made those calls or not?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said I don’t remember.​\n\n\nMultiple voices from the complainants’ attorneys were heard simultaneously, making it indistinguishable.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : One more question. You went shopping that day. Your wife — pardon, Hediye, or rather Melek — said, “We came home and had dinner.” Do you remember what you ate that day?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I usually eat breakfast-type food. They must have prepared that for me.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You ate with your daughters?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No. I think it was me and my two sons.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So Dilek and Rojin, the daughters I mentioned, didn’t eat with you. Yet your wife says you left the house, while you claim you didn’t.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I rested for a bit after eating.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You rested. Did you see your children trying on the clothes they bought from the market?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Some of them changed and showed them.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you saw them trying clothes on. All right. My colleague asked earlier — I want to make this concrete. You said you don’t remember the calls with Dilek. At 19:22 — meaning about 15 minutes after you were seen on the school’s camera at 18:57 or 18:59.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Which camera?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The one near the school. When you passed quickly by Hüseyin’s house. That footage.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : That’s just the road we always use.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Sure, I’m not disputing that. My question is this — I want to remind you, since you said you don’t remember. You said earlier that Ramazan called you about a suspicious car, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How long did it take you to get there — to the drilling site?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Three or four minutes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : After arriving there, did you speak on the phone with Mehmet Şerif Güran?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Maybe you’ll recall if I give you the times. Again, these are WhatsApp calls — not the daytime 353-second ones my colleague asked about.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : At 19:22, you called him. At 19:34, he called you. At 19:38, you called him. At 19:40, he called you. At 19:41, you called him. And then he called you again at 20:37.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you or did you not have those WhatsApp calls?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : When I called him on WhatsApp, I also sent him the photo of the pump.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : During the day. What time did you go to the garden and take those photos?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : With the electricians?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes. You said you were home at four.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Around four, maybe five. I’m not exactly sure.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Four or five. Did you ever speak to Vecdin on the phone?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t call — he called me.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did he ever call you?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, he did.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : They asked you before, but I’ll ask again because the calls are sequential — you call him, then he calls Nevzat, then Nevzat calls you. I mentioned earlier that there were four or five calls between you. Do you remember the content of those conversations?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Look, Arif was there. I said, “Vedat keeps calling me nonstop.” He asked, “Did they find her?” I said, “No, not yet. Hopefully, they will.” Then Nevzat showed up. I said, “Look at that bastard — so that’s why he kept calling me.”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : As the village headman, did you witness all the searches conducted by the gendarmerie?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, it was very broad in scope.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : During the first week, since searches were conducted in the upper part of the Eğertutmaz stream, all the water from the DSİ channel was diverted there.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : And Eğertutmaz was supplied with water from the DSİ canal for about a week to ten days.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Were you present during that process?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How long did it take?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I went there myself. It’s a long distance — we cut off the water in two places.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How long did the DSİ water diversion to Eğertutmaz last? When did the water return to its normal flow?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : After the searches ended.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How long after? According to the file, where and how was Narin’s body found?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I have no information.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You never wondered where it was?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Should I have gone there from prison?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Not to go — I mean, there are images in the file. Through your lawyers, or on TV, you could have seen them. Did you ever have that opportunity?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you don’t know the exact location where she was found?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Even after she was found — because when you were arrested, she hadn’t been found yet — even afterward, you don’t know?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It wasn’t in a creek.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Can you picture the place where she was buried in your mind right now?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t know. I can’t picture it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You don’t know. You can’t imagine it. Let us explain — you haven’t seen it. Her body was left in a shallow pit, just beside the soil, a few centimeters from the surface. When the water from DSİ was diverted to Eğertutmaz, do you think that water reached over the place where her body was buried?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It must have.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : By how many meters?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : If it was a big flow and reached the pond, then it was already under the water.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What I’m trying to understand — since you were the village headman and part of the searches — I mean Narin’s body…​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t go to that stream. I didn’t take part in the search there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But you said the water was diverted there.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t go to that stream. I just heard they diverted the water.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You just said that searches were conducted eight times in Eğertutmaz — you said it yourself.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said it because my lawyer told me to.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That’s exactly what I’m asking about. Do you know whether the DSİ (State Hydraulic Works) canal water continued flowing into the Eğertutmaz area or not? A clear question.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Not exactly, but it flowed there for quite a while.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Between the 27th and 31st, to prevent Eğertutmaz’s water from causing damage in Çarıklı, excavators from the Diyarbakır Metropolitan Municipality were brought in to create a new flow path, working for four days to divert the water downstream completely. Were you involved in that?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Were you aware of it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Only that when we were recording with JASAT, from our village to Gönenli — on our way back toward Çarıklı — I saw the excavator working there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you saw the excavator working. Do you recall whether the DSİ water was still flowing into Eğertutmaz at that time?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You were asked this before, but I’ll ask again — according to the cell tower data, aren’t you the one who drove to the place where Narin was taken and hidden by Nevzat?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not. If I had gone, then the entire village would’ve gone.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yet the cell tower still places you there.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t know what a cell tower is, but I didn’t go.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What’s a cell tower? I’m here right now, right? My phone shows me here. It measures where I connect from. It can tell whether connections overlap between towers.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I don’t believe in cell towers.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You don’t believe in them, fine.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t go to Arif’s house. You’re saying I did.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m not saying that — the report says it. Now, let’s talk about when you first heard the news. I want the audio recording played. Dilek calls you. She says, “Dad, Narin… Narin is missing.” What did you say?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : What?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You didn’t understand at first — yes, the signal was bad, it cut off. You then told Mehmet Selim Atasoy, “Come on, let’s go.”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : It’s on the recording. Can we please play it? It’s in the audio file. May I play it for confirmation?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Play it — or just read the transcript. That’s sufficient, Mr. Eren.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’d prefer to play it, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The phone recorded not only the conversation but also the background sounds — people nearby, neighborhood noise.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Fine, I told you — Selim Atasoy came to the village with me. What are you after?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m asking you directly — is that dialogue correct? Is that dialogue correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I told you, he came with me.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you say, “Come on, let’s go,” or not? That’s what I’m asking.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He said it to me — “Wait, I’m coming too.” He left his two sons there and came to the village with me.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m not asking about the content — just to verify the voice. Let’s play it to confirm it’s you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : If you tell us the file number, we can open it on our computer.​\n\n\nThe court panel, defense attorneys, and complainants’ lawyers attempted to locate and play the audio file. Due to overlapping sounds, this part was not transcribed.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes. The female voice — around eight o’clock, correct?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The female caller — a small girl beside her says, “Grandpa.” Then the woman says, “Salim, Narin is missing.” Salim says, “How did she go missing?” The woman says, “Narin—” followed by static. Salim says, “Hello? Hello?” Then to someone nearby — “Mehmet Şirin, come with me.” That’s what I’m asking about — Mehmet Şirin.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you remember?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said I did.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Earlier, you said you didn’t. Shall we play the recording, Your Honor?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I told you, I went to the village with Mehmet Şirin. That’s when I understood Narin was missing.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The call was cut, right? You didn’t try calling again?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I went — it took about two minutes. I was already there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you fully understand that she was missing?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, we realized she was missing.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : How? What kind of disappearance made you go?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I was there within two or three minutes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No — I mean, how did you perceive it? What kind of disappearance did you think it was?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Answer properly, in a decent tone.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, no.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : If you don’t remember, say so.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said I remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Don’t say, “What are you after?”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I’d like to remain silent.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then say that — “I don’t want to answer.” That’s fine.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : If you say you don’t wish to answer this question, we’ll move on. Go ahead, Mr. Eren.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So is it this question you don’t want to answer, or all of them in general? If it’s just this one, fine. Do you wish to remain silent in general, or just on this topic?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Just this one.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, that’s fine.​",

    "text": "Ministry of Family and Social Services ​\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz ​\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Melike Güran gave a statement — you know her, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, she’s my uncle’s daughter.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Right. She said — and this is her statement, not mine — that you told her to say that Narin went missing at 17:40. Is that true?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Did you tell Birsen Güran the same thing?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No, I didn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Well, Birsen reportedly told her mother that you did.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Then why would they lie? Why?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Ask them why they’re lying.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : We will. But I’m asking you now — because they said you did.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : All right. Do you know that Hediye Güran changed her phone a few days after Narin went missing?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Who changed it?​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Hediye Güran.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I had no idea.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Okay. Now, according to Arif Güran’s statement — and I’m quoting — he said their relations with Nevzat were good, and also good with you. He even said, “We searched together.”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I told you already — I hadn’t spoken to him for two and a half months.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Salim, look at me.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : But your brother said, “We searched together — all of us.”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : After the plastering work on that house, I told him not to call me, and I didn’t call him either.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, you’ve answered that. We’ve asked three times.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Do you know Gazal Bahtiyar?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I do.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : She’s Mr. Nevzat’s wife. She said — and again, this is from her witness statement — that you and Nevzat called each other “brother.”​\n\n\nSalim Güran : There’s no such thing. That’s a lie.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : She also said that after Narin went missing, “They excluded us.” Referring to you.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : When I gave my statement, I said we were just normal friends — like with any other villager. They exaggerate it as “close friends.”​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : That’s your version, but Ms. Gazal’s testimony says otherwise.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : She also said that after Narin disappeared, the Güran family — mainly you — didn’t let outsiders in. For reference: Narin disappeared on the 21st, you were arrested on September 2, and she was found on September 8. Please keep those dates in mind.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So — is that true or not?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, that’s enough.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : These are statements taken for information. I’m just asking if they’re true. Why would they lie? The Chief Judge already noted there are about twelve contradictory statements in the file. You claim to remember only what benefits you, and you reject the rest — like the cell tower data.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Of course I reject it. Why should I accept something about a place I never went?​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : No need to get angry. Finally, Your Honor, I’ll close with one question. The Eğertutmaz stream — it appears three times in the file, and the Judge said eight. Did you go there with the gendarmerie for the searches — eight times?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I told you, I didn’t go there. I didn’t take part in the searches.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Şeyhmus Erdoğan ​\n\nLaw. Şeyhmus Erdoğan : Can you hear my voice?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, we can.​\n\n\nLaw. Şeyhmus Erdoğan : Do you ever carry a gun? Do you own one?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I have an official service weapon.​\n\n\nLaw. Şeyhmus Erdoğan : Because Mr. Nevzat stated in his testimony that you threatened him with a gun.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He’s lying. He’s making it up. He’s not afraid of anyone. Once, Gazal called me one evening — she said, “Hurry, come! He’s killed your brother!” I went to my brother’s house — he had entered and was hitting him on the head with a rifle butt. Hitting him! If I hadn’t arrived, my brother would have been dead.​\n\n\nLaw. Şeyhmus Erdoğan : After you learned about the disappearance, did you go home at all?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What?​\n\n\nLaw. Şeyhmus Erdoğan : After you learned she was missing.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Şeyhmus Erdoğan : Did you go home or join the search?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I went home.​\n\n\nLaw. Şeyhmus Erdoğan : You went home. You said your house and Arif’s house are across from each other. You did go home, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Şeyhmus Erdoğan : So you deny changing your clothes, correct?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He said he didn’t change.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Enes Güran ​\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir ​\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : There’s a document said to be retrieved WhatsApp data, but nowhere here does it actually say it’s WhatsApp. Where did that come from? It says in the document that a program was used to recover deleted data. After running that program, some call logs appeared. They show names and call durations — incoming or outgoing. The prosecution likely checked whether he spoke with Nevzat — and yes, it says he did, at 17:46:32. But when they checked the HTS records, there was no such call. So they assumed it must have been a WhatsApp call. There’s no technical data confirming that. I compared these calls side by side with the HTS logs — they are identical. The only difference is a time shift of 2 hours, 38 minutes, and 27 seconds. If you add that offset to all HTS calls, they perfectly match. Same durations, same order. Even the one said to be a WhatsApp call — 444 69 96 — is actually DEPSAŞ, the electricity company. So apparently they’re saying he called an electricity hotline through WhatsApp. Clearly, this isn’t WhatsApp.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, your question?​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Right. As I said earlier, much of this case has been shaped by perceptions. I have a small map here — we planned to prepare a larger one, but this will do. Here is where Narin’s body was buried. Can he show us where the cornfield is?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : The spot where Narin’s body was found — where’s the cornfield?​\n\n\nThe map was shown to the defendant Salim Güran, and he marked it.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : The area we shaded — is that correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : The yellow dot there — how far is it? Speak into the microphone, please. This is important because the so-called “narrowed HTS data” indicates movement toward where Narin’s body was found. But according to Mr. Salim’s HTS records, he was simply within the cornfield area. What is the size of this cornfield?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : About 135 dönüms.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So within 135 dönüms, it could be anywhere. But they interpreted that as “he went to the body.” That’s how they read the narrowed HTS data. There are many issues like this. Also, there’s a key detail in another conversation — apparently with the gendarmerie. It says around 3 or 3:30. What I understand is that everyone gave different times, which caused confusion — people even claimed to see things at times they weren’t there. Someone outside the core family said they saw a red car in the village around that time. Later, at 20:29, there’s another conversation. Do you remember such a talk?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t have such a conversation. Maybe they mentioned “gypsies,” but not a red car.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Whether knowingly or not, you gave useful information. There’s another recorded talk at 20:39 with a gendarmerie officer. The officer says, “We’re searching everywhere.” The gendarme asks, “Did you check the hill?” The reply: “Yes, commander, the whole village is out searching.” The officer says, “The hill’s camera?” and he replies, “Yes, commander, the hill’s camera shows it.” That’s key — you’ve lived there a long time, right?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : There’s a military base across the village, correct?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : How clearly does that base’s camera see your village?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Like a mirror — perfectly clear.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Really?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes. Unless curtains block the windows in Kamışlo, you can see people clearly. How could it not see our place?​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Did you ever request that footage?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : We’ve been asking — they won’t look at it. I told the judge, “Your Honor, I want that camera footage.” That camera would show exactly how Narin was taken.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : In your village, during weddings or when shots were fired, did that same camera record it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, one evening shots were fired. They came from the outpost and said, “It wasn’t us — it was you.” I said, “Bring the footage, then.”​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : That’s what I’m emphasizing. There are camera recordings in the file. I’d like to show two of them — four total, actually. They’re already in the file, but ours are low quality due to scanning. The key point is this: in one video at timestamp 12:00, it shows a vehicle turning left from the road below the school in Tavşantepe neighborhood toward the Diyarbakır–Mardin highway. So clearly, the cameras can capture not just cars but even people moving in the village. If they can report that, then more is possible. We once thought TÜBİTAK had those images — we hoped they’d clarify everything. They mention 03:00–03:30 in the logs. The gendarme was informed after 20:00. That means the footage exists. We know this. If it were reviewed, and as alleged you entered the family’s house, would that be visible?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : If instead you took another path — say, near the school, or the route Nevzat claims, to get a blanket — would that also be visible?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Of course. Everything’s visible. There are no blind spots.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : You’d know that better as the village headman.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I know it very well. Let them check — at the exact minute Narin walked up the path. Open that footage. Everyone will see. I’m ready.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When were you taken into custody, Mr. Salim?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : On the second. Then I was detained. Before that, they brought me in and out a few times.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You said you know all this very well, yet in your earlier statements you never requested those recordings.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I said they’d check the cameras. How was I supposed to know? They checked after six, when the sun was setting, and said “the sunlight blocks the view.” But when she walked up the path, the sun wasn’t even low — it was overhead.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t push for it because you thought the sun affected visibility?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Otherwise, I would have, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : It’s a very clear camera — I’ve seen it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, we’ll ask about it.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : One more question — did you ever delete anything from the listening or recording app on your phone? Did you deliberately erase any recordings?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I used to delete things before too.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So, just like clearing WhatsApp chats — part of your normal habit, not after the incident?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes, I used to delete them regularly.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : All right. Your Honor, I’d like to present this last point briefly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We’ll take it at the end — or now, if you prefer.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : So, about the 17:46 call — it’s actually the same as the 15:08 call. There’s only a shift of two hours, thirty-eight minutes, and twenty-seven seconds — even milliseconds match. Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You said earlier you didn’t go to the cornfield at night?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I didn’t. I went in the morning.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right. Proceed.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Salim Güran ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Your Honor, Mr. Nahit Eren persistently questioned my client about WhatsApp calls — in good faith, of course — and Mr. Mustafa Demir just explained politely. But here’s the crucial issue: since the prosecution couldn’t produce solid evidence against my client, they fabricated one. The document claiming to “restore WhatsApp call data” is a forgery. The HTS log for August 21 was copied entirely, and every timestamp was shifted by about two hours and thirty-nine minutes to create a fake “WhatsApp list.” For example, in HTS records, Nevzat called Salim at 15:08 — in this fake list, it appears as 17:46. There’s also a 444 69 96 call to DEPSAŞ in HTS — the same number appears in the so-called deleted WhatsApp calls. Can anyone call a 444 number through WhatsApp, Your Honor?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I’ve learned many things from this case. I’ll test that myself.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Please do — I already tried and couldn’t. 444 69 96 is DEPSAŞ’s number, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I’ll test it tomorrow.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Between 13:00 and 16:06, he spoke with his daughter Dilek. Do you know where? While shopping in Diyarbakır.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Are you making a defense or asking a question?​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : I’m clarifying, Your Honor — so the same mistake isn’t repeated against my client.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : All right, please sit. Two or three minutes for defense.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Add two hours and nine minutes — 15:39 and 15:46. There — that’s the tragic end of the supposed “recovered WhatsApp logs.” My client’s statement is clear: Nevzat buried the girl, then called Salim and said he’d done so. This entire theory was planted in the prosecutor’s mind. We’re stating this now so it won’t be repeated later. We planned to cover it in our defense, but we were provoked. Now, I’ll just ask a few brief questions. When was the last time you called Nevzat Bahtiyar?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Me?​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Yes. Approximately when? Not the day of the incident — just roughly.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : I’ve been in custody for two months. Before that, I hadn’t spoken to him for two and a half months. Definitely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did you ever talk with Nevzat Bahtiyar about women — flirtation, escorts, that kind of thing?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So you didn’t have that kind of closeness with him?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : In his first statements, Nevzat mentioned only you — not Yüksel. Later, he shifted to include Yüksel. Why do you think that is?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : He follows the media.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Exactly. On September 9, during Didem Arslan’s TV program, the “Salim and Nevzat” accusation was first broadcast. After that, Nevzat’s statements began to include Yüksel too. My client had said earlier — “He studied his lesson on TV for a week.” That’s what he meant. Now, why do you think Nevzat mentioned your name at all?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Why? They detained me. They said, “Your car — we need you.” Then my lawyer, Seda Tuğrul, suddenly quit — as if something was wrong. I have a daughter too. She quit and made it look suspicious — like she’d seen something. The media attacked me — everyone did.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did the late Narin Güran ever play with your children in front of your house? Did she ride in your car?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : In the evenings, yes, she’d play outside — sometimes she’d get in the car. She was a child. That old car actually belonged to my brother Fuat Güran. We all used it — me, Arif, and the others.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Was any of your car’s windows broken?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Which one?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The driver’s window — when lowered, it drops crookedly, head-first. Needs fixing. The other one doesn’t go down at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : The front one?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The rear right window — it doesn’t move at all. It’s broken.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Well, in Nevzat Bahtiyar’s first statement, he said, “We pulled up, and I took her through the right window.” The glass report from October 9 actually confirms my client’s version. I wanted to note that. Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you.​",

    "text": "Presiding Judge ​\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, the indictment has arrived. I already summarized it briefly this morning. You’re aware of the indictment. You have attorneys. You have the legal right not to answer our questions. You have the right to remain silent. As I reminded the other defendants this morning, you have legal rights. Yes, I’m listening to you. You are on trial for killing your daughter together with the other defendants. What do you say?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes. I’ll say this in front of everyone. My Turkish is not very strong. Sometimes I mix in Kurdish. Please excuse me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s fine. We’ll understand each other in Turkish and Kurdish, hopefully. Go ahead.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I’ll start from the morning. On the day of the incident. I woke up at five in the morning.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment — there’s noise, friends. The sound isn’t reaching the microphone clearly. Let’s be a bit quieter. Yes, quieter now. Let’s all be quiet. Go ahead, Ms. Yüksel.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I woke up at 5. At five I went to pick okra in my garden. I picked the okra and came back — looked around, and saw a dead turkey in front of the house. I said, “The dog must have eaten our turkey.” I came home around six, six-thirty, woke up Osman, and sent him to work in Ongözlü. When Arif had come home late the night before, and his mother returned from the bus station, he’d said, “Yüksel, wake me a little early in the morning. I’m going to Batman.” So, in the morning, I went to pick okra, sent Osman off, and went into the kitchen. I was so happy — two or three of my sons had come home from working abroad. I was cooking, frying things — I couldn’t get enough joy from it. Then my other children started coming downstairs one by one. While I was finishing breakfast, I told them, “Wake your father and your older brother, have them come down.” Then I saw Arif talking on the phone with Muzaffer. I don’t know who called who. He said, “Yüksel,” and told me, “Muzaffer will come for breakfast.” I said, “Okay.” Muzaffer came. We left the table as it was. I was so happy that day. Something inside me said, “I could die now. Osman is the only one missing from us. May God not accept my wish. This is our last joyful breakfast.” I’m telling this to everyone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why do you call it your last breakfast?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Because afterward, they poisoned our lives.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ah, I see what you mean.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I’m saying this before everyone. After breakfast, Muzaffer, Arif, and Baran left together. Muzaffer and Arif were going to Batman. Baran was taking his wife shopping. Then I told my son Enes, “Go take a bath.” Because Enes is young, he forgets things. I saw from the statements he mentioned events out of order. After Enes came out of the bathroom, I also washed Narin and Eren. Then I called my sister. I said, “My washing machine is broken.” Hediye— no, my sister Salihe Güran. I called her and she said, “Sister, I have two loads of laundry. Bring them after noon.” Then I called my sister-in-law, Hediye Güran. She said, “Bring them.” I told Enes, “I’ll take the clothes to Hediye.” She said, “Okay, bring them.” All the clothes belonged to Enes. I took them to Hediye Güran’s house, carried them into the kitchen. She said, “Sit,” but I didn’t sit.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you remember what time this was?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Morning. I’m talking about before noon now. In the morning, Narin was still at home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. Narin was at home.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes. When I came back from Hediye’s, Narin and Eren were playing on the balcony. They were very happy. I went inside because my other children were home. I did my chores. Sometimes Eren or Enes and Narin would run to me: “Mom, when are we going to buy clothes?” “Mom, will you buy me a wedding dress?” “Mom, buy me this.” I told my daughter, “Okay, dear. I promise, I’ll buy it tomorrow.” May God not forgive them — they didn’t let me buy her that dress. Then she’d run to her brothers: “Brother, why didn’t you bring me a toy?” “My boss didn’t pay me yet, but I promise, when I get money, I’ll buy one for you.” I finished my chores and washed the balcony. When I looked, my older sons were happy inside. I turned off the water pump. My uncle’s daughter-in-law had come from Batman; she was staying at my sister’s. I said, “Let me go and say welcome.” I went — they were in the kitchen drinking tea and coffee. I sat with them; they brought me coffee too. I drank it, sat a while, then Ferhat Kaya came and said — I think it was Enes or Eren, I don’t remember — he said, “Mom, come home, we’re hungry.” I went home, because we had a wedding soon. When I got there, Muhammed had a music device and was playing songs. I took Narin and Eren by the hand, and we danced a little.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, Ms. Yüksel, when you went out of the house for these things, did you take your phone with you, or leave it at home?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : My phone stays at home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Always at home?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Always. When Muhammed and Narin are home, my phone is always there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because the children play with it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes. When I go out — to the yard or garden — they stay home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I go out.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So the children play on the phone?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, that’s why they’re quiet. The phone was with them. Then Narin said, “Mom, we’re hungry. Make us fries.” Luckily, I made them. I fried potatoes and gave some to my daughter. I was preparing lunch. I saw Muhammed and Narin fighting over the phone. I took it away. When we sat down to eat, they started arguing again. I remember this clearly. They kept asking me the time — “What time is it?” I looked at the clock; it was 1:00.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, Ms. Yüksel, how many people in the house had a phone?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Everyone in the house had one.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did Narin have a phone?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Only Muhammed, Narin, Eren, and I shared one phone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So Narin didn’t have her own?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, she didn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : When we sat down to eat, I remember it well. I looked at the clock; it was 1:00. We ate, I washed the dishes, vacuumed the rug, and sat on the couch. I saw Narin dusting the TV. She glanced at the clock. Because the night before, when we visited Hüseyin Güran, Hatice told her, “Come tomorrow — we’re going to Qur’an class.” She glanced at the clock and said, “Mom, I’m late for Qur’an class.” I said, “Don’t go, it’s too hot.” I tried to stop her, but she insisted. “Please, Mom, it ends at 4:00, and then I’ll go to Hatice and Fatma’s.” I said, “Don’t go. Your uncle is sick.” I couldn’t convince her. She convinced me instead. She got up happily, shouted with joy, and said, “Class ends at 4, then I’ll play with Hatice until evening.” Normally, kids in the village go out at 5 and stay out till dark — we have to drag them home. She went to Qur’an class. I even told her, “Dear, you shouldn’t go out with those legs.” She said, “Mom, I’ll change my clothes.” I swear — when Narin walked out of that room, I never saw her again. Enes and I were sitting together; he was playing on the phone. Nothing seemed unusual. Enes even said, “Mom, if my boss doesn’t pay, how will we afford my brother’s wedding before he goes to the army?” I said, “Don’t worry, your father will handle it.” I was tired — I’d been up since five. Enes had come home at midnight. I lay down; I don’t know how long I slept. When I got up, Muhammed was asleep, Enes was asleep, and Eren was playing on the phone. I went to the kitchen, drank some water, came back, and lay down again. When I woke up again, Muhammed and Eren were awake, Enes was still asleep. They told me, “Mom, aunt Hediye brought our clothes.” I said, “Why didn’t you wake me?” They said, “Aunt Hediye didn’t let us.” I was tidying the room. I don’t remember if Muhammed went out then. Enes woke up after that. I told Hediye, “The boys told me you came while I was asleep.” She said, “Yes, I came, but you were sleeping. I said, ‘Let her rest.’” The water pump is near the headman’s gate. I ran it, got water, and went to turn it off. Hediye came again; we sat and talked — about clothes, the wedding, Baran’s military service. Then I remembered to get Enes’s suitcase and clothes from the room. I was folding them when Enes’s phone rang — I think twice. I didn’t let it wake him. He answered and spoke to a friend. I asked, “Who was it, son?” He said, “My friend.” He also asked his aunt something, and she asked him back. Then Enes went out. I don’t know how long he stayed out. Hediye and I kept talking. I didn’t check the time. I just know it was toward evening. Then Hediye said, “I’ll go home.” We went to the door. Then I saw Enes coming.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, when Hediye came, was Enes at home?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The first time Hediye came, we were still sleeping.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The second time she came, I was up, but Enes was still asleep. We sat for quite a while. While I was folding his clothes, Enes’s phone rang and he got up.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So Hediye was there.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes. Enes was still home. I said, “Who was it, son?” He said, “My friend.” I told him, “You’ve slept enough, get up and get some air.” He went out. I don’t know when exactly. Hediye and I kept talking. Later she said, “I’ll go home.” We sat for a while after Enes left. I can’t remember how long. The police kept asking me, “What time was it?” I said, “I don’t know, I didn’t look.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We’ll ask the same — what time it was.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s possible.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I never looked.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Even now you might not know what time it is. But since we’re comparing times and minutes, we have to ask. You’re right, but so are we — because we need those details.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t look at the clock.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s fine. You might not have.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You might not remember.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I saw Enes coming, and Hediye left. I asked Enes, “Where were you?” He said, “By the fountain.” He mentioned the mosque too — I don’t recall exactly. I went to the kitchen, saw Enes go into the TV room. I told him, “Call your father — where is he?” When he called, his father said, “I’m in Batman, in Melkişköy.” I said, “He won’t make it for dinner.” I already knew Baran and Sultan were going to eat at uncle Kurtuluş’s that evening. I put the meat on the stove and tidied the house a bit. Around then, Enes must have gone out. Later, the officer asked me, “Did you see Salim that day?” I swore, “Commander, I never saw him.” Then I remembered — when I turned off the power switch, I could see Hüseyin Güran’s gate. Hüseyin and his sister were there. I think it was Salim I saw there for a moment — just a second, standing by the gate. Then the commander asked again, and I said I wasn’t sure — but maybe, for that second, I saw Salim by Hüseyin Güran’s gate.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You think so. Are you certain? Or not?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He was there, yes, he was there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you speak with Salim that day?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, no, absolutely not. I swear, I swear.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Ms. Yüksel, did you see Nevzat?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You mean you didn’t go downstairs and come back?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did Hediye see Nevzat?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We don’t go to Nevzo’s side, to his house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I know you don’t, but when you went outside — I watched the videos around your house — did you look around when you stepped out?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No. We didn’t look at all. We never saw them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t see them.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, I swear. I turned on the water pump. I washed the balcony. I cleaned up a bit around the house. Our garden has drip irrigation — I sent water to it. Then I went back inside, tidied up a bit, since the kids mess things up. Then I went up to the roof to lay out the bedding. I heard Enes and his friends talking — voices were coming from there. I went downstairs, left the rice on the stove, and ran outside. I saw Eren coming from that direction too. I said, “Son, is your brother still there?” He said, “Yes, Mom, he’s there.” I went and saw Enes and two brothers — Ufuk and Furkan, I always mix up their names — the older one was there, maybe Yusuf or İsa, I can’t recall exactly. Yes, both were there. Enes didn’t seem to think much of it. They were smoking. I don’t know if Enes smoked or not — I didn’t see it in his hand. I said, “Son, shame on you. What are you doing to your lungs, smoking like that?” They both came over.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let me ask again. In Diyarbakır, “smoking” might not mean regular cigarettes as we understand them. It was just a normal cigarette, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : A normal cigarette.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Not marijuana?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, Your Honor. Later, they spread rumors on TV — they said cigarettes, tobacco, heroin. Forgive me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because in Diyarbakır, when someone says “I smoke,” it can mean marijuana.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : But we just call it a cigarette.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The defendants also say “cigarette.” They say, “We smoked a cigarette,” but by that they mean marijuana. They call marijuana “cigara,” and regular cigarettes “sigara.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Show TV was there at the time too. It wasn’t even late yet. Then everyone started accusing me — saying, “Yüksel, you said tobacco, you said heroin.” I called over a reporter — Büşra, I think her name was — and said, “Come fix this. I said cigarette, not that.” Show TV called again and said, “Yüksel, when you say cigarette, we mean tobacco.” They even told me, “There’s not much difference anyway.” That’s what they said. Then I called Enes. Enes came. I told him, “Son, in the evening I’ll close the barn window. The dog ate our turkey — I’ll put the rest of the turkeys in the barn.” Enes came and helped me. We closed that window.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Let me step in. There’s more of this later anyway. What you’re saying now matches your earlier statements on this topic.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Correct.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ms. Yüksel, in your TV interviews—​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In those interviews you said things like, “Whoever killed her, just put her somewhere, at least let us know where the body is.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I never said that. I swear I didn’t. There were always people around us. I always said, “God, death is sweet compared to this.” Because my daughter was eight years old and missing. The whole country was searching for her and couldn’t find her. I said, “Death would be sweeter than this.” When someone dies, there’s at least a grave. My daughter was nowhere. The whole country searched and couldn’t find her. That’s what I meant. Whatever I said, they twisted it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : They may have, that’s why we’re asking.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, that’s what I meant — that death would be sweet compared to this.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I’ve noted this down. In Gazal’s statement dated 28.08, she said: around 19:00 on 28.08, who came with her? Enes was there, and also someone else. She said Yüksel came around 19:00, hit her knees and said, “Which of you took my daughter? Whoever took her, bring her back, even if you just leave her somewhere, at least let her grave be known.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No. Absolutely not. I swear that’s a lie about the time — 19:00. I told my lawyers that too. They said “seven,” but I didn’t understand. For example, seven o’clock.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Seven. 07:00. Between 07:00 and 08:00 on the day of the incident. Yes.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Let me continue up to that point, then. Yes, until it’s complete.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Where was I now?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where were you last? After the smoking — we’re past that. Cigarette, turkeys, yes. You were at the barn.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Enes came. We closed the barn window. I put the turkeys inside for two minutes. Then I went to the headman’s house. Because Melek’s father had eye surgery. Nazan was there. Dilek was there. Gamze was there. I went and said, “Get well soon. How is your father?” They said, “Thank God, he’s fine.” While we were talking, I said, “I’d better go — my rice will burn.” I ran home. When I got there, I saw Muhammed coming from that direction, Eren coming, Enes too. The kids said they were hungry. I said, “Muhammed, we’re calling each other from the hilltop — call Narin, tell her to come home.” I ran to the kitchen. I think it was Eren — I said, “Son, set the table.” As I was putting the rice on the stove, Muhammed came into the kitchen and said, “Mom, Narin isn’t there.” I said, “What do you mean she isn’t there? Narin went that way.” He said, “Aunt Hediye said Narin is here.” Then I called Hediye. She said, “Yüksel, Narin isn’t here — maybe she went to Damla or Ecrin or Yasemin or Gül.” I went up the hill. I sent Enes and Muhammed down and said, “Go to the mosque, Narin must be there, bring her back.” It never crossed our minds that Narin was missing. I called up to Maşallah on the hill. Maşallah said, “Yüksel, Narin isn’t here.” I said, “Tell the girls, Narin was going to visit you.” He spoke to them, but I couldn’t hear the girls’ voices. He said, “Yüksel, I swear, Narin isn’t here.” I didn’t know she hadn’t gone there after noon. I thought she might have gone, then left. It didn’t occur to me she was missing. She hadn’t gone to the mosque either. Then my sister Süveyla was there, filling hay. I asked, “Did Narin go to İbrahim’s daughter’s house?” She said, “No, İbrahim just came back from the hospital with his daughter. Where would Narin go? Either to Hediye’s or Yasemin’s.” I called Hediye again, since I’d already called before. She said, “Yüksel, the girls haven’t come yet.” I told Eren to get Yasemin’s number — I didn’t have it. Eren and Muhammed were there, I don’t remember exactly. We called Yasemin. She said, “Yüksel, Narin isn’t here.” I called my sister Saliha Kaya — I knew her number from Eren’s phone photo. Her daughter answered and said, “Aunt, Narin hasn’t come here.” Then I thought of her aunt Azize Kaya. Azize had told her, “Narin, don’t go — we’ll go together in the evening.” I ran there, knocked on Azize’s door, asked, “Did Narin come here?” She said, “No, Yüksel, she didn’t.” I got scared. I said, “The mosque is big; it’s under construction. Maybe she was playing there and got hurt.” I ran to the mosque, banged on the door with both hands: “Open the door! Narin is missing!” People gathered around. I saw İsa Kaya beside me. He said, “Yüksel, Narin was here at six.” When he said that, I relaxed a little. I thought, “She must be with her school friends, playing with the carrots.” We all started searching — up and down, everywhere, looking for Narin. We couldn’t find her. Even Gazal, Nevzo’s wife, came with me, comforting me: “Don’t worry, Yüksel, nothing’s wrong. Maybe she fell asleep somewhere.” I remember it clearly. She said she’d once fallen asleep in a field overnight. She was trying to calm me. Soon everyone in the village was looking for Narin — every hole, every pit, every dangerous place, we checked. I don’t know who called the gendarmerie, but suddenly the world came crashing down on us. Everyone was on their phones, calling each other. It felt like the whole world had come into Tavşantepe.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t kill Narin?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear, how could I kill my own daughter?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then did Salim kill her?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It never crossed my mind.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Could Salim have done it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Could Nevzat have done it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It’s unclear. I’m not defending anyone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What do you mean unclear? Nevzat isn’t saying “I killed her.” He says Salim killed her. Salim did it. I took her. Yüksel saw it.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : If Salim did it, or whoever did it, I leave them to God and to you. You should give them the heaviest punishment.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Could your son have done it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ms. Yüksel, from the beginning, the records state that your statement was taken in Kurdish. In those records and in the TV interviews you participated in, you always say things like, “We recited Yasin. Whoever killed Narin, let them bring her body, at least so we know where she is.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, absolutely not. We never said that. I swear, I have never said anything about killing Narin. As I said before, there was Hüseyin Kaya. He said at around three o’clock — I know a few minutes after that — a car came honking fast and stopped in front of our house. My mind was completely on that car. I said to myself, “Narin must have come, or someone has kidnapped her.” We even mentioned the Bingöl girl — I swear, I had lost myself completely. My family laid me down on the couch. Then my sister-in-law came and said, “Yüksel, get up, someone is asking for you.” I barely got up, and a woman came, hugged me around the neck, and cried. I was already crying. She said, “My mother is bedridden and sick. I lost my brother. Go to Yüksel’s side.” I didn’t even recognize her. Whoever came would throw themselves at me crying, and I cried with them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, let’s change the topic a bit, to refresh our minds. Were you aware of this argument among the women?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No. At that time, I was inside the ambulance.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The women, apparently, shouted insults at you — saying if you had told the truth, things wouldn’t have come to this point. They looked at you and called you names like “whore.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, I didn’t see anyone. I wasn’t even myself at that time. Commander Hülya came. I had already heard her name on television before. That gendarmerie officer — I knew by then something had happened to Narin. My aunt kept saying, “It’s not certain yet, it’s not certain,” trying to comfort me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The gendarmerie officers concluded that you were trying to protect Enes. Because in the reports, it says the mother seemed to be trying to protect Enes — wondering, “How can I save Enes? How can I protect Enes?” That’s their impression.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I’ll explain that too. I was at the police station. Excuse me, I went to the restroom. Commander Hülya came in with me. She said, “Yüksel, I’ll come to your house tomorrow. Tell them you’re on your period, and take me into your bedroom. I’ll tell you something.” I said to myself, “God, what is this commander going to say to me?” She didn’t come the first day, but came the second day. Same thing — she went to the restroom, I took her into the bedroom. She said, “Yüksel, in Ankara, there’s an apartment where your photo is. Enes’s, your whole family’s, and your husband’s photos are there. I’ll kill all of them. They are mafia — a big mafia. And they’re all asking about you.” Excuse me, I’m ashamed to say this in front of people, but I’ll say it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Go ahead, don’t be ashamed.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I have to. She said, “We’ll rape Enes, throw him in front of the door. I’ll kill Eren, I’ll kill him, I’ll kill him all.” I’m not exaggerating — that’s what she said. I was terrified. I kept saying, “God, what will happen to my children? What will happen to Enes?”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Does that sound logical to you?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : That’s what she told me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. But what kind of hostility could you have with a mafia?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : That’s what she said to me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ms. Yüksel, if I told you something right now, would you believe everything I say? Why did you believe that officer’s claim?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t believe it. Maybe that’s why — because my son was small. I was inside the station.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Didn’t you say, “What business do we have with the mafia? We’re just villagers”?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I did say that. I was saying, “God, what mafia is this?” I was in shock.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So after that, you started thinking, “How can I save Enes?”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I was at the station. There were ten gendarmerie officers around me — all those officers.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What’s the name of that commander?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Commander Hülya. That’s what she told me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Commander Hülya.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She told you that.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, she did.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And after that, you started thinking, “How can I save Enes?” So that’s the reason you said that — right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I was scared. For example, at the station, I had come to know all the officers by then. Enes would be taken to another room with a prayer book in his hand. I’d ask them, “How is Enes?” I even begged the commander, “Please, let me hug my son once.” My children were innocent. Why would I be afraid of my own children? Why would I protect them?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The claim is this — they interpret it as: Enes killed Narin. And in this region, boys are considered valuable. Narin is gone, but at least don’t let Enes go to prison. That’s the claim.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear, there’s no such thing among us.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, hold on. You have the right not to answer this question. If Enes had killed Narin, would you hand him over with your own hands?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear, I would.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No one in this world was as precious to me as Narin. I had another daughter, Tülin — she was seven when I cared for her. She never called me “mother,” never once asked me for food. She was disabled. When she died, I gave all my love to Narin. I had five sons, and their father too — we all adored Narin.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is that why you named her Narin?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, the other one was Tülin, this one is Narin.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why did you choose the name Narin?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : My other daughter was named Tülin.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, I understand that.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We named her Narin because she was so precious to us.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I see. So that’s why you called her Narin.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes. We all loved Narin deeply.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I understand. Now, let me ask again — those statements like, “Whoever killed her, let them bring her body, at least let us know where she is, at least let us know her grave” — what was the reason for those words?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I absolutely never said such a thing. I swear, I didn’t even say it like that. The whole country was searching for Narin — digging everywhere — and they couldn’t find her. Our pain was unbearable. I said, “Death is sweet compared to this.” When someone dies, they have a grave. Where is Narin? She’s an eight-year-old girl. That’s what I meant.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you may have used those words, but not in that sense.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you’re not denying saying the words, but you’re saying the meaning behind them wasn’t what people think — right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes. I only said, “Death is sweet compared to this.” The whole country is searching for my daughter and can’t find her.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Now, Ms. Yüksel, there’s this HTS analysis report. Your attorneys object to it. We’ll decide at the end of the trial whether it’s valid or not. According to this report, your phone was at home.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, my phone was at home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Enes’s phone was also at home.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I don’t know if Enes took it or not. Maybe Muhammed took it. I wasn’t using the phone at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : At 15:20, Salim enters the house.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Absolutely not!​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Listen now.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He absolutely did not come to our house!​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You’re saying Nevzat is the one who killed her — that’s what you said, right? According to Nevzat’s statement — and you said “that’s what Nevzat said” — Nevzat claims he came to your house. The base station data also shows that Nevzat entered Arif’s house. But the same base data shows you were at home, Enes was at home, and Salim also came to the house.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear, neither Salim nor Nevzat came to our house. They may have walked around outside the house — we didn’t know. We were sleeping at home, I swear.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You weren’t sleeping at 16:00. You were awake at the same time they were supposedly walking around the house.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : What time was that?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Around 15:30 — half past three.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Three, fifteen. We were at home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, you were at home, awake. If they were walking around the house, wouldn’t you have seen them?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Even if they came around the house, we were inside. It was hot. The air conditioner was on. The windows were closed. How would we see or hear anyone?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But there must be shade outside.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, we couldn’t see. The windows—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In a village, don’t houses have shaded areas visible from the window?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Whoever comes outside, how would we know? We were inside, sitting or lying down.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What kind of village is this?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : There are no houses around ours.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Exactly. Since there are no nearby houses, you’d be even more curious if you heard a sound outside.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We were inside. Until Hediye came, we were lying down. We didn’t go out at all. I swear, we didn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t hear any footsteps, voices, nothing outside?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Cars? Any car at all?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I’ve given statements a thousand times. If I’d heard or seen a car, I’d have opened the window to see who it was.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let me ask another claim — did you have any kind of relationship with Salim?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No. I swear, I swear, I had no connection with Salim. I swear on the Qur’an.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, Ms. Yüksel. Let’s assume Nevzat is lying. I’m reading from the accusations — the entire indictment, the defense’s claims, and those from the Diyarbakır Bar Association. I’m not accepting or rejecting any yet, okay? We’ll explain our reasoning in the verdict later. For now, let me ask — when you went into the barn, did you see your son in an inappropriate situation with someone?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you see him with another girl?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you see any sexual act with an animal?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, no, no. My children are intelligent boys. There’s no such thing.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t witness Enes doing anything like that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. Now, about the relationship between Salim’s family and Arif’s family — I mean family relations, not sexual relations — was everything normal between your families?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We had no problems at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Was Salim Güran the head of the family?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Salim is the head of his own household. Arif is the head of his. Only Salim owns some farmland. No one is the head over anyone else’s home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Understood.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is it possible that Nevzat is slandering Salim?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : They know. God knows.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : God knows.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : God knows.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : God knows everything. Is it possible that Nevzat is slandering you?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Of course. He’s definitely slandering me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s what I was going to ask. Why? Why would Nevzat slander two people at once? If he just said, “I killed her, and Salim gave me the body,” he’d only implicate Salim. Why would he also drag you into it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Let me tell you something — he’s an idiot. Salim killed a chicken, and in two minutes, he becomes an accomplice.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Seven minutes.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : How can someone become an accomplice in five minutes?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We’ll see.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I want to get out of here. I want Narin. I want the reason for Narin.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Hopefully.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : They didn’t let me. Your Honor, I wanted to dress Narin in a wedding gown, but they wrapped her in a shroud. They dressed my daughter in a shroud.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s why we’re here.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : They destroyed our dreams. They destroyed our home. They stained my honor. I’ve been married for 22 years. Go ask anyone in that village. Check every phone. Anyone who saw me betray my husband — I couldn’t live with that. I’ve been married 22 years. I never made a mistake. I have five children. May God reform them. Look, all of this is nonsense. How could I stain my own honor? My husband — for 22 years, not once did he slap me. Not once did he spit in my face. He treated me like a flower. I devoted myself to him completely. That’s the kind of woman I am. I get up at five in the morning for four or five kilos of okra. If I had my eye on anyone else, I wouldn’t get up at five for okra. I do it for my children’s allowance, for their future. To buy a dish for my house, a blanket for my children. Kill me if you must. But I have nothing to do with Salim. Hang me right here.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then why is Nevzat lying like this?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He’s lying. Look at his face.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Look at me.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Is he even human?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Look at me, look at me.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Is he human? Kill me, but don’t stain my honor. Don’t stain the Güran family.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He says there’s no such thing.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Absolutely, there isn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Enes didn’t come home, and Salim didn’t either.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear, I swear on the Qur’an, Salim and Nevzat never came to our house. This is my sin now. I have five children. Eren says, “Mom, why are you here? Why aren’t you coming home?” Poor kids — their psychology is completely ruined.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes. It’s always the children who suffer. What time did you go to the mosque? You said you knocked on the mosque door around evening prayer and the villagers came.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Around what time was that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We were home, the call to prayer was being recited.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Evening prayer. The evening adhan is between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m. on August 21.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Then when we went to the mosque to look for Narin, and when we came back home, all the gendarmerie had already arrived. That’s when these statements started. Şeyma Kaya said, “I saw Narin around 4 or 4:30, picking grape leaves.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, you said that.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I said that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I understand. I was just asking about the time because you mentioned a different hour before. Any questions? Judge? Anything to ask? Alright, we’ll continue later. Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any questions? Please, bring the microphone closer. Go ahead.​",

    "text": "Trial Prosecutor ​\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Around 13:30, after Narin left the house, you said you went to sleep, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : When Narin left, we went to sleep.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Alright. Not important. About that time. When did you wake up?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I don’t know what time it was.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Approximately?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I can’t remember the time at all. I was the first to get up and drink some water.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Two, three, four o’clock? You didn’t sleep until eight?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, no. When Hediye came, I don’t know what time it was. I swear, I didn’t know the time.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Okay. Was Muhammed also asleep?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : When Hediye came, Muhammed had already woken up.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Who opened the door for Hediye? She came twice.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : You can ask Hediye about that.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Who told you Hediye had arrived the first time?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Muhammed and Eren.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Muhammed, yes.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I think Muhammed or Eren opened the door for her.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Eren opened the door, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He opened it the first time. The second time, the door was open, and Hediye came inside.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : In your first statement to the prosecutor, you said Muhammed opened the door.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t know. You told me that. I didn’t know.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You said Muhammed opened the door.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I said that. I’m telling the truth. I said both of them got up and said, “Mom, Aunt Hediye brought my dress.” I said it was Muhammed, but later I realized Eren had opened it.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Alright.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Because I was lying down.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You said Muhammed also slept at noon. Yes? You both slept, right? Enes said earlier in his statement that he woke up at 16:00. He said, “I woke up at 16:00 and went outside.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : He said Muhammed was still asleep.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Enes was mistaken.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Pardon?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Enes spoke incorrectly. Because I was there.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Enes can’t be mistaken his whole life. He said the same thing to the prosecutor’s office.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The children don’t always remember things.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Wait a moment. Look, you said you went to bed at 1:30. Let’s go step by step.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : It’s now 4:00. Enes is going out. Hediye came — your sister-in-law Hediye. You woke up. Hediye was in the house.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Muhammed was asleep. Muhammed was still sleeping.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, Muhammed wasn’t sleeping.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : He wasn’t.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Eren is wrong. Enes is wrong.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So Enes is lying?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It’s not a lie. It’s wrong.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You would know whether someone was asleep, Yüksel.​\n\n\nDefense Counsel for Defendant Yüksel : You didn’t let me ask this question earlier.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes. He said it wrong. Maybe the child remembered it incorrectly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Good thing I didn’t. I did well not to.​\n\n\nDefense Counsel for Defendant Yüksel : But you let them ask now.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, and I said it was good that I did — for both of them. What else can I say?​\n\n\nDefense Counsel for Defendant Yüksel : You’re contradicting yourself.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s fine. I said it was good for both sides. What can I say?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Let me also say this. Maybe Enes doesn’t remember everything. He’s a child.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Alright then. Enes doesn’t remember everything — he’s a child. We’ll leave that aside. You said you stepped outside the door. Enes went out around 4:00. The exact time isn’t important. You were seeing Hediye off, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You said you went to the door. Where was Enes at that moment? Was he coming from the other side?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We stepped outside, like from the balcony. Enes came from outside.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Did Enes and Hediye see each other?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Hediye was there. Enes says he didn’t see her — I was surprised too.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Okay, Hediye says in her statement that you told her something.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, maybe he didn’t see her and then remembered later.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You said, “Son, why did you come back so early? There weren’t many people outside.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Did you say that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I think so, yes, I told him that, son.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Was Hediye with you when that conversation happened?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, she was.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Alright, so that’s the second contradiction for Enes. Enes again. Okay.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, Enes is mistaken. I was there, I saw it, he’s mistaken.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Okay. Enes called his brother Osman about the slippers. Was he near you when he made that call?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I was in the kitchen, but I could hear their voices.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You heard them. He asked for slippers, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I even told him, “Son, if you go all the way to Dörtyol and back, you’ll be late.”​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So you knew he asked for slippers?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I was in the kitchen, I heard him say his brother came.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Was there really such a shortage of slippers? Why is that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The child came home, his slippers were torn, so he asked his brother for a pair.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Still, you had a boy who worked as a waiter, coming home from town by minibus — and you’d have him go buy slippers from the town?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We just say what we need. Whatever we’re missing, we tell them.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Now, there was a course that ended around 4:00, right? Your daughter’s class lasted until 4:00. The time is 19:11 — according to our calculations, that’s evening prayer in that area. About three hours have passed, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So the moment you realized, you called out to Maşallah and started searching. But a girl who left class at 4:00 — three hours have passed — did she fall somewhere, get hurt, get hungry? Didn’t you think about her at all for those three hours?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She told me she was going to Fatma Hatice’s.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : But there’s no Fatma Hatice. You mean Maşallah’s daughters, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You could have at least called out, “Maşallah, is Narin there?” Three hours had passed.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She told me, “Mom, let me go,” so I let her.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Okay, so it didn’t cross your mind?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She was going to stay the night.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Alright. So you were calm for those three hours.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I had left her at that house. If I had gone to the hospital or somewhere else, Narin would have been there until evening.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Okay. Does your door have a bell?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, we don’t have a bell.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So how do people enter the house? Is there a wire or something?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, they pull a wire.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So your children and Narin enter by pulling the wire? They don’t have to knock?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : When Narin was inside, I told the lawyers too — she could push it open from the inside, but when she was outside, she couldn’t open it.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Alright, I understand. So that day, how did the children and Narin usually enter the house — by pushing?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, they knocked. If someone was inside, they opened it. I told the lawyers, but it was hard to open from the outside. It was stiff, so they struggled.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So it’s a pull-type latch? You pull it with a string? She wasn’t strong enough?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She wasn’t strong enough. When she was inside, she pushed it open.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I see.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She could open it, but it was hard to do from outside.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I understand. Alright. Thank you, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, Madam Judge. Right — you said the second time Hediye came, the door was open. Was the door open?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But you said the air conditioners were running in the house.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It wasn’t wide open. I think it was partly open. But then I saw Hediye arrive.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t open the door for Hediye?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then maybe she pulled the latch and opened it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I think it was already open. You can ask Hediye. I just saw her come inside.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. So you’re not sure. We’ll ask Hediye.​",

    "text": "Diyarbakır Bar Association ​\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir ​\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Ms. Yüksel, do you know Gazal Bahtiyar?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I know her.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : On the evening of the incident—​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : After 4:00 p.m., I’m asking about you.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I can recall that.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : When you realized that Narin was missing—​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : You told Muhammed. He went, said he couldn’t find her, and then you went out.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : You went to Maşallah’s, Hediye’s, and several other houses to look, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I called them on the phone.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : While you were walking toward Nevzat Bahtiyar’s house, did you run into Gazal?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No. Gazal came to us near the mosque.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Alright.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I was walking around Nevzat’s house.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Okay. When you encountered Gazal in the area near the mosque, did you have a conversation with her?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I was searching for Narin — shouting and crying while looking for her. She was behind me, trying to comfort me. She was saying, “Yüksel, calm down, you’ll find Narin. She’s probably resting somewhere. Pull yourself together.” She was saying things like that to me.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Did you say anything like, “Which one of you took my daughter”? Maybe to Gazal, maybe to someone else — do you remember saying that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, I don’t remember ever saying that. Gazal didn’t say Narin was gone either. When Narin disappeared, we were looking for her. We thought she might have been taken or something happened to her. Narin wasn’t around. We were searching for her. I don’t remember saying, “Whoever took my daughter, bring her back.”​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Did you say anything like, “At least let my daughter have a grave”?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Any shouting, any such words, anything at all?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Absolutely not, I didn’t say that.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : You didn’t.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : On the day of the incident, around 1 p.m., Narin told you she wanted to go to the Qur’an course, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : And at first, you objected, but later you gave her permission. When you gave permission, you knew her class would end around 4:00 and she would return home, correct?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, she said, “I’m going to Fatma Hatice’s. Mom, I’ll stay there until evening.”​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Until what time in the evening?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Normally the kids stay out until 6 or 7. We have to drag them home from the street. The village kids play there, and we bring them back. I knew she wouldn’t be home until dinner.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : After Narin left the house — around 1:30 in the afternoon.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Until around 4:00 or even 4:30 in the evening — were you at home the entire time, or did you go out?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We didn’t go anywhere.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : You didn’t go anywhere at all.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, I swear. The children maybe, yes — Enes went out, Muhammed went out. But I didn’t go anywhere.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Did you see Salim or anyone else around the house?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : You didn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Are you recording? The lady with glasses — are you an attorney? You? When phones are lifted up like that, it draws attention. You’re not recording, right? You’re an attorney? Yes? You? You’re not recording, right? Friends, please, I’m asking — no video recording. Look, video recordings put us in a difficult position. I understand, making videos here, posting them is tempting. I don’t use Twitter, but it would probably get retweets. It’s nice for you, but it’s disrespectful to the court, and under the Turkish Penal Code, it’s a crime. Understand? So please, let’s avoid any accusations of that kind, alright? Because when you hold the phone like that, I perceive it as recording. You’re right to want to record, and I’ll be careful too, but I’m asking you to be careful. Go ahead, counsel.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : During the day or evening — could be before or after Narin disappeared — did you ever see Salim?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear I didn’t see him. Not at all. I only said that maybe when I lowered the switch, someone saw him at Hüseyin Güran’s door. Maybe for a second. I swear I didn’t see him myself.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : During the day, when you were home, was your phone always with you?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The phone was with the children.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : When you left the house later that evening, did you take the phone with you?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Me?​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Yes.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, never. When the children were home, I didn’t use the phone. Because when they were home and playing with it, wherever I went I would tell them, “Son, look, I’m here,” and they would call me. I absolutely didn’t take the phone with me.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Can you tell me the names of Salim’s children?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Of course. Dilek, Gamze, İlayda, Devran, Gülsüm, Miran.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : On the day Narin went missing, did you see any of those children?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, I didn’t see them at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : Not in front of the house, in the barn, the yard, the garden, the street, or in front of Salim’s house?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, in the late afternoon, around five, his wife, his kids, his sister — they were all at the door. The children were all outside after five. But I swear, I didn’t see any of them. I didn’t even go around the house.​\n\n\nLaw. Mehdi Özdemir : After the incident, did you wash the carpets or floors inside the house?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Absolutely not. In the morning, I sent Enes’s clothes to Hediye’s house.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren ​\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I have a question for a mother. I’ll preface it with a few things.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, as long as you don’t make a comment.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I won’t comment. My statement will include some questions, but before that — ever since the Narin case began — I want to say this because I’ll be asking a mother a question. Before I question a mother, I must acknowledge the weight of the Diyarbakır Bar Association’s institutional identity. I won’t interrogate you. I’ll only ask a few questions. Technically, it’s an interrogation, but I won’t treat it like one. And I’ll tell you why. You see this crowd here today, don’t you? So many people have come. Have you ever seen a trial or a court hearing before?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Never in my life. I’ve never even seen a police station, let alone something like this.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course she hasn’t — how could she?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : We have, Your Honor, that’s why I’m explaining. Yes, you have lawyers too, and we all respect the right to defense. The right to defense is sacred. Apart from your lawyers, nearly fifty bar presidents from all over Turkey are here, though not all their names were recorded in the minutes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I wrote it down later, during the break.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Around fifty bar presidents are here. Representatives from all organizations in Turkey working on women’s and children’s rights are here. Members of Parliament are here.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Thank you.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : We’re all here. And let me say something very special — truly special. You know why we’re all here? We’re all here for Narin.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We’re all here for Narin.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : None of us are here to use this case for personal gain, as some have claimed. Everyone here is a lawyer who has already proven their integrity. Anyone who tries to benefit from Narin’s case — in any way, in this courtroom — in my view, is in the same category as the one who killed Narin.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : God will not let Narin’s right go unanswered.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You’ll see where I’m going with this.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He won’t let it go.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : We all wanted to take part in this case. Everyone did. To do something for Narin. To stand beside the prosecutor and uncover the truth — to ensure those who killed her are punished. You — your daughter died. Your second daughter was also killed. Killed. Killed. Both of your daughters were killed.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : They killed me too.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : May God protect your children for you.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : They killed me too.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m speaking to your conscience. That’s why I’m saying all this. I’ll appeal to your conscience. Do you see this file?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I see it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you see these papers? The writing on them?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I see them.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you know who prepared this file? I’ve been involved since Narin’s autopsy. I have three daughters. These labels — my daughters made them at home for Narin, to contribute to her case. All this handwriting — it’s theirs. So that Narin’s killer would be found. So we could do our part. In Turkey, no child has ever been embraced like this before. Maybe that was our mistake — that we didn’t show this care earlier, and that’s why we lost Narin. If we had, maybe she’d still be alive today.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Counsel, let’s move on to the question now.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The question is tied to what I’m saying. I’m speaking to her feelings and her conscience. The solution to this case lies in a mother’s conscience. I’ll ask her as a mother — as the defendant.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We already discussed last session how sensitive the Diyarbakır Bar Association is to issues like torture.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Your Honor, everyone knows the Diyarbakır Bar well. That’s not a problem. I’ll ask her this. I said I wouldn’t interrogate her, right? On August 25th, you were called in as a complainant. Do you know what a complainant is? It means you should be standing where I am right now — you should be here as the mother.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That’s what “complainant” means. You were called to the station on the 25th and gave your statement. They asked you what happened to your daughter — to help find her. I once said something on television, just once, about this case. I said, “In murder cases, the family helps us. The mother tells us something. The father, the brother, the uncle, the villagers — they all tell us something. That’s how we solve it.” Now they came to you and asked, “There’s a scarf,” and you said it was on the stairs.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : What’s that?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let me ask, Ms. Yüksel. You said to the imam, “The day after Narin died, I found a purple scarf on the stairs.” The imam asked, “Did Narin wear this scarf when she came to the Qur’an course at the mosque?”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Let me explain.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m reminding you of the imam so you remember what he told you.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He said yes, she had a scarf like that on her head.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No. That scarf—​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No, the imam’s statement — the one based on what you said. I can remind you. Where is that scarf now?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He came to me on the second day.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Where is that scarf now?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : That wasn’t the scarf.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What do you mean?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The imam said it looked like it, but he wasn’t sure.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let me read it then.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No — if he had said, “That’s the one,” I would have handed it to the gendarmerie. It was at home.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you’re saying he said it looked similar. Let me ask — where is that scarf you showed the imam?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It was at home.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Where is it now? Still at home, I assume?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Is it still there?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Where did you find it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : You know. But that scarf was there at noon, he said. Because I washed that balcony in the evening.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Of course — I’m asking where exactly you found it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let me tell it first. The imam came to us. There were many people on the balcony. He called me over and said, “Yüksel, I was teaching at the mosque. I looked up and saw Narin and the children watching us through the window. I told them, ‘This isn’t a cinema. If you want to learn, come inside and take lessons.’ Then I saw Narin come in. She was wearing a skirt — a purple skirt — and had a purple shawl. I even said, ‘Mina, is she your sister?’ and she said, ‘No, she’s my cousin, Uncle Arif’s daughter.’ I said, ‘Oh, I didn’t know she was Arif’s daughter. Her eyes look like Osman’s,’” the imam told me. Then he said, “When the class ended, she took off her skirt and her shawl. Her hair was uncovered. She removed the purple skirt.” I said, “Yes, teacher, she had a purple skirt, that’s correct.” Muhammed said when she left the house, she had a lunch bag. It was pink. He told that to the gendarmerie. I told the teacher, “I washed that balcony in the evening; there was nothing there.” That night I was crying. The women were with me there. I didn’t even own a purple shawl back then. If there was some confusion, I didn’t know. I told them that when I sat with the women that night, I saw that shawl among the skewers. I said, ‘This is it, teacher.’”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : When you say “skewers,” what do you mean?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The balcony. Outside. Yes, outside.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You saw it there. And it belonged to you, right? To your house?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It was mine.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The one you showed?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He looked at it and said, “I’m not sure, but it looks like it.” That’s what I said in my statement too. If he had said, “Yes, that’s the shawl,” I would’ve handed it to the gendarmerie immediately. It was on our balcony.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : And that shawl is still at home?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, it’s still at home. I haven’t been home for two months, but I believe it’s there. It should be at home.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : As I said, this isn’t an interrogation — I’m just continuing from the statements. Hediye came to your house.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : She came around three, turned the valve off and on, and went back to her house.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : She dropped off the clothes at your place, went home, saw something had overflowed, and came back at 15:45, she says. When she came back, what was Muhammed doing?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Muhammed — I think Muhammed was home.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Was he sleeping?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, he couldn’t have been asleep.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You were all in the same room — Muhammed, Hediye, everyone. Did Muhammed see Hediye, in your opinion?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I think Muhammed was there when Hediye came, but at that moment, I wasn’t home. As far as I know, though, he was home.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Muhammed was home. He didn’t say he wasn’t home. So did he see her?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : When Hediye came, I told her, “The kids said, Aunt Hediye came, dropped off the clothes, and left.” I said, “Son, why didn’t you wake me up?” He said, “Mom, she didn’t leave yet.” I was just saying that when, a minute or two later, I saw Hediye there. Hediye came to us. So when she came, I said the same thing to her. And Muhammed was there.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You’ve said all this before. I just want to confirm — Muhammed was home and saw Hediye with you?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear, I think Muhammed was home. He saw her. Yes, I’m saying he was home. I can’t remember clearly. Maybe he told me later — I don’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You say “I think.” So you’re not sure, right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did Muhammed leave the house with Enes?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, Enes was still sleeping.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But later they left — Enes got up. Enes woke up.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Enes is mistaken.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Enes says, “I woke up, saw Hediye, asked how she was, then left the house.” When he left, did Muhammed go out after him?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Muhammed had gone out earlier.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Muhammed went out earlier.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I said here — Enes was mistaken. When Enes woke up, Muhammed wasn’t there. He wasn’t asleep. Enes woke up groggy. I’m telling you, Enes was wrong. When Enes woke up, Muhammed wasn’t sleeping.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did Muhammed and Enes return home together?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : In the evening?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Enes came once more. When he went up the hill and came back down, he returned home. Up to the hill — with friends.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : That’s not what I’m asking.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You heard him too. Enes said, “The first time I went out, I went to Tahir Market to buy a drink. Then, instead of getting into the car, I walked home to avoid helping Süheyla.” So, was Muhammed with him when he came back?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, Muhammed wasn’t with him.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He wasn’t.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I can’t recall clearly. By then he had started working. Muhammed had come but hadn’t gone out. You’re still talking with Hediye — Hediye was still home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ms. Yüksel, Ms. Yüksel — microphone, please.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Hediye was still home.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : When Enes came, Muhammed — when Enes came home, Muhammed or Hediye had just left. The second time.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But they saw each other.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : When Enes came inside, Hediye was still at the door.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m appealing to your conscience one last time. That day, did Hediye come to your house at all?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear she came twice.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : No need to swear.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She came once — I was asleep. Then the second time.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So Hediye did come to your house that day.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, she stayed with us for about two hours in total.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Before three o’clock, did Hediye ever tell you where she had been? You know, you chatted — you sent the clothes around 10 a.m. to be washed.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, she didn’t mention that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Not during your conversation either?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, she didn’t say anything about that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let me ask something. You know Abdurrahman — Hediye’s son.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He’s an adult, grown up.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He said when he woke up at 1 p.m., Hediye wasn’t home. The last time he saw her was around 5 p.m.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I don’t know about that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So Hediye never talked to you about where she had been until then?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She said, “Yüksel, I brought your clothes. You were sleeping. I went to run the water pump. After I filled the tank, I turned it off. I thought, Yüksel must be awake now, I’ll go to her.” She didn’t mention anything else.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Alright, one last thing that’s been confusing me — and the court panel too. Can you explain the matter about the blood? Not the blood from the ambulance — I mean the turkey blood.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t know anything about that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The turkey, the turkey.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, the turkey. I said before — I woke up at 5 a.m.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did that happen the day before?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It was that same night.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : But in some places, you said it was the day before. I’m asking about the blood found on the stairs. Because let me explain — Your Honor, this is about evidence — a blood sample was found on the stairs of your annex.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : You mean that one — that was Tahir Kaya’s blood. I didn’t know about it at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : There was human blood found. But because so much time had passed, the DNA sample was too small to identify who it belonged to. Still, it was confirmed to be human blood, taken from the stairs near your annex. That’s why I’m asking. Can you explain the issue with the turkey and the dog — why did you mention them in your statements? Why are we talking about turkey blood? I’m trying to understand.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It wasn’t inside. In the morning — the turkey blood wasn’t inside. I was picking okra at 5 a.m. I woke up, checked how many rows were left, and saw a dead, torn-up turkey in front of me. I said to myself, “It must have been the dog,” because our turkeys stay outside at night. I said, “The dog must have eaten the turkey during the night.” When we came back in the evening, we had put the turkey in the barn. As for the blood in the house, I later heard it was Tahir Kaya’s — he had a nosebleed outside and got blood on himself. When he saw the blood, he went inside and asked for a tissue. That’s what I heard from people. It was that day, maybe the second or third day — I didn’t remember at the time. Then I heard about it later. There were many kids outside that day — they said his nose was bleeding.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : I’m not talking about the blood on the rocks. You’re talking about that. Was the blood on the stones next to the barn Tahir’s blood?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, it was his blood.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Who said that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The children were saying it. I heard it later.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The children said that. There was also a statement by the governor about that blood. Who said it belonged to Tahir?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : There were many kids there. I heard it later.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let me tell you something — that blood, the human blood, couldn’t be matched to anyone because of how much time had passed. But it was human. I’m asking because the blood seen on the fourth day wasn’t fresh. So the blood that was said to be Tahir’s — that wasn’t the same one. A blood sample was found on the stairs.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I heard about that later too. Yes, I heard later they said it was Tahir’s blood.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you think the one on the stairs was also Tahir’s?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Look, I’ll tell you — later, some gendarmerie came. They said they were taking blood samples. I asked, “What happened? What blood are they talking about?” The children said, “Tahir Kaya’s nose bled, and he got blood on the stones. Then he touched it with his hand, went inside, and asked for a tissue.” I swear I had no idea about that blood. I didn’t even know there was blood there. I only heard about it later.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Alright.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Any other questions, Mr. Nahit?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Thank you, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you. Any further questions from the Diyarbakır Bar Association? If not, we’ll close after that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Do you have internet on your phone?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : If there’s a line, yes, but the kids usually don’t let me use it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So your phone does have an internet line?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I think so — yes, it does.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So you have WhatsApp.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I have WhatsApp.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Right, the photo of the phone and the slippers came. There was some inconsistency there, but yes, yes, I saw it. It’s confirmed. I saw it myself. But the slipper photo — we didn’t dwell on it much. We didn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : One last question. Among your sisters, which one loved Narin the most?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes. Everyone loved her.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Who loved her the most, for example? Among your sisters?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : My sisters — truly, everyone loved Narin. Because she was my only daughter, my whole family loved her.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Can we say Yasemin loved her the most?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yasemin loved her too. Everyone was very protective of Narin. Because I had only one daughter — I had lost my first one, who was disabled — so everyone loved this one even more.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık ​\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : This was asked earlier, but I’d like to clarify. Was the purple headscarf yours?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : That purple headscarf wasn’t mine.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Not yours? The imam said Narin came wearing a purple scarf. Where did you see that scarf? On the stairs? At the door?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : You know the balcony railing? I didn’t see it at first. I said, “Teacher, I saw this purple shawl here that night. This is it, or maybe it isn’t.” He looked and said, “I’m not entirely sure.”​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Alright.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : That’s what he told me. If he had said, “Yes, Yüksel, this is the purple shawl,” I would’ve immediately given it to the gendarmerie. The imam said, “It looks like that shawl.”​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : The imam told you it looked like the scarf Narin wore on her head?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It looked similar, yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : And that scarf was yours.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, it was mine.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : You have no other daughter who would wear a scarf, and you didn’t place it outside yourself. So didn’t you wonder how that scarf ended up outside?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Look, I had washed the balcony — there was nothing there. When I washed it, it was clean. That night, when everything happened, someone must have laid something out there — maybe a cushion or pillow for sitting. People were coming and sitting around. We were out searching for Narin. Later that night, when I sat down with the women, I noticed that purple scarf. At the time, I didn’t think — whether Narin had taken it or someone else had. The imam said she had a purple scarf on her head. I immediately went and brought the purple scarf and said, “Teacher, this is it.” He looked and said, “I’m not completely sure.” If he had said, “Yes, Yüksel, this is the one,” I would’ve given it to the gendarmerie immediately.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Alright, Ms. Yüksel. It’s normal that the imam couldn’t identify it for sure. But this scarf belonged to you, it was inside your home, and yet somehow it ended up outside without you touching it. Didn’t it occur to you that Narin might have taken it off, and why didn’t you inform the gendarmerie? After all, only two women in the house could have worn it — you or Narin.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I did say it. I’ve given thousands of statements. I said if the imam had confirmed it was purple, I would’ve told them someone must have brought this shawl there that night.​\n\n\nLaw. Asya Cemre Işık : Let me ask differently. The imam said it resembled Narin’s, and you didn’t put it outside. Didn’t you think Narin might have taken it off? Why didn’t you report it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The imam said she had a purple skirt and a purple shawl. I said, “Teacher, if there was a purple shawl, it wasn’t this one. I saw this one here at night.” He said, “I’m not sure.” If he had said, “Yes, this was it,” I would’ve handed it to the gendarmerie immediately. Later we searched the house over and over — I’ve given thousands of statements. We never saw that lunch bag or the purple skirt again. I’ve said this many times. Yes, no further questions.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Counsel for Arif Güran, do you have any questions? No.​",

    "section": "Ministry of Family and Social Services ​",
    "text": "Ministry of Family and Social Services ​\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun ​\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : You have a statement dated August 25. In it, you said that around the time of the evening call to prayer, you asked Muhammed, “Where’s Narin?” and he said, “Mom, Narin’s not here.” Then you called Maşallah Güran over, and she said, “Around 5 o’clock, Narin was at our house.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The statements later—​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Let me finish. Then you went to the mosque, and İsa Kaya came to you and said, “Sister, I saw Narin around 6 o’clock in front of the mosque.” But by that time, Narin had already been killed and left by the riverbank. As a mother, didn’t you question these people? Why did they say such things to you?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : That evening İbrahim Güran and the gendarmerie didn’t let me go anywhere. Regarding those statements — he said, “Aunt Yüksel, Şeyma said she saw her around 4:00–4:30.”​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : 4:30, but Maşallah said she was at your house at 5.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : That 5 was Maşallah’s time. Şeyma — Şeyma Kaya. And İsa Kaya told me himself later.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : He said he saw her at 6.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Then Maşallah Güran said, “I was ironing between 5:00 and 5:30. I was on the phone when someone knocked. I asked, ‘Who is it?’ She said Narin asked the girls something. I told her she must have gone to her grandmother’s.” Then Commander Hülya told me at the station, “Yüksel, Maide Kaya appears on camera looking up toward the hill.” I asked Maide, “Who were you talking to?” She said, “I was talking to Narin. I told her, ‘Narin, come down, let’s play.’ Narin said, ‘Maide, I’m tired, I’m sleepy, I’m hungry. I’m going home.’” Where is Narin? Narin came to you at 7. Enes was here. Where is Narin? They were pressing me. Then Commander Hülya came to our house, called me out, went west toward the slope — my sister-in-law’s son was there. She told him, “Go up to the house.” She said, “Look, Yüksel — it doesn’t add up. Narin was here at 7, Enes was here. Where is Narin?” They kept accusing me. I said, “Commander, at 7 there were so many people by Hüseyin Güran’s house — Süheyla was filling hay by the school, Enes Güran and his friends were there, many women, men, children behind him, the headman’s family was all outside. Where could Narin have gone at 7?” They kept interrogating me. The children weren’t lying.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : So in summary, Maşallah Güran said she saw her at 5, and İsa Kaya said 6?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Maşallah told the gendarmerie. İbrahim Güran told me. The gendarmerie told me too.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : You said, “I called her over. She came to our house around 5.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Maşallah later came and told us. She had already given her statement first, then came to us.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : But by that time Narin was already dead. Didn’t you question them about that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I did. At first the gendarmerie blamed us. “It happened at 7, it happened at 7. Where’s Narin?” Then they said it happened in the barn.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : So you didn’t ask these people why they lied?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t go anywhere. I wasn’t in any condition. I told Maşallah, “I have proof. I was on the phone — the record is there.” I didn’t see the others at all. Then they said, “It happened in the barn, in the barn.” They kept blaming us. When new things came out, they said, “It happened inside the house, inside the house.” Wherever something happens, they throw it on us — me, my child. I swear we never saw Narin. I swear I wouldn’t trade even her fingernail for the world.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you. Any questions?​\n\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz ​\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : After Narin disappeared, when did you inform your husband? When did you tell Arif Güran?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t. Because I knew he was on the road, coming home. If I had said, “Narin’s missing,” he would have lost his mind. I didn’t call him. Everyone was comforting me — “Maybe she fell somewhere, maybe she’s nearby.” I didn’t call him. Later he called me. I don’t know who told him, but I heard it was Cevat Kaya who told Arif, “You’ve found Narin.” That’s how I heard it.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : And both Arif Güran and Salim Güran said they had no conflict or enmity with Nevzat. Did you ever notice any hostility or tension with Nevzat?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Never. Not at all — none.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Then why would he kill your daughter? You’re also saying he did it. Enes, your son, says the same thing.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I’m not saying that. I’m not accusing anyone, Counselor.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : But why would he kill her, Ms. Yüksel? Why would Nevzat do such a thing? The uncle says their relations were good, they were family friends. The father says there was no hostility — that’s their own statement, not mine. Why would something like this happen?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : A few days before the incident, my daughter came home holding twenty million lira. She said, “Mom, look, I have money.” I said, “Where did you get that money, my girl?” She said, “Brother Nevzat gave it to me.” Later, I mentioned this to the judge, but not to the prosecutor. When Nevzat was arrested and put into custody, that’s when it came to my mind. I said, “My daughter, shame on him — why would he give you money?” He had also given money to Süheyla. Then I didn’t think about it again. Now he comes out and says, “She was here, she was there.” I said before too — they claimed there was DNA in Salim’s car. They said he gave her something by the roadside. As a mother, my heart and mind were overwhelmed — I thought, “Oh God, this man has lost his mind and killed my daughter.” Later his statements kept changing — then he said it happened inside the house. I said, “He’s lying.” If he had said it happened on the road, the DNA would’ve shown up in his car. He would’ve said, “I threatened her, gave her something on the road.” Maybe, for a moment, my mother’s heart believed it — maybe he did it. But then I swore, that dishonorable man never set foot in our home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, alright.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : My last question, Your Honor. Narin’s aunt, Yasemin Gül — when Narin’s body was recovered, there was an argument among the women in the family. She even turned to you during it.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I was in shock. The ambulance had arrived. Commander Hülya said, “My condolences.” I already knew Narin was gone. I wasn’t myself — I fainted. I don’t remember anything. When I came to, I was inside the ambulance. I said, “Commander, let me go — I want to see my children.” I could hear voices outside. I couldn’t see the women. Through the back doors of the ambulance, I saw the men and the gendarmerie. I said, “Let me out.” The commander didn’t let me.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : She said, “If you had told the truth, this wouldn’t have happened,” right? The others said something like that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I don’t know. I don’t know who was arguing.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : But you never talked to your sister about it afterward?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I really don’t know. Even the judge asked me. He said, “Your sister Maşallah knew about the fight.” I said, “I swear I don’t know.” I was in detention for five days. I heard Melike and Maşallah mentioning my sister’s name, but I don’t know what happened in the argument.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : So you never talked about that fight afterward?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No. I didn’t ask, and they didn’t ask me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ms. Yüksel, you said you saw the money.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you tell your husband or children — Enes said he didn’t know about it. Did you tell anyone that Nevzat gave her money?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, I didn’t. I didn’t know myself. It seemed normal.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you weren’t suspicious?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It seemed normal — maybe he gave it to Narin too, just casually.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Had he ever done that before?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You don’t know.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She told me about it that day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Any questions from the defense? Please, go ahead. We’ll take you next.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Salim Güran ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Ms. Yüksel, had Narin ever been in Salim’s car before?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, on July 14.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : For what reason?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : It was for Berat’s engagement. Arif wasn’t home, and we didn’t have a car or seats available. Narin and Eren rode in that car. Salim had a car then, and Devran was driving. Hediye and the children also went in that car. Muhammed and I went in Memduh Güran’s car. We went and returned like that.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So Narin was in Salim’s car, correct?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, she rode in that car.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Before the incident, did you ever ride with Narin in your own car?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : In our car?​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : In Arif’s car?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did Arif take you anywhere a day or two before the incident? Did Narin ride in that car?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, the day before we went to Diyarbakır as guests for dinner. Wherever we went, we took our car.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did Nevzat ever come to your house? I mean, had he ever entered your home before the incident day? I don’t mean that day specifically — I mean in general. Did he ever visit as a guest?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I never saw Nevzat at our house. A few months before, he had the wells dug, so he was always around the area. When the well work ended, he’d still come around — we’d sit on the hill. But before that, I hadn’t seen him.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So Nevzat never came into your home?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, never. I don’t remember that.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did Gazal Bahtiyar ever come over as a guest?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Gazal did come. God curse her — they didn’t have water, so she came every day to fetch water from us. She came to us — that was our kindness, Counselor. We were helping her because she had no water. But that kindness, Nevzat turned against us.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But look, Ms. Yüksel — there’s no serious hostility here. I’ve reviewed hundreds, maybe thousands of murder cases. When there’s hostility, it’s usually clear. You’re saying there was none — in fact, you say you were kind, gave them water. So if there was no hostility, and you were on good terms — could it be that Nevzat was doing something wrong? We asked before whether you or Enes had any sexual relations with him. Forgive me for asking — it’s been reported in the news and caused controversy — but could it be that Nevzat was involved sexually with one of the three of you, and Narin saw it, and that’s why he killed her?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I’ll just say this — as my lawyers said too — Nevzat’s wife, even the commander told me, “Nevzat came to your house,” meaning Gazal. I said, “No, she doesn’t come to us.” He said, “She came to you first.” I said, “Yes, that’s true. Gazal came to us.” Maybe a month before, I don’t know exactly. I saw Gazal at the door — she was going toward Belkıs’s place. They were cousins. It was around the Karakoç incident. I said, “Gazal, come inside.” She came to us.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Could we quiet down the background noise a bit?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Gazal came to us. I went to Belkıs’s house — I was coming from Yeni Salihagil. I asked how things were. We talked for a bit. Then I went back to Gazal. I said, “Gazal, Hatiye Zeyno doesn’t talk to us anymore. I greet her — she doesn’t reply. Why?” Gazal laughed and said, “Don’t mind her.” I said, “I really don’t know.” I thought it was because of the car. Hatiye Zeyno wasn’t speaking to us because of that car issue. Gazal said, “Forget her.” I said, “Honestly, Gazal, I didn’t know anything about this.” One day Arif said he was going to the headman’s house. I told Gazal. I said, “No, Nevzat bought a car — it turned out stolen. We’re going there to talk about it.” Arif came back and said, “We’re having a meeting. Neither of us nor anyone else will handle it. Cevat Kaya will come. Rukedin Kaya brought him. We’ll do what they suggest.” Then Gazal said, “Yüksel, neither Cevat Kaya nor Rukedin Kaya — they all took Salim’s side. They put the blame for the money on Nevzat.” I said, “I don’t know about any of that.” She said, “Ferhat refused to pay that money. He said, ‘Even if I kill myself or someone else, I won’t pay it.’” İbrahim, his son, said, “That’s shameful. If Salim doesn’t pay and Arif doesn’t pay, where will it come from? It’s not a small amount.” Then I saw Arif and Nevzat talking up on the hill. I went over and said, “Welcome, Nevzat.” They were talking about the money. Arif said, “I’ll give it to the lawyer. Once the lawyer settles it, we’ll pay you back.” Nevzat said, “Fine.” I said, “That’s good. We’ve been neighbors for years — it’s not a huge amount. Just settle it.” Our children were all friends. Then I said, “Congrats on your new house.” He talked with my husband and left. I never thought about that car again. I never told my husband, my kids, or anyone about what Ferhat said. They made up things, but we had nothing to do with it. If we had, we would’ve said so. None of this ever crossed our minds.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. On the day of the incident, did you hear any rumors that Nevzat had sexual relations with someone? Any gossip in the village?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : From whom?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Well, since there were claims about you and Salim — perhaps Nevzat had an affair with someone else, and Narin saw it, and he killed her because of that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Who said that? May God curse them. I swear it’s a lie.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you ever hear that Nevzat had a sexual relationship with someone?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No. I never heard that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I’m just asking. Don’t curse me. Hey, why are you cursing me?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I don’t know anything about that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, there’s nothing like that? You never heard such a thing?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You started cursing right away.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I’m so angry right now, that’s why. Alright, alright — let me say it piece by piece. Look, I’m saying it here too: he has no fear of God. I leave his children to God as well.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, look — you said, “I’ll tear him apart piece by piece,” didn’t you? Nevzat also said, “If I had done it, they would have torn me apart.” That’s what reminded me of it. Okay, fine. I’m not saying you meant that. Arif would tear him apart too. Maybe Enes, maybe even Eren — I’ve said it before. But with such a risk of being torn apart, Nevzat supposedly took the body, hid it, and stayed in the village for 19, 20, maybe 21 days — the number doesn’t matter — right there in front of everyone. Is that correct?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We didn’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But surely you would have heard at some point. When Nevzat learned about it — the whole country was searching — if he was the man who killed her, the man who planned it, wouldn’t he have thought, “If this comes out, this family will kill me,” and fled with his whole family?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : If he had that sense, he wouldn’t have done it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Wouldn’t have done what?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : His part in the crime — he wouldn’t have done it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But he’s not saying “I did it.” He says, “They killed her and gave her to me. I took the body, buried it, and lay down there.” He’s not saying he killed her.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : That’s what we’re saying. We wouldn’t do what he did.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, but listen — Nevzat isn’t saying “I did it.” He says, “They gave me the body. I took it, buried it.” He says that’s why he didn’t flee — because he didn’t do it. How did you know he was lying?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Everyone knows he’s lying.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why? How does everyone know he’s lying?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Because he never came to our house. I’m saying it right here — if it had been somewhere else…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He didn’t come to your house?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I swear, he didn’t. Neither of them did.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : The vehicle Salim was using recently — whose car was it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He had one. After his accident, for a few days I saw Metin Kaya’s car parked at his door. I even said, “Maybe he bought a new car.” The children said, “No, it’s Metin Kaya’s car, his brother-in-law’s.” Later, when Metin Kaya’s car disappeared, he started using his brother’s car.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : What’s his brother’s name?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Fuat.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Fuat. Did you see that car around Salim’s house that day — in front of his door, nearby, or anywhere else?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, absolutely not that day.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So you didn’t see it parked or moving near his house?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, I swear that day I only saw it once, near Hüseyin Güran’s door. I didn’t see him or his children at all. I went by their door until evening and saw only the children.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Which of Salim’s children did Narin play with the most?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She played with İlayda and Yusuf. Mostly with İlayda. My children didn’t play much with others. She’d go to Fatma Hatice’s house. I often sent the little ones there. Or she went to Hediye Güran’s house.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did children ever play in front of Salim’s house?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : If they were there, they might have, but Narin didn’t play with them much. Whenever I went somewhere, she’d either go to Hediye’s house or to Hüseyin Güran’s. She played with their children.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Now you’re saying whoever is guilty should be revealed.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, that’s what I want. I want the killer.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Nevzat is slandering you?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : He says he saw you crying. Couldn’t he have made the same false claim about Salim?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So, the man who said he saw you crying — couldn’t he also say Salim did it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I don’t know. I leave it to God.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : But you say he slandered you.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Of course.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Yet he’s telling the same story.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He’s confessing falsely about me.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : He names both Salim and you.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, he accuses both of us — but it’s not true. I swear it’s not true.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : So he’s lying about you?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : He’s falsely confessing about me.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Any other questions, Counselor?​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : No, Your Honor. Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ms. Yüksel, you may sit down. Thank you.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : But I want the killer found.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We all do.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I want Narin’s killer. Bring me Narin’s killer.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment, please. We have another question. Let me ask again. We know you were at home. We also know Narin was last seen on the school’s camera at 15:11. There’s a 4-minute margin of error, but around 15:11. The distance between the school and your house is roughly 5 minutes. Could Narin have seen something she shouldn’t have? Like I said before—perhaps she saw Nevzat with someone else. I’m just wondering. Look, you said you talked with Gazal about the car, that you’d seen another car parked near their door. In a village, this kind of thing is always noticed. There’s plenty of free time—people pay attention to who visits whom. We grew up in villages too. Right?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When a car with a foreign plate enters the village, everyone immediately asks who it is and why they came. Right? Is that true?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : If I saw it, I would have told you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, people gossip among themselves. Did you hear any gossip in the village during that 4- or 5-minute period?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t. So could Narin have seen something before she was killed—something involving Nevzat or Salim?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t see anything. If I had, I swear I would’ve shouted it from the start.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You’re saying you didn’t see, but I’m asking if you heard any gossip.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No gossip, nothing seen or heard.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, thank you. Please take your seat. Wait, one more question.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The sound isn’t clear—please speak up. Counselor, can you hear me?​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : There were many questions about the headscarf. When you asked the imam about it, was it to confirm whether Narin came home that day? To verify if she made it back home? Or was it for another reason? The authorities also mentioned this.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let’s ask then—why did you ask the imam about the headscarf?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : The imam said she had a purple skirt and a purple headscarf. When he said that, I said, “Let me check, teacher, this scarf is mine. I saw it here that night when the women were sitting.” I asked, “Could this be it or not?” He said, “Honestly, I’m not sure—it might not be.” That’s why I asked.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where’s the purple skirt?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I don’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did she wear the purple skirt that day?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : That’s what the imam said.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did she leave the house wearing it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : We searched, but didn’t see the purple skirt.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because it wasn’t on the body, right?​",

Alright, I must have missed that.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : I’m asking because—did you think someone brought it there, or that Narin came home, left it, and went somewhere else?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No. Because I had washed that balcony. Later the women came and spread things out—brought cushions and pillows. They sat me down among the railings while I was crying. That’s when I noticed it. The next morning the imam came and said the skirt was purple, the scarf was purple. I immediately brought the scarf and said, “Teacher, is this the one?” He said, “Honestly, I’m not entirely sure.” He said, “You brought it.” That same night I had seen that purple scarf among the railings. He said, “I’m not sure.”​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : You don’t know who placed it there or brought it?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : What would you have concluded if the imam had said, “Yes, that’s the same purple scarf”?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I would have understood that someone had brought it there that night, and I would have immediately handed it to the gendarmerie.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : You would have said someone left it there at night?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I would have said, “Someone brought this purple scarf here at night. It’s mine.” But I had already washed the balcony—there was nothing there before. When the women came later, I saw it. I would have given it to the gendarmerie right away.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright, thank you. Go ahead.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Yüksel Güran ​\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu ​\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Your Honor, the indictment claims that some phone call or message records were deleted. Did you ever delete any calls or messages?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No? Absolutely no?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I don’t even know how to delete. I don’t normally use WhatsApp much.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : The indictment also says your phone was turned off during the critical hours, around 15:30. Did that happen?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : No, nobody turned it off. The children had it in their hands.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You were asleep at the time, I see. Now, Maide Kaya, Maşallah, and Birsen gave times—Maide’s was a little later.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, 07:30—twenty minutes to seven, that’s what they told us.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Twenty to seven, right. The indictment claims the Güran family influenced these witnesses.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, that’s what they said to us.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : That’s the allegation. After the gendarmerie interviewed these witnesses, you gave an interview on Didem Aslan Yılmaz’s TV program Vazgeçme.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : In that interview, you said loudly, “Narin didn’t go there; she either went up the hill or went around from there.” Can you explain why you said that? Let me remind you: you also said, “My daughter would never get into a stranger’s car.”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I said that.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : And you said, “If someone familiar called my daughter, then she’d go.” Correct?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Yes, I said that too.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When you heard Maşallah’s and Birsen’s statements about those times, what did you think? Did Narin appear around that time?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : They told us Maşallah said 5, Mahide said twenty to 7, İsa said 6, Şeyma said 4:30. We said, “Then where is Narin?” The gendarmerie blamed us completely. They said Narin disappeared at 7, Narin came home at 7, you and Enes were home. They put all the blame on us. These children weren’t lying. Then a gendarmerie team came every day with their equipment, checking around the barn. Every day. They said the incident happened at 3. They accused us of forcing witnesses to lie, of influencing them. Then when Nevzat appeared, they said Narin left the house—again putting the blame on us. “She left the house, where did she go?” they said, “It was you.” First they said 7, then changed it to 3. They said, “You forced these witnesses.” Later, when Nevzat said he took her from inside the house, again they blamed us—“You were there, Enes was there, or maybe Salim.” They threw everything back on us. Wherever it happened, they pinned it on our necks. Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Alright, thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you.​",

    "text": "Presiding Judge ​\n\nPresiding Judge : Ms. Gazal, please. Inform the lawyers. Notify them. Gazal is here. Salim is here. Enes is here. Where’s Enes? We’re starting, Ms. Gazal. First, Nevzat is your husband, correct?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, you have the right not to testify. He is your husband. Therefore, I first ask you this: do you wish to testify? No, you can’t just say it casually. Would you like to be a witness? But by law, since Nevzat is your husband, we may ask questions that could reveal his guilt. Because of this, you have the right not to testify. If you say, “I don’t want to testify,” we will respect that. Would you like to testify? As a witness? Yes? Then we will proceed accordingly. We’ll need a Kurdish interpreter… Yes, Counsel. You do not have standing as an intervening party. You are a lawyer from the Diyarbakır Bar Association, but you are not participating in this case.​\n\n\nFemale Lawyer : The request for intervention was denied. There is wisdom in everything.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That must be why we denied it. Why did you request intervention anyway? No, no, I’ve already rejected it. Someone from the police who can interpret Kurdish, please. Go ahead. Now, you—speak some Kurdish with her. Can you communicate in the same Kurdish dialect? Try that. If it works, we’ll continue. Say something—ask how she is, how she feels. Alright, she’ll testify. Yes, since Ms. Gazal can express herself better in Kurdish, a police officer present has been appointed by the court as interpreter. Your full name?​\n\n\nInterpreter : Hacı Ahmet Sardoğan.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you know Ms. Gazal? You don’t. You don’t. Do you swear upon your honor and conscience to tell the truth?​\n\n\nInterpreter : I swear.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, Ms. Gazal, you said you would testify. But since you are the defendant’s spouse, we will hear you without oath. Now, on the day Narin disappeared, did Ms. Yüksel come to your house?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No. She didn’t come.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Not at all?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Not at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t see Ms. Yüksel at all that day?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I saw her at 7 p.m. that day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. She came at 7 p.m. What did she say?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, she didn’t come to our place. Oh, I saw her.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You saw her. Where did you see her?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : The day Narin disappeared—my husband—well, I know a little Turkish.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That’s fine. Half Turkish, half Kurdish, as you wish. What matters is that you can express yourself. Speak in whichever language you prefer. Just tell us what happened.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Okay. On the day Narin disappeared, my husband was in Çarıklı doing electrical work at my son’s house with another worker. Around two, maybe two-thirty, I don’t know. It was hot that day. He came home and said, “I’m hungry, prepare some food.” I prepared his meal. Then he went to pray. He came back, and we ate together. Then he said, “Is our tap water running?” I said, “No, it’s not.” He said, “Let me call Salim.” Salim is the mukhtar.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He said, “I’ll call him so he can fix the water.” He called Salim—right next to me. We were together. My daughter and daughter-in-law were at the neighbor’s house, at Sabri Kaçan’s. Then he talked.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Who was home besides you?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Just me and him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So two of you.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where was your mother-in-law?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : At her own house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So she was home.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And where were you?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : At home too.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I see.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My mother-in-law lives separately. Her house is separate.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, so she wasn’t at your house?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, my mother-in-law wasn’t at our house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, yes. So we were eating together. He said, “Our water isn’t coming?” I said, “No, it’s not.” He said, “Let me call my brother Salim so he can fix it.” He called. Salim said, “Our water isn’t running.” He said, “Call DİSKİ so they fix it.” Then Salim said, “Alright, I’ll call.” My husband hung up. The call lasted barely a minute. Then he said, “I’ll draw water from my mother’s house to water the trees.” We had trees in the yard. He said, “I’ll water them.” I was inside.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He went outside?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Huh? Yes, he went outside to water the trees.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Which trees did he water? We’ve discussed this a lot here—eggplants? No, no—fruit trees.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He went to water the fruit trees.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you see him outside while he was watering?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I was inside. Okay.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You were inside. Did you see him from the window or anything?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, I didn’t. He said he was going to water the trees. I was inside. I don’t know how much time passed, then he said, “I’m going to Çarıklı.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ms. Gazal, you have the right not to answer questions that might incriminate you. I remind you of that. And if I forget during questioning, please, counsel, remind me. We must protect the witness’s rights. Okay. Did you know that the men of the village were away that day?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : What do you mean?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The men of the Güran family had gone out to deliver wedding invitations. Did you know that?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you know they went to Batman or Diyarbakır city center for shopping? Did your husband know? Did you tell him anything about that?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you have such a conversation with your mother-in-law? No? Alright. Then your husband went out. After he left, when did you next speak with him?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t know, maybe twenty minutes, maybe half an hour later. Then he said, “I’m going to Çarıklı. I have some work.” He was doing the wiring at my son’s house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, how long after?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Maybe half an hour, maybe twenty minutes—I don’t know. About that long.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We’re talking about minutes here, Ms. Gazal. We’re analyzing every minute.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t remember the time.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The time is important for us—even a minute.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He said, “I’m going.” I went out to the balcony. He got in the car and left.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You went to the balcony?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes. I saw him get in the car and go.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You saw him get in the car—the red car, Nevzat’s car?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I saw him get in and go.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You saw him get in and drive away. Was anyone else around?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t see anyone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t see Salim either? You may choose not to answer that. Okay? Now, Nevzat says, “I called Salim. About ten or fifteen minutes later, while watering, Salim came and said he needed me for something. I went with him. Then Salim called me to Arif’s house. I saw Narin’s body there. I took it, wrapped it in a blanket, carried it to the barn, got a sack, and then loaded it into the car. I gave the blanket to Salim.” That’s what he says. When you said he left in the car—​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t see him pick up a sack or anything from the barn before getting into the car?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He got in the car through the same gate.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He got in the car. Did he open the back door or put anything inside?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t see.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t see.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you see any blanket at the scene?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, I didn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t see a blanket either? I’m asking to be clear—so it’s not repeated later. You didn’t see any blanket.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : After that, did you see any other car come to where his car was?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Five minutes later? Ten minutes later?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t. He left, and I went inside.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Would you have noticed if another car came? Could you recognize a car by sound?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Our house is higher up.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So if another car came to where your husband’s car had been, could you hear it from the house—while washing dishes, cleaning, watching TV, or doing something else?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why not?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : You can’t see or hear well. No sound came.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t see? No, no, I’m not saying you saw. Normally, say a week earlier, if a car passed by your house on the road, would you recognize it by the sound?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : If a car passed in front of the house?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : If the window was open, I could hear it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : If open, yes. If closed, no. Okay.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, if open, the sound comes. If closed, it doesn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t see any car. You didn’t see a blanket either. Nevzat made a phone call, then went out. You saw him get in the car and leave. Then what—did he go to get cheese? Where did he go?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I had asked my sister for cheese two or three days before. I said, “Make us some cheese.” She was there when I called. It was around five, I think. Nevzat brought us cheese. When he brought it, he left it, sat with us on the balcony for a few minutes, then said, “Ferhat will get off work soon. I’ll pick him up from Çarıklı and bring him home.” He went to get Ferhat. Then I went up to the roof. It was seven o’clock when I went up.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So quite some time had passed.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, when I went up to the roof, it was seven. I went to spread bedding. My mother-in-law was also on the roof. I saw Yüksel Güran, Enes Güran, and Hediye Güran. They were shouting from above and coming down, saying, “Narin is missing. My Narin is missing, Narin is gone.” That’s what she said. I told Yüksel, “Ask your neighbors first. Ask your sisters-in-law. Maybe she’s at one of their houses.” Yüksel said, “My Narin is gone, she’s missing, she’s gone,” and went shouting into the village. We went with her to search near the mosque.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did she say “They killed Narin”?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She said, “Did they kidnap her? Did they kill her?” She was hitting herself as she said it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Wait a minute, wait a minute. You’ll speak; I’ll give you your turn to talk. So, was it more like she was lamenting—hitting her knees in grief—or was she saying, “They killed my daughter”? Because it was only seven o’clock then; it wasn’t yet known whether Narin was dead or not.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She said, “Did they kill my daughter? Did they kidnap her? My daughter is gone.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So she said both.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She was shouting as she came down. Enes and Hediye Güran were with her.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Earlier, you said she was hitting her knees and shouting, “Whichever of you took my daughter, bring her back, even if you leave her in a corner, let it be her grave.”​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, she said that too.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She said that as well? After that, everyone in the village was searching for Narin, talking about her. How was your husband behaving during that time?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : As usual.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you ever suspect your husband?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did he ever act in a way that made you uneasy?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No. If I had suspected him, I would have turned him in myself.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So during those 25–30 days, nothing he did caught your attention?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : If something had, if I had suspected him…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You would have said so.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I would have said it, I would have turned him in. My uncle is a village guard — Mensur Kaya. My cousin Erdal Kaya is a village guard. My cousin Hacı Kaya too. If I had suspected him, I would have turned him in.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You would have turned him in. Do you know that your husband confessed?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : What do you mean?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I just explained — he said, “I went to Salim’s house, then to Arif’s. Salim killed the girl.”​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : We saw that on television.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes. Your husband said the same thing today. He said, “I went to Salim’s house. When I went there, the body was there. I took it, carried it away, and threw it into the creek.” I’m summarizing — not in detail. He said he took it from Arif’s house, from Salim. So your husband said this today. You never suspected him after hearing that? After these events, when your husband was arrested, did anyone from the Güran family come to you?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : To our house?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, to negotiate?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Ali Rıza… what was it, Ali Rıza.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ali Rıza Güran.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, Ali Rıza Güran. He made an offer.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : To you personally? Have you ever seen Ali Rıza Güran before?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : We lived in the village, yes, before.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is he an older man? I haven’t seen him myself.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, he’s old.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, an elderly man.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, elderly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did he come to your house? Where did he make this offer?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My relative Hasan Kaya lives in Batıkarakoç. He called him and said, “If Gazal accepts the children, let her live in her own house in the village. We’ll provide all her needs. Nevzat should take the blame.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did Hasan tell you this?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What did you say?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I said I’d never accept it. Even if they gave me the world, I wouldn’t. Whoever killed that girl, whoever did this, should pay for it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then who told your husband about this offer? How did he find out? He was in prison.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : His brother.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Which one?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Vecdin.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He told your husband?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I think so.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You don’t know for sure? Who told him?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He did. We used to go together to visit him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t tell him, Vecdi did — while you were there?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, he told him. He said, “This man made us an offer.” Yes, we said that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So when you and Vedat — or Vecdi — went to visit Nevzat in prison, you told him?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You were together. Do you remember when this was?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Honestly, I don’t remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You don’t remember — that’s fine. It’s not a problem. I’m only asking insistently in case you might recall. Alright. Do you know Salim’s stepmother, Süveyla?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I know her.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You do. Did you ever speak with her?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : What do you mean?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I mean, during all this, did she ever come and say something to you?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She did.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What did she say?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She said, “Salim has been arrested, and Nevzat will be arrested too.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why would Nevzat be arrested?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I asked her the same thing — “Why?” She said, “They’re going to take his statement.” That’s what she said.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So she said it like that, yes. She’s elderly too?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Not very old.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, Salim was arrested, and Nevzat would be arrested too?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, Salim was already arrested.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Salim was arrested, and Nevzat would be too. When she said this, had Narin’s body been found yet?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Not yet.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Didn’t you ask, “Why”? Didn’t that seem strange?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I did. I said, “Why will Nevzat be arrested?” She said, “No, no, they’ll just take his statement.” That’s what she said.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So maybe she meant it like “taken in for questioning” — not necessarily arrested as guilty?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She said, “Salim was arrested, Nevzat will be arrested.” I asked, “Why will Nevzat be arrested?” She said, “No, no, they’ll take his statement too.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you ask why?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : The statements of everyone in the village were taken.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you saw that as normal — it didn’t make you suspicious. Do you have any hostility with the Güran family?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, we’re on good terms.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : There’s talk about a car. What’s this car issue?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : The car.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I mean, about a debt, payment or nonpayment.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : It was paid — fifty billion. Forty or fifty billion, Nevzat paid.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I see. On that day, after an argument between Nevzat and Arif, when he came home that evening, was he angry? Because they had mocked him.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : If there had been bad blood between them, why would my son have slept at their house?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : The day Narin disappeared — the same day her body was found — my son was at their house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : They were friends, like brothers.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Friends with Muhammed Emre?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, with Baran.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So friends with Baran. He was going to stay there that night?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, and the gendarmes took my son from their house at four in the morning.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Four in the morning? You mean before dawn?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes. We went to Çarıklı together.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Four in the evening or four in the morning?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, no — in the morning.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So before dawn, around four. Because four in the evening wouldn’t make sense. Four in the morning.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : We had no hostility, no fight, no problem. Salim called him “brother,” he called Salim “brother.” Brother, he said — and that brother shot him in the back.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So what’s this car matter? What do you know about it?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : The car issue was that Nevzat had bought it from them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Then Salim took the car from Nevzat.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Then Salim sold it. Later they said the car was involved in an accident. That’s what they said. They said the man crashed it. They said things like that. They agreed to share the money among themselves. Arif paid some. I don’t remember how much Arif paid. Salim paid ten billion. Nevzat paid fifty billion.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When Nevzat paid this money, did he ever say, “I’ll take revenge for this. I won’t let go of even a penny of that fifty thousand lira”?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did he ever say, “I’ll take that money back no matter what”?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Never. He never said such a thing. And even when he paid it, they were like brothers, always visiting each other.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So after that payment, there were no problems, they continued their normal lives?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : They were like brothers. Truly, each called the other “my brother.” Yes. I swear on the Quran. He called him “my brother,” and Salim called him “my brother.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Ms. Gazal, did Salim ever use Nevzat for his personal matters? By that I don’t mean fieldwork or helping with chores — I mean personal matters of a more private nature.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you understand what I mean?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nInterpreter : She understood.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I mean, did he use Nevzat in matters of womanizing or such things?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My husband was not a womanizer.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He wasn’t.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He wasn’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Salim…​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I’ve been married to him for 30 years.​\n\n\nInterpreter : He never spat at me, never cursed me, never cursed our children. He always treated me well. He was always respected in the community.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Well respected. Now, again referring to Nevzat’s confession, alright? Nevzat says: “Salim killed this girl. I had a relationship with Yüksel. The girl Narin saw us. So I killed her. Then I gave the body to Nevzat to hide or dispose of.” No, no, I know you’re not involved — that’s why I’m asking. Would Salim have used Nevzat for his personal matters in such a way? I mean, a person…​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He always called him “brother.” They were like brothers. So maybe if he said something like that to him, it was because he trusted him as a brother, thinking he’d keep his secret.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Would Nevzat reveal a secret?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But he did. So that means Salim trusted him to keep it secret, that’s why he gave it to him.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Salim used him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is this the brother who lives in Diyarbakır or in Istanbul? Do you know him? How many siblings does Nevzat have?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Eight siblings.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What was the name of the one in Istanbul? Or Hatay, right, Hatay. Ah, Vedat or Vecdi, yes. Okay.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you know Vedat?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He’s my brother-in-law.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : During the time when Narin went missing, did Vedat frequently call you or Nevzat, asking, “Has Narin been found?”​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He called Salim and Nevzat. He called them both.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : How did you know he called them?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : We’re always together — we all hear things.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you heard that way?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you hear it on TV or in the village yourself?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, no. Vedat said himself, “I asked Salim, I asked Nevzat if the girl was found.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So Vedat kept calling because he was concerned about the girl?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t know how much he called.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But in that sense, yes? Alright. There was a fight among some women — were you there?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. During the village discussions when Narin was missing — the meetings, the conversations, the gossip — you must have heard people talking, as the whole country was talking about it. Did you ever hear anyone say that someone had killed Narin? Any rumor like that?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Only when Salim was arrested, they said Salim had killed her.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Who said that?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : That’s what people in the village said.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, Salim was arrested, and they said Salim killed her — but the girl hadn’t yet been found?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes. Ms. Yüksel, I’m listening to you. Give her a microphone. Ms. Yüksel, please come here. Give her that microphone.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She was supposed to sit there, but I’m here, let her stay there. She says, Enes, Hediye, and Yüksel came up toward our house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : Everyone here is a witness. First I went to Ayzakaya. There was nothing — we were looking for Narin. I went to the mosque. I was shouting in distress, “Narin is gone.” Then I went back up the hill. İshak Kaya said, “Maybe Narin was here at six.” I went back home again. When I came back down, during the first search at the mosque, she was there. She ran after me saying, “Yüksel, don’t faint. Pull yourself together.” I had been lying in the field all night and all day. Nevzat came and saw me in the field. He ran after me. The day before, when Narin saw him by the stream — for years I treated him kindly like a sister. He came to my house, sat beside me. He said, “Yüksel, forgive me, I couldn’t come see you. The gendarmerie wouldn’t let me.” The day Narin disappeared, I had a dream. There was a fire at Tavşantepe. Then I had another dream yesterday — Narin came home. This wretch said, “Ah, your dreams are strange, Gazal. When Narin went missing, there was a fire. Now you dreamed Narin came home — maybe she really will.” Many of my dreams come true.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What do you want to say?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I’m saying she’s lying.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So that day, around 7 p.m., you, Enes, went to Gazal’s house and said, “Where’s my daughter?”​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She ran after me from the mosque.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That wasn’t her house though. She ran after you — did she say anything like that?​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : She was consoling me. She and Hediye came to my house looking for Narin, asking “Where is Narin?” Someone kidnapped her, someone killed her. That’s what I said.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, you said that.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : I didn’t know then that my daughter was dead. How could I?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes, you said that already. What do you say about this, Ms. Gazal?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yüksel Güran is saying that, but look — at seven o’clock I was on the roof. Yüksel Güran, Enes Güran, and Hediye Güran came down. You say I’m lying, but I’m not. You came down. You were shouting, “My daughter is gone, she’s been kidnapped.” I’m telling the truth, Yüksel. Ferhat Bahtiyar was also a witness. Ferhat was with us at the mosque — the door was locked. Ferhat climbed in through the window and checked the whole mosque. He said, “Maybe the girl fell asleep inside.” I’m not lying.​\n\n\nYüksel Güran : There are many people here, everyone is here. I’m not saying I went at the same minute.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, okay.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : You first came down. You, Enes, and Hediye Güran. You came down. You said it. Then we went with you to the mosque. We searched around and inside the mosque. My son climbed in through the window and checked the whole mosque, saying, “Maybe she fell asleep.” He looked — she wasn’t there. We searched around the village with them until about 10:30.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. Anything else you want to ask? No? Alright then. That microphone isn’t working — switch it.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Excuse me, excuse me, I’d never call this person “my dear brother.” She’s lying.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Question. Do you want to ask Gazal anything?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : She said my husband shot him in the back — how? She should explain.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I’ll explain.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : Go ahead.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I am. How did you do it?​\n\n\nSalim Güran : How did I shoot him in the back?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : You all keep blaming my husband. My husband couldn’t even kill your chicken.​\n\n\nSalim Güran : The camera footage will come out, God willing. That girl never went up the path.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She did. Are the tests lies? Are the samples lies? Is your car a lie? Is everything a lie?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Enes, come here. Do you have anything to ask?​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Ms. Gazal, you say we came toward your house. Which path did we take?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : You came down the footpath.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Which footpath?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, you came down.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I’m not denying I came down, but which way did I come?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : That footpath.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Which one?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Behind my house, you came down that way. It was you.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I came to your house?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : You didn’t come to my house.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Then where?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : You came down, and we went with you to the mosque.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Who was with us?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Your mother and Hediye Güran.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Hediye Güran. Your Honor, when we went up the hill, Hediye Güran definitely didn’t come with us.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : The three of you were together.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : I’m speaking now — you’ll have your turn. Your Honor, I, my mother, and Muhammed Güran went up the hill. We called out to Maşallah Güran. When he said Narin wasn’t there, I took my brother Muhammed and went toward the mosque — to Azize Güran first.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay, you’ve already explained that.​\n\n\nEnes Güran : Yes, Your Honor.​",

When that call happened, was he inside the house?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : When Nevzat was talking on the phone?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You heard that conversation?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I did.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : They talked about the water?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : About fixing the water problem?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : After that, you said he left in the car. You also said, “I looked from above and saw him driving toward the cemetery road.” You have such a statement, right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You saw him leaving by car.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Let me ask you this: after that phone call, how long did it take before he got into the car and left? I’m asking how long passed between that 15:08 call and the time he drove away — ten minutes, five minutes, half an hour?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He talked on the phone inside. Then he went outside. Maybe twenty minutes, fifteen minutes, I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So he didn’t leave right after the call?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, he said he was going to water the trees.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Alright.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Then he left. I don’t know exactly how many minutes passed. Later, he said, “I’m going to Çarıklı.”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Okay. You found out from television that Nevzat had taken Narin and hidden her there, correct?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You didn’t know before that?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Afterwards, you know that he also brought you cheese from Zeynep?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So when he came in the evening, he brought the cheese?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He did.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : After all this, did you ever talk to Zeynep about it? I mean, after Nevzat was caught and sent to prison. She came to you after this incident, right? When Nevzat went to her, he sat there, drank tea, chatted, then came home. Did you ever talk to Zeynep afterward?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Zeynep comes to my house anyway. She’s my sister.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you ever talk to her about this? Look — it was on TV that he took the body to the stream and hid it. He admitted it himself. When he came back, did he say anything to you? Did you ever suspect him?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I asked him. He said he never suspected anything.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : So nothing at all?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Nothing.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Earlier, the Presiding Judge asked about the offer — you said there was one. Actually, it was made to Nevzat’s brother, and then he told him in prison, right? You were there too.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : The offer came to us.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Yes, the offer came to your family. So it was made directly to you?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : To us.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The offer was about Nevzat taking the blame, correct? Who brought this to you?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Hasan Kaya. Hasan Kaya said that Ali Rıza Güran made the offer. He said, “If Gazal accepts, she can come live in the village, stay in her house, we’ll cover everything. Nevzat should take the blame.”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You went to the prison — with Vecdin and Vedat — and his brother told him during the visit?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What was Nevzat’s reaction? You were there during the open visit, right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : What did Nevzat say?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : We said we don’t accept it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Not you — what did Nevzat himself say about the offer?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He said he wouldn’t accept it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did he actually say it, or not?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t remember.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : You don’t remember. What was his reaction then? And before going, did you tell your brothers or Vecdi that you wouldn’t accept this offer?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : That I should accept it, you mean?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Whether you should or shouldn’t.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I was against it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you tell that to your brothers? To Vecdin?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I said something like that.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : To Vecdin?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I said, “Such an offer came, but I’ll never accept it.”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : If you hadn’t been there with Nevzat, do you think he might have accepted it?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : He wouldn’t have accepted it anyway?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, he wouldn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The Presiding Judge asked earlier — their stepmother, as I recall, is Süreyya?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Süveyla.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Süveyla, right. You know, on the day Narin disappeared, she was seen on the school camera, working in the hayloft, packing hay. Do you think Süveyla told you “Nevzat will be arrested after Salim” because she had witnessed something? Or did you think nothing of it afterward? At that point, it wasn’t yet known that Nevzat had hidden the body, but this woman from your village came and said that to you.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : That’s right. Exactly.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did you share that with Nevzat? Tell him, “Süveyla came and said they’ll arrest you after Salim”? Did you ever talk to him about that? Why would she say that to you?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t talk to him about it.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Not at all? You didn’t worry?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, she just said that. I asked, “Why will Nevzat be arrested?” She said, “No, no, I’ll just go give my statement.” That’s what she told me later.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Did she say, “If something happens, I’ll go give my statement,” or “I’m already going to give my statement”?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, no. Süveyla Güran told me, “Salim was arrested. Nevzat will be arrested too.”​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : A few days later?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes. I asked, “Why was Salim arrested? Why will Nevzat be arrested?” That’s what I said.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : In one of your statements, you said, “This family keeps secrets.”​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : What?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : “Keeps secrets.” Maybe you said it in Kurdish, I don’t know. But in your signed statement, it says that phrase.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You can say it in Kurdish, Counsel.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : The phrase “keeps secrets” — was that something you said? Why?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : What do you mean?​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Why did you say they never talk about anything with anyone?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t say “keeps secrets.” I said they were always meeting, always holding family gatherings.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Earlier you commented about the family — that they’re very closed off, they don’t share what happens among themselves with outsiders. That’s what “keeps secrets” means. You also said that after the second day, they shut themselves off, didn’t let anyone else in. By that, did you mean they stopped letting you visit?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : We used to go for two or three days.​\n\n\nLaw. Nahit Eren : Why did you go?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : To see Yüksel. We went, but later they said, “We’re having a family meeting, no one come.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let me clarify — when she said “keeps secrets,” she meant that later, during family meetings, they stopped including her. Is that right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Okay. Anyone object? No. There was a break in the dialogue earlier; let it be recorded correctly. She said she didn’t use the phrase “keeps secrets.” There was some confusion in the transcript. We’ll correct it accordingly.​",

Abdullah Yılmaz : Your Honor, we’ve discussed everything; I’ll just ask one question.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Regarding the sack in the barn — according to the account, he goes to the barn, climbs in through the window, takes a sack, puts the body inside. Did you ever witness anything like that?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : So you weren’t home then?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I was home, inside.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : And you didn’t hear anything?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : It’s a village house, after all.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t see anything. If I had, I would’ve turned him in myself. I swear.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : You went to the prison. Didn’t you ask him about these things? Were you threatened? Was your husband threatened? You mentioned this before — but who exactly threatened him?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : What do you mean?​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : I mean, could your husband commit such a crime?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Such a crime…​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Could he normally commit such a thing?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Who do you think threatened him?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t believe it. My husband could never commit such a crime.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Then why do you think all three of them accuse your husband? Was he being threatened?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Look, I never told you this before.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : You never told us?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Look, in my statement I said — he was threatened. They threatened him and forced the sack and the girl on him. He said, “I took her and hid her.” It was all shown on TV. I didn’t see it with my own eyes.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : You didn’t see it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When you say they didn’t include you in their family meetings, what do you mean? Do you think this was part of some plan to hide something?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I mean, how can I say, Your Honor? Afterwards they would say, “Don’t come.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : “Don’t come.” So they met among themselves. But is that suspicious behavior? Wouldn’t a family prefer to grieve among themselves? Rather than with outsiders? Did that seem suspicious to you? Does their not including you mean they killed Narin?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Your Honor, what I mean is, we went there to console them, but they said, “We’re having a family meeting,” and didn’t let us join. That’s all I know.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Who attended the meeting?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : The family.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsels for Enes Güran ​\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek ​\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You may refuse to answer some of my questions, but if so, please say so clearly. On September 9, 2024, you gave a statement titled “information record.” You said that on the morning of the incident, after breakfast, Nevzat went with your son Ferhat Bahtiyar to the construction site in the Çarıklı neighborhood to do electrical work. Do you remember that?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My husband went there. Not Ferhat — Ferhat was working in Pirinçlik village.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : I’m reading directly from your 09/09/2024 statement. Do you remember this exact sentence?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t remember, but…​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You don’t remember. Okay. Then on September 18, 2024, you gave another statement correcting it, saying Ferhat went separately. Do you remember that one?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t remember that statement. But as I know it, Ferhat was working in Pirinçlik village. Nevzat went to Çarıklı at 06:30 to do electrical work. That’s what I remember. Nevzat had one worker named Vedat. He was an electrician.​\n\n\nInterpreter : Her son worked in Pirinçlik, and Nevzat went alone with one worker.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Yes. Earlier, in response to another question, you mentioned your son Ferhat as a witness — you said, even though Mrs. Yüksel couldn’t ask properly, that your son Ferhat was there that day searching for the girl, right? You said he helped search in the mosque.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, it was around 7. Ferhat came back from work, saw the crowd. We were heading to the mosque with Yüksel, Enes, and Hediye. He asked, “What happened?” We said, “Narin is missing.” My son searched inside the mosque with us. He climbed through the window and said, “Maybe she fell asleep inside.”​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Okay, you remember. You said your son is a trustworthy person like your husband, right?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Isn’t that a strange question to ask a mother, Counselor?​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : It’s fine, Your Honor. Do you consider your son trustworthy?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Trustworthy.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You trust him?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Then why did your son — along with your brothers-in-law, like Mehmet Bahtiyar — initially support the claim that your husband went to work in Çarıklı that day, only for you later to correct and contradict it? Why did you feel the need to make that statement?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My husband wasn’t working there that day — the day he was arrested.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Please just answer the question directly. Or say if you don’t want to answer.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She didn’t understand the question.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Why did you feel the need?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I think she didn’t understand.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : In your first statement, you said, “My son Ferhat and my husband Nevzat went together to Çarıklı after breakfast.”​\n\n\nInterpreter : They left early together — the son went to Pirinçlik…​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : So they left together.​\n\n\nInterpreter : I don’t remember exactly.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Which one? Just now you said your son and husband went together to Çarıklı. Later, you said your son went to Pirinçlik instead.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t remember. I really don’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : So your answer is “I don’t remember,” correct? Okay.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You’re aware, right, that in the ongoing main investigation — file number 202446201 — your husband is currently in custody because it was determined that he lied about the time and location, claiming to be with someone who later said he wasn’t?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I know.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You know. Okay. Earlier you praised your husband. So can we understand this — if you had believed your husband was involved in this horrible crime…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I would’ve turned him in myself. I would’ve.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Let’s confirm that, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I asked her three times. She said it three times.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : I won’t repeat it, Your Honor. Would your trust in him have been broken?​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : She said she doesn’t believe it, right?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Translate that. I didn’t understand.​\n\n\nInterpreter : She said, “Your Honor, I don’t believe he killed her.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : From August 21, 2024, until his arrest, did your husband ever say anything about the murder or act in a way that made you suspect he was involved?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Never. Then let me ask again — why did you say in your statement that he left with your son Ferhat? Why did you feel the need to say that?​\n\n\nInterpreter and witness converse in Kurdish.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : That’s not what I’m asking, but you understand my question. From Tavşantepe to Çarıklı — that’s what I mean. I’m not asking about after Çarıklı. Why did you include your son as if he left with your husband? You trust him; you don’t suspect him of anything.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I mean… yes.​\n\n\nInterpreter and witness converse in Kurdish.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : You’re still not answering.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What did she say, Yüksel? What did she say?​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : She said “I don’t remember,” right?​\n\n\nInterpreter : She said, “He left for work, I just said they went together. Sometimes he left with his sister, sometimes with his uncle, I didn’t see it myself.”​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes, they would leave together sometimes. I said it like that. Sometimes with his sister, sometimes by car. When they left the house, I was inside. They left together, but I didn’t actually see them.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you know he left the house, but not what happened afterward. Is that correct, Counselor?​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Yes. Then why did you later retract that statement in your September 18 testimony? Why did you then say, “My husband went alone, my son went separately with Mehmet Bahtiyar”?​\n\n\nInterpreter : (Unclear, spoke softly.)​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Please translate clearly. I know Kurdish too — we couldn’t fully understand.​\n\n\nInterpreter : She said, “I didn’t know at the time, so I answered that way.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The inconsistency couldn’t be resolved. Let’s end this line of questioning here.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : With your permission, Your Honor, just a final point. Why did your brother-in-law Mehmet Bahtiyar act in sync with you — first making the same statement, then retracting it just as you did? Do you have any idea why?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She said she doesn’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Alright. If I called that coordinated deceit, you’d be offended, wouldn’t you? Your Honor, with your permission, I’ll ask just a few short questions about the day of the incident. Thank you for your patience.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course, go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : On the day of the incident, you, your husband Nevzat, and your mother-in-law were in separate houses. When you say “separate,” do you mean you couldn’t hear each other at all? No sound from one house to the other?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, you couldn’t hear.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : In your statement, you said your husband got in the car and left. Did you see which direction he drove — toward the lower or upper part of the village? Did you look? Toward the school, the cemetery? So to the left, from your door’s perspective?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : To the left, toward the cemetery.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Toward the cemetery. Between the phone call and the moment he left by car, did he leave the house on foot for anything? Did you see?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I was inside.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Did you hear any sound — like him saying “I’m leaving,” or footsteps?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He said, “I’m going to water the trees.” He was watering them in the yard. I was still inside. I don’t know how many minutes passed between. Then he said, “Gazal, I’m going to Çarıklı, I have some work there — electrical work at my son’s house.” Then he said, “I’m leaving.” I said okay. I saw him get in the car and drive downhill.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Thank you.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir ​\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : How often did you see Narin in the village?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Pardon?​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : How often did you see Narin in the village? Did you see her every day?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Narin. No, I didn’t see her.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : You didn’t see Narin?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She wasn’t my children’s age for me to see her.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Didn’t Narin go outside?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She didn’t go outside, but she would go with children her own age. She went to Hacı Hüseyin’s house.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : When she went out, didn’t she pass near your house?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : What do you mean?​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : When Narin went out from her own house.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She doesn’t pass near our house.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Didn’t she go to the mosque?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : There was a road behind as well. And in front of the house too. There was also a road behind our house.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : So that’s why you couldn’t see her, correct? When was the last time you saw her before the incident?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t see her for a month.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : How far is it between your house and Mr. Arif’s house?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : They’re up on the hill. Ours is down below.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Approximately how far? How many minutes’ walk?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : 3–4 minutes.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : It’s 3–4 minutes away, yet you never saw Narin. If you had seen her in the village, would you have spoken to her? Would you have greeted her, for example?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : We would have talked.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : You liked Narin, right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I mean, if I had seen her, I would have spoken. She’s a child.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : You liked her. You would have spoken, right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : If your husband had seen her, would he have spoken to her as well?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Where would my husband see her? How would he see her?​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Don’t they live in the same village? It’s a very small village — say he saw her once every three months, based on your statement. If he saw her once every three months, would Mr. Nevzat greet Narin? “Hello, Narin. How are you, Narin?”​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t see it.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : So you have no guess about this. You can’t speculate, right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t see it; I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Alright. On the 21st, the day of the incident, one of your children stayed overnight at Mr. Arif’s house. What was that child’s name?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : İbrahim Bahtiyar.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Earlier you said about İbrahim Bahtiyar staying there, “We love each other very much. There is no hostility between us,” correct? If there is no hostility, if you are two families who like each other, why wouldn’t Mr. Nevzat greet her when he saw her?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : You’re the one saying he greeted her; I’m saying I didn’t see it.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : There are things you saw and things you guessed.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Maybe he would have spoken.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : For example, if Narin passed in front of him and Mr. Nevzat said “come” to her, called her over, or met at a certain place, would that be a possible scenario?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Narin would not go to anyone.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : She wouldn’t go to anyone. Your houses are side by side. You are two families who like each other. There is no hostility, yet still Narin wouldn’t go to anyone, is that so?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : She was a smart girl.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Then who are you there?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I mean, she wouldn’t go to anyone.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : So you weren’t close, the two families?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I mean, how? We’re not relatives. We’re close, but not relatives.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Alright. I’ll ask you something and finish, Your Honor. Many questions have been asked. Your husband normally goes out for plastering work. On the day of the incident, he went to his son’s house for electrical work, correct?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : You stated that as well. If he goes for plastering work every day, why did he go for electrical work that day?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My son, his house was finished — everything. The belongings had been moved in. Only the electrical work remained. There was an electrician working that day. He was doing the wiring.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Did I understand you correctly? There was an electrician at your son Ferhat’s house, right? Vedat.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Vedat. He went there together with my husband.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Your husband was an electrician, right? Then why did your husband go there with Vedat?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He is an electrician.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Okay, I understood that. I mean, why would your husband, an electrician, go there? The house was empty. Newly finished. No personal belongings.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : That man wouldn’t go to do the electrical work in that house alone. The owner had to be there.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Alright. One last point. They always do character analysis, they ask. I want to hear it from Ms. Gazal as well. I’d like to hear Mr. Nevzat’s character — I mean, in this sense: what was he like in the village, in social life, with relatives?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He was moral, had a good temperament.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Was he a talkative person or more quiet?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Quiet.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : He was quiet? Understood.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Yüksel Güran ​\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu ​\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Ms. Gazal, you mentioned earlier that you have relatives who are village guards.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : In which village do they live?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : In Batıkarakoç.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : In Batıkarakoç. Their surname is Kaya, right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Kaya.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Are there any Kayas in your village, Tavşantepe?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : How many Kaya families are there? Are there more Gürans or more Kayas?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : There are more Gürans.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Alright. Your son was working in Pirinçlik on the day of the incident, correct?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : In the evening, when your husband came home, when he came to Çarıklı, who was driving the car?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My husband was already in Çarıklı. My son came back from work in Pirinçlik. My husband picked him up. They came home together.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Okay. Was your husband driving?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes. Nevzat was driving.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Nevzat was driving. Earlier you said Ferhat went to the mosque when Yüksel was shouting.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : At 7 o’clock my husband and son arrived home that evening. I also went up to the roof. I heard shouting. Yüksel Güran. Enes Güran and also Hediye Güran.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Yes.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : They were shouting out loud. That Narin was missing, that Narin had been abducted. Narin. That’s what she said. So we went with her and searched around and inside the mosque — Ferhat came with us as well. We went together and searched the mosque. My son — the door was locked. He climbed in through the window. He searched the entire mosque, saying maybe the girl had fallen asleep. My son searched the mosque with us. And we walked around the village with Yüksel searching until ten-thirty.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You searched. Then why, while your son was so helpful, didn’t your husband help you? Why didn’t he join the search?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My husband came straight home.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Didn’t your husband do anything then? A child is missing. Didn’t you suggest going to search?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t say anything.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Do you have a grandchild? Is your grandchild around Narin’s age?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My grandchild. Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : For example, did your grandchild ever play with Narin?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : They played at school. They played together.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : They played together. And you’re also neighbors with Arif’s family, right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My daughter is not my neighbor. My daughter is far from me.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You are neighbors, right? No, that’s not what I mean. You are neighbors with Arif, correct?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes. We’re nearby.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You’re nearby. When your grandchild came to you, would Narin never come?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No. She never came.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Wouldn’t they talk there?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I never saw Narin. She never came to my house or my yard. I didn’t see her.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When Salim called on the day of the incident — when he called your husband — you heard it. You said it was about water, right? How long did that conversation about water last?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : It didn’t even last a minute.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Not even a minute. Good, you remember that well. You say it didn’t last a minute. How long after that conversation did Salim leave the house? Sorry—Arif. Nevzat.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : We were at the table, eating and talking.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : How long did the meal take? Did the meal end right after the call?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : The phone rang while we were eating, but I don’t know how many minutes it took.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Our presiding judge tried to understand this with his questions, and so are we. When someone gets a call during a meal, do they continue eating afterward, or stop?​\n\n\nInterpreter : They ate a bit. Sat for a while.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : So he ate a bit after the call, sat a bit, and then said he’d go water the trees?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He didn’t sit long.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : When he went to water the trees, how many trees do you have? Where are they?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : In the yard.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Do you have any eggplants?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Would the eggplants be watered?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : So they wouldn’t be watered that day, right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Hm?​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Since you didn’t have eggplants, they wouldn’t be watered, right?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He watered the trees.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Ah. Your husband—about the eggplants…​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : There were eggplants, yes. Separate ones.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Where were those eggplants?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He just said he was going to water the trees.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Alright. Were the eggplants in the yard or behind the house on the path?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : At that time the eggplants had dried out. There weren’t any.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Yet your husband Nevzat said here that he watered the eggplants behind the house. Your husband says he watered eggplants. Which is true?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : There were eggplants, but wait—there were eggplants, but he told me he was going to water the trees.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It’s in Kurdish, to ensure it’s recorded correctly. I’m saying this because the police officer doesn’t understand it.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Your mother-in-law Zeynep — because of this money issue with Arif, did she ever act cold or distant toward Yüksel’s family or others?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No. I didn’t see anything.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : Did you ever talk about it? Did Yüksel ever ask you, “Why is Zeynep acting like this?”​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t see, didn’t hear anything. We had no hostility between us.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : One last question then. You saw the car in the yard, in front of the gate, right? The red one.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You were on the balcony at that time.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He told me, “I’m leaving. I’m going to Çarıklı.”​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : He called out, “I’m going to Çarıklı.” He started the car and went down the cemetery road.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He went toward the cemetery road. I mean, I didn’t see exactly. He went downhill. I saw clearly that he went downhill, but not which direction he turned.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : And you said there was no blanket exchange?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : We didn’t see any.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : You didn’t see any other vehicle either?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : From where you saw the car move, can you see Arif Güran’s house from there?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : From our house.​\n\n\nLaw. Yılmaz Demiroğlu : From your house?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No, you can’t see it. Ours is lower.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsel for Salim Güran ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ ​\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : By nature, is your husband a fearful person? Does he fear anyone?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : You’ve known your husband for 30 years. Does he fear anyone? Is he intimidated by anyone? Is he afraid of Salim?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Can we quiet the murmuring, please? There’s some noise over there. Thank you.​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He never fought with anyone, so he doesn’t fight with anyone.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Does your husband lie often?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : Never. He never lies. Never. Even if they cut off his head, he wouldn’t lie.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Then how do you explain that he has six statements, all different from each other?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I don’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did you hear your mother-in-law Zeynep Bahtiyar say, “Arif ruined our house, Arif cheated us out of 50,000 lira”?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I didn’t hear that.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : You’ve known your husband for 30 years, you say. Your children know him less than you. For example, Ferhat Bahtiyar said that when my wife Yüksel cried, Nevzat showed no reaction, went home quietly, and watched us from the balcony. Then Fadile said he didn’t join the search efforts. How is it that your children, at their age, sensed his unease, but you did not?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have the right not to answer this question. It’s incriminating. I’m skipping it. This question accuses the witness.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Alright. Another question — on the day Narin was found, when you heard the news, did you faint? Lose consciousness?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : No. We were all crying for her, truly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I intervened in the previous question as well, because the defendant would have been self-incriminated otherwise.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : No problem. Don’t you think carrying Narin’s body is just as cruel as killing her?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She said she doesn’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Then why do you defend your husband so much? If I saw my spouse like that, I’d never defend her. Your husband confessed. In this case, there are only two truths — Narin’s death and your husband’s confession. Everything else is just—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I’m also intervening here. That question would be considered aiding the accused. We’ll skip it.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Fine. What are your husband’s main interests? For example, what does he like to do, what are his hobbies?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : My husband? He always recites prayers, performs his namaz, that’s how he is. He was a clean, decent man.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did he often go fishing?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He went fishing.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Often?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : When he didn’t have work, he went.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : Did he go so often that he knew the Eğertutmaz stream like the back of his hand?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : He didn’t go there, but he went elsewhere. You know, where? The commanders came there that day — he was fishing there.​\n\n\nLaw. Onur Akdağ : People in the village of Gönenli often say this about your husband: “We release carp here so they can multiply and we can collect them later. Nevzat comes, takes the fish, and leaves.” They complain about him. You never saw him go to Eğertutmaz stream?​\n\n\nGazal Bahtiyar : I never saw him go to Eğertutmaz stream. He went elsewhere, with others. They’d get in the car and go together.​",

    "text": "Presiding Judge ​\n\nPresiding Judge : Then under oath. Yes, can everyone please stand? Yes. Ms. Maşallah. Do you swear upon your honor and conscience to tell the truth?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I do.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Look, perjury is a crime. If, at the end of this trial, we reach such a conclusion, we will file a criminal complaint against you. You are currently in custody, correct? For another offense. Therefore, you also have the right not to answer our questions. If you are asked self-incriminating questions, you have the right not to answer them. I will in any case intervene on this matter. Our intention is to take your statements in a comfortable manner, alright? To remain calm.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : First let me talk about this. The fight among the women. What was this quarrel about? Why did you have such a fight? One moment, a murmur has started. I can’t hear myself. There is also a serious murmur by the door. We can bring those by the door over to this side.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : On the day Narin was found, Commander Hülya came. We were all crying. We had all gathered. Commander Hülya came. She informed Yüksel. Yüksel said, “Commander, you had promised me—where is my Narin? You were going to bring my Narin.” At that moment she screamed and fainted. She fainted into my arms. When she fell into my arms, we, together with Commander Hülya and the team, put her in the ambulance. After we did, I returned to my place. Forgive me, I’m a bit…​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : However you feel comfortable.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I sat down. I apologize to all of you. I said, “Narin, which bastards did this to you? Which bastards did this to you? May God curse them.” I apologize. Then someone came—Yüksel’s sister, I forgot her name. She came. “If you had told, this wouldn’t have happened,” she said. “We don’t know anything.” I said, “If you know, then you tell.” Then she spoke about it again. I didn’t speak. My daughter stood up. “If you know, tell. We don’t know anything.” At that moment my daughter fainted. I was tending to my daughter. I took my daughter. I took both my daughters and went home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Which daughter?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Birsen and Melike.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It is said you shouted, “Everyone knows everything. Don’t make me talk.”​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Absolutely not. I didn’t use such words. I do not accept that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you say, “I don’t know anything. If I knew, I would tell”?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : …​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No, no. You just said, “I don’t know anything. If I knew—if you know, you tell.”​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I said it to Yaser, to him. I said, “If you know, you tell. We don’t know anything.”​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It is said the men tried to cover your mouths. Did anyone try to cover your mouth?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Absolutely not. Nothing like that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did anyone try to cover your daughter’s mouth?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No. They were on the other side anyway. Maybe on their side. I took my daughter. I took my other daughter, my younger daughter. I took her as well and went home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You went home. Now then, there is also this statement by Birsen: “Did we do it, so why are you coming at us?” Why did she use such wording, do you know?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I didn’t see that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t hear anything like that?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I didn’t hear it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And Ms. Maşallah. Let me ask the question like this. I will ask the question everyone wants to ask. After these events—that is, after Narin disappeared—it could be about Narin, or Salim, or Yüksel, or Enes, or Nevzat. Did anyone direct you? Did they tell you to give false statements in this manner?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No, absolutely not.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because you say Narin came to our house. You say you heard it from your daughter.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Narin comes around two o’clock. She asks for my daughters. At that time my daughters go to the mosque. Before noon I take my daughters and leave them at my mother’s. Then I come home. My daughters stay there. After that Narin comes. Around two o’clock. My daughter opens the door. She didn’t stay two minutes. She said, “Where are Hatice and Fatma?” I said, “At their grandmother’s.” My daughter didn’t know they went to the mosque. Then she told me. I said, “We left them at the mosque.” She said, “Alright, Narin came.” She said, “Alright.” Then the reason we said 05:40 is that Mina came. When Mina came—when Narin disappeared—I completely forgot Mina. I kept saying Narin. There was no ulterior motive, sir.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So when you said Narin came at 05:40, actually it was Mina who came. Mina came.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : The confusion came from that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And this is your statement? The date you gave your statement is 29.08. So about 7–8 days after the incident.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : As I’m saying—Narin was on my mind the whole time. Narin was constantly with us.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I understand.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : She was like my child too.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So Narin came in the morning. Around two o’clock. Yes. Now, there is that well-known video. The one that caused serious debate on social media. Narin comes and then runs off. At that time—in between—did Narin come to your house?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : At what time, sir?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Two, two…​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes, yes, she goes to the mosque.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So at that time Narin comes to your house. She asks for your daughters. Because your daughters aren’t at home, she runs to the mosque. On social media there were reports like “What did Narin see that made her run?” Before that video, she came to your house, asked for your daughters, and when she didn’t see them, we presume she went to the mosque to catch up with them.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Because the three of them had agreed the night before.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Around seventeen, seventeen-thirty Narin did not come. On the day of the incident, you only saw Narin at two o’clock.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I didn’t see her. My daughter opened the door.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You said she opened the door at seventeen-forty. Mina came.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Mina came.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When you said you heard from Birsen that you saw Narin, in fact you meant the morning time, but it got recorded as around seventeen-thirty.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : When she disappeared, the confusion came from that. There was no ulterior motive. We wanted her found quickly.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I understand. So giving a false statement in this way to steer someone—by Salim—​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because there is an allegation in the indictment. The prosecution alleges this. It says Salim arranged this. Because Birsen has a statement—was it Birsen?—rather, Melike has a statement: Salim came to us and said, “Say she came at 17:40.” Given that, is it possible Birsen made such a statement?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : There is no such thing, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : That day—​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Birsen and Salim—after Narin disappeared—talked about the timing. He told me about it—he explained it to me at home. “Whichever time she came, tell our state that time so she can be found quickly.” That’s what he said.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : But your daughter has a statement like “Say 17:40.” Do you have any knowledge about that?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I have no knowledge of that.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : During these events, did Salim ever come to your house?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Salim came. He came at six, six-thirty. He kissed his uncle’s hand. He kissed his aunt’s hand. His aunt had just arrived. Since we had come from Mersin, he asked about us, too. At that moment, I went upstairs. When I came back, he had left. He didn’t stay at our door for five minutes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When you say his uncle—do you mean your father-in-law?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No, my husband, Hüseyin Güran.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Hüseyin Güran, pardon. Hüseyin Güran is Salim’s uncle.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes, he is his uncle.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where had you come from on the day of the incident?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : We had come from Mersin.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You had come from Mersin. He came at six to kiss his uncle’s hand.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes, he came. His uncle was at the door, as was his aunt.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you remember the exact time?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I don’t remember exactly. It was around six, six-thirty.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did you speak with Salim at that time? Did you see him?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I saw him. He was with his son.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : As of that date, Narin had disappeared. According to one claim, Salim killed Narin. Did you sense anything suspicious about Salim?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No, he was as he is every day.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Normal, as he is every day?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Normal—as he is when he comes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : No panic? No excitement?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I didn’t see any.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So, as far as you saw, you didn’t suspect anything?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No. In any case, at that moment I went upstairs, and when I came back, he was gone.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Do you know Nevzat?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Of course, he is our neighbor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : He is your neighbor. Yes. How were relations, generally, between Nevzat and the Güran family? Or between him and Salim Güran?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Generally it was good. Up to this day it was good for us. But from now on, for us, it isn’t good.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Why?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Suspicion keeps going to him. It goes to Salim, too.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It goes to Salim. It goes to Yüksel. It goes to Enes. Suspicion is now split into four. It goes to all four.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Then if it’s split into four, bring out that station camera. Bring it out.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : God willing. God willing.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : God willing, if it comes out, everything will be revealed.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : God willing.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Even if it’s one of us, may God curse them, whoever it is.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It will come out. We will request the camera, too. You did not witness any problem between Nevzat and Salim up to now. But after this incident, because you suspect Nevzat, you’ve cut him off.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I learned these things at the station anyway.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : After that, you cut off Nevzat. But you have no prior enmity with Nevzat?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Setting aside your suspicions—clearing yourself of them—I ask you this: Is it possible Nevzat could kill someone?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Up to now, no.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Aha. Up to now, no. Is it possible Salim could kill someone?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Not for him either. To this day, with so many children, not a single slap did we take from him.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Then is it possible Yüksel killed her daughter, or Enes killed his sister?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I don’t believe it.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I don’t believe it. Who is Delal Kaya?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : She is my niece.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : And Mahide Kaya. Did they come to the house?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : What time did they come?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I don’t know the exact time. They had come to the village. They called me. I had asked for it. I said, bring me socks.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : They sell socks, right?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : They don’t sell. A driver had brought them. I said, bring them to me. They brought me the socks; I bought them and they left. I bought socks. They left for home.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Did they come before Salim arrived or after?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I don’t exactly remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Because Mahide says in her statement that she saw you around 18:00, that’s why we ask. Was the time Mahide came to you before or after Salim came?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I don’t remember. I don’t remember.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Now this—where is your house?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : In the village.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Where in the village?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : A bit outside the village. Behind the school.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : On a hill?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Not on the hill. Just below the hill.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So it’s not in a place where you can easily have a full view of your surroundings when you look around, correct?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : My house is the only one there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : The only one.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Behind the school.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Your house, that is. Where is Arif’s house? How far is it?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Since it’s on a hill, a drop-off, I can’t say how far.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let me put it this way. From your house, can you see Arif’s house?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : From below?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : From your house, Arif’s house.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I can see the tops of the structures.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Can you see the garden or the barn? Because Yüksel first comes to you, right? Asking where Narin is.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes, she calls from the hill.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She calls out, “Where is Narin,” right? Is that because she went to Qur’an class together with your daughter? In other words, at the time Narin was killed, between 15:15 and 15:30, did you observe any activity at Yüksel’s house?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I did not. I didn’t leave the house at all.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You didn’t go out at all. Can you see Nevzat’s house?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I cannot see his house.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : So you didn’t see or hear any vehicle, a red car, a white car, any such activity?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I didn’t hear. If it passed at my door, I would surely hear it. I didn’t see it pass at my door either.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You said Narin came at 2, correct, Ms. Maşşallah? What time did Mine come?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : It was 17:40.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You say Mine came around 17:40. Because you mixed it up.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I understand.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : We mixed that up.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What time did Yusuf Kaya come? He is your nephew as well, right, Yusuf Kaya?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : He is my nephew. It was around one-thirty. He and my son left the house at around two, two-thirty.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Why did Yusuf come to the house?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : He brought us bread. We were out of bread. My husband wasn’t home either. We called; he brought us bread.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Did you have breakfast late?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : So did you have breakfast around one-thirty?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : We had it together when my daughters came.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Around one-thirty.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Later than that, late.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : In your statement you say Yusuf Kaya came around 15:00. Around three.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No, no, not around three.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : What time then?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No, I kept saying—​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Skip that Yusuf business. What time did you have breakfast? It’s actually a very simple question.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : We had breakfast around three, three-thirty.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Right? Yes. You gave your statement that way.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You say Yusuf Kaya brought bread around three. And Maide Kaya—she is your husband’s niece, right? You are Maide’s aunt?​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Yes, her aunt.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : And Zelal?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I am her maternal aunt as well.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I see. Because of this sock matter, they say they came to you around 17:00. They say they left the house at 17:00—pardon, 17:30–17:40. The children say they were at your house around that time.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Fine, they brought socks. Exactly. But I cannot say what time it was.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Maide says that while we were at the house, only Yusuf knocked on the door. Yusuf—uh. I’m telling you the statements. Please answer. Around 17–18 only Yusuf came, she says. So she says Yusuf came at 17:00.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Prosecutor, my nephew Yusuf is one person; my husband’s grandson is another. Yusufcan Güran is another. There are two Yusufs.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Two Yusufs. Yes. They say the Yusuf who came around 18:00 was Yusuf Kaya. Maide is referring to Yusuf Kaya.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Maide did not see Yusuf Kaya.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Understood. She didn’t see him.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : They took my son; they went to the coffeehouse together.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Alright. One more thing, Your Honor—there are also two phone records I wanted to show, if you agree.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : This is Birsen, in her first statement. Yes. In her first statement about two o’clock, she says, “My mother was speaking with Sister Zerrin.” Around fourteen.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I spoke with her too.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Could you hand the microphone to the Prosecutor?​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Around two o’clock—with Sister Zerrin— I have the call detail records. Around 13:32, registered to the name Taner Mehmetoğlu.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : She is also my sister-in-law.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Which Zerrin is this? Your Sister Zerrin?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : She was my husband’s daughter.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : There is no number saved as Zerrin?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I don’t know numbers.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I see. Around 14:00—this sister-in-law of yours? Is Taner Mehmetoğlu your sister-in-law?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Because it’s registered in his name.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Ah, so that’s the one. Yes. Alright. So there is no Zerrin listed here, correct? Not among these numbers right now?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I don’t know numbers.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You know this is your sister-in-law though. Look, let me say something. Listen to me. In your call records there is only 13:32. You have no call at 14:00. Do you understand me? So there is no Zerrin. I am asking you only about the 13:30 I have in hand.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Not Zerrin. Look, I also spoke with Zerrin. I don’t know at what time. Fatma is my sister-in-law.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : I’m telling you about her daughter. Alright. You say you don’t know.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Fine. She may have mixed it up too.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Alright. She gives very exact times like 17:40. That’s why I ask. Birsen says, “She was speaking with Aunt Hatice around 17:40; that’s why I mixed up the two o’clock.”​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : After Narin disappeared, we all mixed things up.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Aunt Hatice. Yes. Look at these numbers too. You don’t know them?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I don’t know numbers. I cannot read or write.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : How did you immediately recognize your sister-in-law then?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Because you said it?​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : Alright.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I say it because I speak with my sisters-in-law.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : But you didn’t identify it by seeing the number?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : But I don’t know numbers.​\n\n\nTrial Prosecutor : You don’t know the numbers?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I don’t.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Yes. I am illiterate. I cannot recognize the numbers you showed me. However, on the day of the incident whom did you speak with?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : My sisters-in-law. Two sisters-in-law. And we spoke with our girl Zerrin.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : We spoke with our girl Zerrin.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : Now, you say Narin came to the house twice.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Is that microphone not working? Is there sound? Could you check, Mr. Mehmet? Is the battery dead? Try turning it off and on. If that doesn’t fix it, it’s broken. Is it okay now?​",

    "text": "Diyarbakır Bar Association ​\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş ​\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : Now, your statements that Narin came to the house twice that day later turn into she came once. You also say you were on the phone with your sister-in-law; when your daughters commented about the time, then you realized the correct version and say Narin actually came to the house at two o’clock. However, these are independent of the time of your phone call. According to your first statement, and even your other statements, first around two o’clock the doorbell rang. After it rang, my daughter opened the door; I was busy. I asked Birsen or my other daughter who had come, and they said Narin came. Toward evening around five the doorbell rang again and I again did not look at the left door. My daughters looked. When I asked my daughters who had come, they again said Narin came.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : One moment, let our counsel finish.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : This is something included in your signed statement. So rather than you mixing up the time, there is a situation where you asked immediately after the door closed on two occasions and received the answer Narin both times. Why did you give a statement to this effect?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : That was confusion. After Narin disappeared, Mina came at that time. I repeat, Mina came. Since after Narin disappeared she was constantly on my mind, I kept saying Narin.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : Didn’t your daughter actually say “Mina came” the moment the door closed?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : They told me Mina came. She said that. Mina came slipped my mind. After Narin disappeared, Mina completely left my mind. Completely. Narin is all that’s on my mind.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : When Salim came to your house that day, did he make a phone call at the house? Did you see?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I wasn’t outside at that time. I went upstairs. He came and kissed his uncle’s hand, kissed his aunt’s hand. He asked after us. We had come from Mersin. He was with his son at that time. I went upstairs; when I came back he was gone. He didn’t even stand at the door for five minutes.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : After Narin disappeared, when the search began, did Enes come to your house to ask about Narin?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No. Yüksel called me.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : Enes did not come?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No, I did not see Enes. I did not see him.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : When Yüksel called out to you from the hill, you responded along the lines of “Are you only now searching for your daughter at this hour?”—is that correct?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : My husband scolded her.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : Normally, around what time do Narin and the other children go home? Your daughter is also little. When she plays, around what time does she go home?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : If she gets permission from her mother, she goes home even late. Since she’s at my house, her mother is at ease. If I send my daughters to her house, I’m at ease as well. We send our children to each other.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : Did your children come often?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes. She would also frequently leave them with me and go to Batman. Even if there was a mourning, she would go. They would leave them with me.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : So when her mother sent Narin to you, would she ever confirm whether she arrived? Would she call you? “Did she come?” Or when you sent your children?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No, if she was with me, she was at ease. She knew. She knew I wouldn’t let her go. But that day Narin came to us. When she came, it was to ask about my daughters. She went to the mosque. I did not see Narin after that.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : After Narin disappeared, did you observe any carpet washing, blanket washing, a general cleaning at Yüksel’s house?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Metin Arkaş : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir ​\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Are you saying that the argument among the women that day never happened, or are you saying you didn’t hear it? Did you not witness such an argument, or did it not happen at all?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She said it did happen.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I said it happened.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : She said it happened. There was an argument.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did Nesrin Güran utter any insult in your presence?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Did she turn somewhere and say something, insult someone?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Nesrin Güran would not put such words in her mouth.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : She would not. Alright. Did your daughter Birsen ever say to you, “Salim told us to say we saw the girl at 17:40, to say we saw Narin, otherwise there will be trouble,” anything like that?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : You were held in custody. How many days were you together?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : The custody period—​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Within the family.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : That’s separate—this is my 56th day. I am in prison.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : What I’m asking about your daughter is this. During that period in custody and the prior period—your own biological daughter.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : She has a clear statement: “Salim told us to say we saw her at 17:40, otherwise there will be trouble.” You have been arrested over the time issue as well. That is the reason for your arrest. Did you never have such a conversation?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : With Salim?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I asked this question as well. I asked this question as well.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I asked it very clearly. Very clearly indeed.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : My last question: Did you ever hear in the village about a problem between Arif and Nevzat?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I did not hear. I was not at home.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : How many years have you been living there in the village?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Since I was born.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Since birth. If there had been a feud or a problem, wouldn’t a closed community hear of it? You would.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I would.​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you. Now, Ms. Maşşallah. When Narin came to your house to play with your daughters, would Arif or Yüksel call you to ask if she had come?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Not by phone. Is that what you mean?​\n\n\nLaw. Aydın Özdemir : No, no—in general. A week before, a month before—routinely. Since she would routinely come, I also send my child to the neighbor across the way. You send yours too. I was curious how Arif confirmed that Narin had come to your house.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : She would come with her mother’s permission.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When she came, would Yüksel keep track of her daughter?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Of course, Yüksel would keep track of her daughter.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : How would she keep track?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Wouldn’t a mother keep track of her child?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : When it got dark in the evening, how would Narin return home?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : When it was dark, either my son would take her or my two daughters would take her.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I see. So they would take her and she would go home. They would take her like that.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes.​",

    "text": "Ministry of Family and Social Services ​\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun ​\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : In your statement dated 12.09—that is, September 12—more than 20 days after the incident, you say Narin came home at 17:40. How did the “40” remain in your mind so precisely up to the minute? What is the significance of “40” for you?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Counsel, I asked that as well; we are moving on. I asked it very clearly three times; we are moving on. We asked; we are moving on.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : She may ask.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I asked, I asked. We’re moving on; we asked.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : On the day of the incident, at 7 o’clock was Yüksel speaking there? Were Enes or Muhammed present? Or was anyone else there?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : When Yüksel called me, my husband was there. My sister-in-law was there.​\n\n\nLaw. Elif Aslı Şahin Torun : Was anyone with Yüksel?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No, she was alone. There was no one else.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz ​\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Now, Your Honor, first I would like to correct something, and we have a request from you. You and the defense keep saying these questions have already been asked, but I think that’s the logic of cross-examination—questions may be the same, phrased differently. We can ask the same question to each witness, frankly. Because one witness is being heard while the others have not yet been heard. So saying this has been asked—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : I reject that as well. I believe asking a question once to a witness is sufficient. I reject that too, Counsel. Go ahead.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Ms. Maşşallah, Mr. Nevzat—Nevzat Bahtiyar—also made an allegation against you. What do you think about this with regard to Mr. Salim?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I do not accept that. I do not accept it—let him first look to his own circle. Let him look in the mirror. A person does not hide behind slander. He does not slander.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Why do you think he slandered you? Did you have bad relations?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Why did he make such a slander then?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Ask him.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : We asked him as well.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Then ask him again. Why is he making this slander? A person does not slander. He speaks properly, with honor and dignity. He does not hide behind slander.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Look—Narin disappears, is murdered, and is found 19 days later. During those 19 days a lot happens in the file. There are fires, the electricity goes out, there are contradictory statements. Just your two daughters Melike and Birsen have three different statements. You have different statements. All of them contradict one another. Therefore, did you never discuss anything that would arouse suspicion as to who did it? For example, did you not speak with your daughter Birsen?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I mean, talking—​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Like, who killed this girl? Did you ever think about it?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Me—Narin?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : We didn’t think about it. They asked whom we suspected. No one in the village came to mind. In the end we thought she had been abducted. But she was right under our noses; we didn’t know.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : Who do you think killed her? Nevzat?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : You have the right not to answer this question as well. No, do not answer. There is no crime and evidence in these things. I will not take an answer.​\n\n\nLaw. Abdullah Yılmaz : That’s all for now, Your Honor.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Now, I am meeting you with understanding. I think I allowed this quite a bit yesterday as well. When you ask the same question ten times— I asked it, that side asked it, that side asked it, that side five times each… No, no, it has been asked. Whether sensitivity was shown or not— not as criticism, nor as defense. I did that yesterday. But after the situation following the initial beginning today, I changed my mind. I am no longer allowing it. After I receive the answer to the question I asked, there is no such thing as you getting a different answer.​\n\n\nDefendant Enes Güran : Aunt, you say he went up the hill. Then I was with my mother too. Muhammed was with her, too. Did you see us or not?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : On the hill? When your mother called me. I did not see at that moment, my dear. I did not see.​\n\n\nDefendant Enes Güran : Okay.​\n\n\nDefendant Salim Güran : The defendant Maşşallah Güran is my uncle’s wife. My uncle is not like a father figure; he is my father. He raised us, fed us. May God damn the one who made this slander; may he burn in the fires of hell.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Question, question, question. No question. Thank you. We will take questions. Counsel for the defendant, please proceed.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsels for Enes Güran ​\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek ​\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Ms. Maşallah, do you remember on which day and at what times you first saw Enes during the search and sweep activities?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : On the day Narin disappeared?​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Yes, take that as the basis. After that, did you see him on the 21st or the 22nd? If on the 21st, within what time frame; if on the 22nd, when did you first see him?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : On the 20th, we had just come from Mersin. We had gone for my daughter’s enrollment. With that travel fatigue and then this incident on the 21st, I did not see Enes. I did not see him during the day. I saw Enes when he called me; I saw him then. I saw only Yüksel. He may have been up above, but I saw only Yüksel. Because there were trees between us. I did not see him.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : When?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : When Yüksel called me— it was seven, seven-thirty.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : No, try to recall when you saw Enes.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : You mean at the time she disappeared. At the time Narin disappeared.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Go back from today to the day Narin was killed; try to recall the first moment you saw Enes— face to face, as we are seeing now.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I saw him next to the school. I saw him while we were searching for Narin.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Which day was that?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : The first day she disappeared.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Alright. Did you see Enes’s face and body?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Of course.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Did you notice any injury, bruise, bleeding on his face?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I did not.​\n\n\nLaw. Mahir Akbilek : Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you. Yes, Ms. Maşşallah. Thank you. There is a question, please. I thought we were done.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : You say you spoke on the phone that day. Was it only with your own phone, or…?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No. I also spoke with my daughter’s phone. I will speak.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Then could this be the reason the call record cannot be understood there? You spoke using your daughter’s phone that day, correct?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes. I spoke with my daughter’s phone. I spoke with my own phone. I spoke with my son’s phone.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : You said you had come from Mersin the day before.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Do you remember how many children came and went to your home that day? How frequently did they come?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Normally, children always come to my home. I love children. I love children.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : I am asking specifically about that day, for this reason: given your house’s location, the road apparently doesn’t go beyond your house. That is, when you go along the road passing in front of the school, you arrive at your house.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : The camera shows quite a bit of activity— Yes.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Children come to my home.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Was there very frequent coming and going of children to your house that day? That’s what I’m asking.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : There was.​\n\n\nLaw. Mustafa Demir : Yes, thank you.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir ​\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Do you know Gazal Bahtiyar?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yes. She is my neighbor.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : How are relations between you? How is your communication with her?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Well—​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Before the incident.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Before the incident it was good. She would come and go. I gave her my garden. She would plant my garden. Our relations were good.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Where did Narin and your children generally play in the village? In front of the school? Near the mosque?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : They would be in front of the school as well. They would go to the front of the mosque, too. They would also go to my mother’s. Our children could go anywhere comfortably in our village.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : In the last three months before the incident, is it possible that Gazal Bahtiyar or Nevzat Bahtiyar might not have seen Narin?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : On that day?​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : In the month or two or three prior— it doesn’t matter.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : How would they not see her? If they went down, they would see her; if they went up, they would see her. How would they not see her?​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Alright. Was there any problem between the Nevzat Bahtiyar family and the Arif Güran family? How were relations prior to the incident?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : There was no problem at all.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : There was no problem.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : There wasn’t. As far as I know, there wasn’t.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Now, I’m asking for Narin— for the deceased. Was Nevzat Bahtiyar a stranger to her?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Pardon?​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Was he a stranger to Narin? Or would she see him like an uncle? I mean, would she like him?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Well, when his grandchildren were around, he would love his grandchildren. He would go.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Then would Narin go if Nevzat Bahtiyar told her to come? Would she say, “Hello Uncle Nevzat,” greet him?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Since I did not see it, I cannot say anything about that.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : You did not see. I am not asking you for something you did not witness. But since you are in the village, you can make an inference. It is a general situation.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let’s not take conjecture. She said she did not see.​\n\n\nLaw. Muhammed Fatih Demir : Thank you.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Thank you.​",

    "text": "Defense Counsels for Yüksel Güran ​\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır ​\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : How were relations between you and Yüksel Güran?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Very good. Good with all of them.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Before and after the day of the incident, did you ever notice any unusual act or behavior by Yüksel Güran?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : When she called me, she called me in her normal manner. She called me as she does every day.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Alright. Now, there is a report drawn up by the gendarmerie personnel dated 09/08/2024. In that report there is an interpretation— this is our view as the defense. The interpretation of an interpretation has been carried into the indictment. I will ask only this: At the time the argument took place, was Yüksel Güran there? Or during that argument did Yüksel Güran have, say, a nervous breakdown? Could you tell us this incident in full detail?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yüksel Güran fainted. She fainted before that argument took place. We took her into the ambulance. We took her into the ambulance. I returned to my place. Then this argument happened.​\n\n\nLaw. Furkan Çakır : Alright. Thank you.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Yüksel was not there.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Thank you very much.​\n\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş ​\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : Now, it may merely be hearsay, but I am asking to clarify. It is said that there was a problem arising from vehicle trade between Arif and Nevzat Bahtiyar. It is said the congregation imposed a penalty on Nevzat Bahtiyar— that a payment was imposed on him. And after he paid, there was unrest within the household. Later, from your house, Gazal Bahtiyar—that is, Nevzat Bahtiyar—​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Let him finish his question.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : While she was at your place, it is said she made a statement like, “I do not give my blessing. We paid this money. We were put in a difficult position. We do not give our blessing.” It may be just such a saying, but it is said this incident took place in your house. Did such an incident occur?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : Absolutely not. Absolutely not in my house. Not in my house.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : In your house, did Gazal Bahtiyar ever make such a statement of the kind, “Because we paid this money, we do not give our blessing”— something like a protest?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I do not remember that. I was not at home. I was not at home for a month and a half.​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : After little Narin disappeared, among the women who came to visit you, did Gazal Bahtiyar ever say something like, “We are leaving here anyway. We will move our home. We will go to another province. We will go to Istanbul”?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : When she disappeared?​\n\n\nLaw. Tuncay Erkuş : In the dates after the disappearance— it could be a few days later, a week later.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : In other words, did Gazal say such a thing?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : No.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Alright. Thank you. Thank you.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : In fact, I want to say this.​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : Of course.​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : There was no fire. I mean, it had not broken out. The day before that we were at Yüksel’s. We sat and talked. I had a dream. Çilye— that is, Tavşantepe— was burning. She even cried. I also asked for a cigarette. I gave her a cigarette. Then the next day the village burned. Could such a thing be?​\n\n\nPresiding Judge : It can. Why not? There is a realm of dreams. I mean, I believe in dreams. Not “the presiding judge believed in dreams,” but I do believe. Don’t you?​\n\n\nMaşşallah Güran : I do.​",
