<p><span class="speaker suspect">Enes Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">I came from Arguvan, Malatya. I was an excavator operator. On the 20th of the month, I came home. I arrived home around half past one at night. My father picked me up from the bus terminal. Then my father went up to the roof to sleep. I heated up the meal my mother had prepared for me. I started eating. My mother came down from the roof. She kissed me. While she was heating the meal—sorry, while I was heating the meal—my mother came, she kissed me. She sat for a while. Then she went back up to the roof; I heated my food and ate. In the morning, I woke up around seven-thirty. When I woke up, I saw my mother inside, I saw Muhammed and Eren. I sat with them. Eren came, sat on my lap, we talked together, and later my father Arif Güran, my brother Baran Güran and Narin Güran came down from the roof. After that my mother went to prepare food for us. She cooked, left the meal. Muzaffer Güran came and joined us for lunch. After we ate and everyone got up, I heard that my father and Muzaffer Güran would go to Batman; my father and Muzaffer Güran left for Batman. My brother said he would take his wife shopping. At that time, it was just my mother, Muhammed, Eren and Narin at home. We were sitting, watching TV, the air conditioner was on, it was hot outside, so we didn’t go out. Then I noticed my mother leaving the house, holding a washbasin—we call it <span class="quote-grey">“teşti.”</span> Since I came from Arguvan in Malatya, all my clothes were dirty. My mother was taking them to Hediye Güran. I told her okay. She left. Then Muhammed, Eren, Narin and I stayed home. We sat, watched TV. As it got late, we started to call my mother so she could come prepare dinner. Then my mother came later and prepared food for us. Around 12 o’clock we sat for lunch. We ate. After the meal I sat on the couch. Narin came next to me. I was on social media; she was watching me. Then I noticed Narin looking at the clock. When I turned around, she was checking the time. She said to my mother, <span class="quote-grey">“It’s one o’clock, mom, I’m late for the mosque, I’ll go.”</span> My mother said, <span class="quote-grey">“It’s hot, don’t go today.”</span> Narin said, <span class="quote-grey">“Hatice and Fatma are going, so I’ll go too.”</span> My mother said okay, then Narin got up and left. I didn’t see Narin again. Later, since I went to bed late and woke up early, I was very sleepy. After about five minutes, I lay down on the couch and slept. Around four o’clock I woke up. While sleeping, someone had called me—Şahin from Malatya, a friend from Arguvan. He called me while I was asleep and then hung up. Around four I woke up. I saw my mother and Hediye Güran. They were chatting. Muhammed was sleeping. I said to my aunt, <span class="quote-grey">“Welcome, aunt.”</span> She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Thank you. How are you? Are you well?”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“I’m fine. How are you?”</span> She said, <span class="quote-grey">“I’m fine.”</span> Then I went outside, went down toward the fountain. There’s a tree next to the grocery shop. I sat there. Then Tahir Kaya came over. We chatted a bit.<a href="#L004" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

<p><span class="speaker suspect">Enes Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">I was sitting by that tree next to the grocery. Tahir Kaya came to me, we talked. Since it was hot, I wanted to buy an energy drink. I went into the grocery, bought one. I noticed Süleyman Kaya coming in after me. He is mentally disabled; I felt pity and said, <span class="quote-grey">“What do you want? Let me get you one too.”</span> He said okay, <span class="quote-grey">“Get an energy drink.”</span> I bought one for him as well. I had 200 lira—my father had given it to me that morning before going to Batman. I gave it to the shopkeeper; he gave me the change. When I left the store, I noticed Muhammed Yağmur. I went to him, we talked. Then Kerem Güran and Muhammed Güran (my brother) came. Kerem said, <span class="quote-grey">“Welcome, uncle.”</span> While Muhammed and I were talking, Süleyha Güran came. She told Kerem Güran to help carry her hay. Kerem said, <span class="quote-grey">“Our backs hurt, we can’t.”</span> Then Süleyha noticed Tahir and walked toward him. Meanwhile, Muhammed Güran and Kerem Güran went down to the lower part of the village, while Muhammed Yağmur and I continued talking. Then I saw Şevket Susam coming out to his doorway. We chatted a bit. Later I saw Muhammed Kaya in front of Azize Kaya’s house near the grocery. I went over, Şevket and Muhammed followed me. The four of us sat and talked. Then Muhammed Yağmur and Şevket said they would go home. Muhammed Kaya and I went to the fountain side, and Süleyman Kaya, the mentally disabled one, came with us. Muhammed Kaya and I were chatting while Süleyman listened. I saw Muhammed Yağmur come out of his house, getting into a car. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Where are you going?”</span> He said he was going to wash the car. I asked, <span class="quote-grey">“Can you drop me home?”</span> He said no. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Then drop me by the school, I’ll walk up the hill.”</span> When I reached the school area, I saw kids carrying hay. My step-grandmother Süveyla Güran asked me to help carry her hay; I couldn’t say no, so I told Muhammed to drop me near the mosque, and then I went straight up the hill home. I sat in the same room, on the same couch.<a href="#L010" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

<p><span class="speaker suspect">Enes Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">Then I started using my phone again—social media, YouTube. Since I had come from working away and my slippers and shoes were torn, and I knew my brother Osman was working at Ongözlü and would come early, I called him. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Bring me a pair of slippers.”</span> He said, <span class="quote-grey">“Okay, brother.”</span> Then while I was on my phone, my mother came and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Call your father and brother; will they make it for dinner or not?”</span> I looked at my phone and saw it was off. Yüksel Güran is my mother. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, bring your phone, I’ll call them from yours.”</span> Since my mother cannot read or write, I dialed myself and handed her the phone. Both of them said they would be late for dinner. Then, Your Honor, my mother said, <span class="quote-grey">“The barn window is open; the turkeys are getting out and the dog eats them.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Okay, mom.”</span> I went up toward the barn, told her she could come with me. When I went there, I noticed Ferhat Kaya, Ufuk Kaya and Furkan Kaya on the hillside. Ferhat Kaya kept calling me insistently, <span class="quote-grey">“Come, come.”</span> When I went toward them, they had a red dog. It came to me. Ferhat came near me and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Come on, I came to you, if you don’t come now…”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“I’m not coming, really; my mother will call me anyway.”</span> He said okay. <span class="quote-grey">“We have guests,”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Then I’ll go home.”</span> He said okay. Ufuk Kaya came with me. Furkan Kaya didn’t. Ufuk and I went to the small hill right next to the barn and sat there. While Ufuk and I were chatting, Ufuk saw Yusuf Kaya coming from the mosque side. Ufuk stood up, waved, and called Yusuf Kaya over. Yusuf came, Your Honor, and we all sat and talked. Then I noticed my mother coming. She came and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Son, close the window, we’ll put the turkeys inside.”</span> I said okay, mom. I went with her. The window was hard to close, so I picked up a stone and a bottle to push it shut. After closing it, we put the turkeys inside.

I took my brother Muhammed and went down toward the mosque. I sent Muhammed to Azize Kaya’s house. I called out softly, <span class="quote-grey">“Narin, Narin,”</span> thinking maybe she was playing somewhere or distracted. When Muhammed came back and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Brother, she’s not there either,”</span> I raised my voice, calling <span class="quote-grey">“Narin, Narin”</span> louder. I went toward the fountain, the mosque, the school, but I couldn’t find her. When I came back toward the mosque again, I noticed my father Arif Güran had arrived, and by then the villagers were all up searching.

As the court, we do not take sides with any of the defendants. The way I treated Nevzat is the same way I treated Enes. If anyone has a different impression, please say so. If anyone says, <span class="quote-grey">“Your Honor, we got such an impression,”</span> I’ll leave my robe right here. I’m being very clear—I would leave my robe and withdraw from this case. I will show the same approach to Yüksel and to Salim. On Monday, I have another trial; I’ll act exactly the same there. I don’t look at any case based on who the defendant is. For me, this case has no special distinction from any other. If I ever made such a distinction, I would quit this profession—very clearly. If anyone here, including lawyers from the Diyarbakır Bar Association, can say the Presiding Judge shows a different level of attention in this case compared to others, I’ll step down immediately. Can anyone say that? Let someone from the Diyarbakır Bar say it. I’m saying this openly and clearly. I’ll even adjourn this hearing today if needed and withdraw from it. I show the same diligence in every case. Let me clarify that—to clear any doubts. I say the same thing to the press: for us, this case is just one of hundreds of cases we handle. It only receives more attention because it’s more significant in your eyes, and we respond with proportional care. We’ll continue on Monday as well. Monday we have a murder case with detained defendants; we’ll show the same diligence there. I show equal respect to every defendant. I’ve shown the same respect to drug dealers, to those accused of killing children, and to those accused of killing their spouses. Therefore, regarding our court’s stance—I’m explaining, not defending—I won’t engage with these allegations. Let there be no such doubt in anyone’s mind. The same respect I show you, I showed Nevzat. He’s not my father’s son, and neither are you. I’m seeing you for the first time. I’ll show the same respect to Ms.&nbsp;Yüksel and to Mr.&nbsp;Salim. I’m not even from Diyarbakır; I may be transferred this year or next. If anyone has any gossip or doubts about bias, please state it openly, so everyone knows the court stands above suspicion. Let me make that very clear. Mr.&nbsp;Nahit knows this, and so do you. I’ve been transparent from the beginning. Every time you spoke, I said <span class="quote-grey">“amenna”</span> and acted accordingly. I’m saying all this because of the impression I’ve received.<a href="#L361" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

Our mission has long been to fight against torture and ill-treatment, and we are proud of that. However, when we first took this case file and first met with the defendants—who were then suspects—they told us they had been subjected to inhuman treatment, that is, ill-treatment by law enforcement. As a former administrator of the Diyarbakır Bar on this matter, we were truly surprised by these allegations. The Bar President at the time had stated they were striving to shed light on the Narin case. We acted with that confidence, and when the hearing began, we stated that even though we are defense counsel, our aim is to serve a conclusion in accordance with justice and equity. With that service mindset…<a href="#L561" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

<div id="L568" class="anchored-line">
<p><span class="speaker kdb">Law. Nahit Eren :</span> <span class="utterance">Your Honor. A moment ago, you judges expressed your perspective and approach to this case. Please allow me to respond as well. My colleague reminded us that he served for many years on the bar’s executive board. Let me also remind you—we served together. He knows well how we fought against torture. The family came to me twice before spring; I believe I even heard someone from the family shouting at me from the gallery just now. The family came to me, and in all my meetings I met together with my fellow board members—who are all in the courtroom. When they first came, they told me this: while in custody, our relatives were subjected to ill-treatment and torture. I told them: since all the lawyers assigned from the Diyarbakır Bar Association under the CMK are CMK-appointed counsel, if there is any allegation of ill-treatment or torture, please make sure these are recorded in the minutes during the statement. I have three lawyer colleagues, and when the family members who came to the bar raised this allegation, I asked them: could you tell us to whom, and in what manner, it was done? Perhaps they are listening in the courtroom now. Some said a tooth was pulled; some said a nail was pulled; some said punches were thrown to the face, iron rods used on the head; some said they were taken before their mother with high-pressure water—many things were described. I said: please file an application with us regarding these matters; they were in the process of retaining counsel. I said: file an application with us about this. In fact, one of the family members called someone after the remand on the 12th and subsequent releases. <span class="quote-grey">“Come to the bar and explain what they did to you—file an application,”</span> he said. <span class="quote-grey">“I can’t come and file an application,”</span> he replied. And why did he say he wouldn’t apply? In short, they said they wouldn’t file any application on this matter. There has not been a single application to the Diyarbakır Bar Association concerning allegations of torture. This was the conversation. Afterwards, not only did the family refrain from making any application to us on this matter—regardless of this file or any file—if a suspect, perpetrator, defendant, whatever you call them, has been subjected to torture, we stand against that as well. We would continue the legal struggle for that too. But in the courtroom, let us avoid language and discourse that would put the institutional identity of the Diyarbakır Bar Association up for debate and place us as the target regarding our participation in this case. I am here so that those responsible for the violation of the right to life of eight-year-old Narin receive the punishment they deserve.<a href="#L568" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

That’s why I became suspicious when they questioned me. I’m telling the truth.<a href="#L926" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

<p><span class="speaker suspect">Enes Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">Let me explain the fire to you in detail, brother. Because I was there when it happened. The fire—well, there was Ömer Güran and a friend of his. We were sitting near the mosque. Ömer Güran was talking either on TikTok or with a sheikh, saying there’s water flowing in front of a house door and a broken tree. So we said, there’s Hacı Rıza Güran’s place—it could be there, because there’s a broken tree and water in front of the door. We went to check. We looked around everywhere, found nothing. And at the moment we were about to leave toward Hacı Rıza Güran’s garden and enter near Erhan Güran’s house, the wires hit each other. I was standing under the wire outside the garden, not inside. Then suddenly, the fire started. When they tried to extinguish that part, it spread to my side. It happened four or five times in a row, my Lord. Which fire should I try to put out?<a href="#L957" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

</div>
<div id="L987" class="anchored-line">
<p><span class="speaker mudafi-enes">Law. Mustafa Demir :</span> <span class="utterance">Their inclusion in the file is already debatable—that’s a separate matter. We didn’t object to it then, because everyone already knew everything. We didn’t want it to seem like we were hiding something. We have no such concern. We said, <span class="quote-grey">“Let it be discussed.”</span> But we also want to state here that since these recordings constitute <em>illegally obtained evidence</em>, they should be removed from the file. Why? Because the conversations were cut and edited. If the full conversations were listened to—there are two calls—one with his brother Eren, and one with his six-year-old brother. In that call, he says, <span class="quote-grey">“Don’t talk to anyone.”</span> But if you listen to the beginning, it’s about normal things—<span class="quote-grey">“How are you, brother? I’m fine,”</span> he says. <span class="quote-grey">“I’m working here, don’t worry.”</span> Let’s not forget—his six-year-old brother lost his sister. The whole family was devastated. His mother was detained, the child lost his sister, one brother is gone, and the father is completely exhausted. So trying to protect the child from others’ words is a <em>human reaction</em>. Taking only that sentence—<span class="quote-grey">“Don’t talk to anyone”</span>—out of context to twist it is unfair. The indictment itself is forced. Soon we’ll show many examples. For instance, the question about the phone and WhatsApp—you’ll see what it really means. Everyone will understand. The precedent cited here is from the 18th Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation, 2016. In that case, a convicted person insulted a deputy director during a prison call. The trial court convicted him; the Court of Cassation overturned it. The Chief Public Prosecutor appealed under Article 308, and by majority vote—not unanimous—a ruling was made. It stated: <span class="quote-grey">“If a person is detained or convicted, they are under the state’s supervision. Monitoring is permissible to prevent or detect crimes.”</span> But that’s to <em>prevent a new crime</em>, not to prosecute a person already in custody. Our situation is entirely different.<a href="#L987" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

</div>
<div id="L989" class="anchored-line">
<p><span class="speaker mudafi-enes">Law. Mustafa Demir :</span> <span class="utterance">Article 135 of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly regulates this. These cannot be used as evidence. My client has already explained his concerns openly. Everyone listened to selective parts of the conversations—let them listen to <em>all</em> of them. If they’re public everywhere, let everyone hear the full context—how the child cried, how the family struggled to talk at first, and what happened later. We’re stating clearly that this is <em>illegally obtained evidence</em>. We didn’t object at first, but as you’ll see throughout the case, there are multiple such examples. This is one of them, and we’re formally objecting to this evidence.<a href="#L989" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>
