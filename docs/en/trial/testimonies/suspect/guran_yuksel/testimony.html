<p><span class="speaker suspect">Yüksel Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">I woke up at 5. At five I went to pick okra in my garden. I picked the okra and came back — looked around, and saw a dead turkey in front of the house. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“The dog must have eaten our turkey.”</span> I came home around six, six-thirty, woke up Osman, and sent him to work in Ongözlü. When Arif had come home late the night before, and his mother returned from the bus station, he’d said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, wake me a little early in the morning. I’m going to Batman.”</span> So, in the morning, I went to pick okra, sent Osman off, and went into the kitchen. I was so happy — two or three of my sons had come home from working abroad. I was cooking, frying things — I couldn’t get enough joy from it. Then my other children started coming downstairs one by one. While I was finishing breakfast, I told them, <span class="quote-grey">“Wake your father and your older brother, have them come down.”</span> Then I saw Arif talking on the phone with Muzaffer. I don’t know who called who. He said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel,”</span> and told me, <span class="quote-grey">“Muzaffer will come for breakfast.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Okay.”</span> Muzaffer came. We left the table as it was. I was so happy that day. Something inside me said, <span class="quote-grey">“I could die now. Osman is the only one missing from us. May God not accept my wish. This is our last joyful breakfast.”</span> I’m telling this to everyone.<a href="#L006" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

<div id="L010" class="anchored-line">
<p><span class="speaker suspect">Yüksel Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">I’m saying this before everyone. After breakfast, Muzaffer, Arif, and Baran left together. Muzaffer and Arif were going to Batman. Baran was taking his wife shopping. Then I told my son Enes, <span class="quote-grey">“Go take a bath.”</span> Because Enes is young, he forgets things. I saw from the statements he mentioned events out of order. After Enes came out of the bathroom, I also washed Narin and Eren. Then I called my sister. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“My washing machine is broken.”</span> Hediye— no, my sister Salihe Güran. I called her and she said, <span class="quote-grey">“Sister, I have two loads of laundry. Bring them after noon.”</span> Then I called my sister-in-law, Hediye Güran. She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Bring them.”</span> I told Enes, <span class="quote-grey">“I’ll take the clothes to Hediye.”</span> She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Okay, bring them.”</span> All the clothes belonged to Enes. I took them to Hediye Güran’s house, carried them into the kitchen. She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Sit,”</span> but I didn’t sit.<a href="#L010" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

<div id="L012" class="anchored-line">
<p><span class="speaker suspect">Yüksel Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">Morning. I’m talking about before noon now. In the morning, Narin was still at home.<a href="#L012" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

</div>
<div id="L014" class="anchored-line">
<p><span class="speaker suspect">Yüksel Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">Yes. When I came back from Hediye’s, Narin and Eren were playing on the balcony. They were very happy. I went inside because my other children were home. I did my chores. Sometimes Eren or Enes and Narin would run to me: <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, when are we going to buy clothes?”</span> <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, will you buy me a wedding dress?”</span> <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, buy me this.”</span> I told my daughter, <span class="quote-grey">“Okay, dear. I promise, I’ll buy it tomorrow.”</span> May God not forgive them — they didn’t let me buy her that dress. Then she’d run to her brothers: <span class="quote-grey">“Brother, why didn’t you bring me a toy?”</span> <span class="quote-grey">“My boss didn’t pay me yet, but I promise, when I get money, I’ll buy one for you.”</span> I finished my chores and washed the balcony. When I looked, my older sons were happy inside. I turned off the water pump. My uncle’s daughter-in-law had come from Batman; she was staying at my sister’s. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Let me go and say welcome.”</span> I went — they were in the kitchen drinking tea and coffee. I sat with them; they brought me coffee too. I drank it, sat a while, then Ferhat Kaya came and said — I think it was Enes or Eren, I don’t remember — he said, <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, come home, we’re hungry.”</span> I went home, because we had a wedding soon. When I got there, Muhammed had a music device and was playing songs. I took Narin and Eren by the hand, and we danced a little.<a href="#L014" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

Make us fries.”</span> Luckily, I made them. I fried potatoes and gave some to my daughter. I was preparing lunch. I saw Muhammed and Narin fighting over the phone. I took it away.

<p><span class="speaker suspect">Yüksel Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">When we sat down to eat, I remember it well. I looked at the clock; it was 1:00. We ate, I washed the dishes, vacuumed the rug, and sat on the couch. I saw Narin dusting the TV. She glanced at the clock. Because the night before, when we visited Hüseyin Güran, Hatice told her, <span class="quote-grey">“Come tomorrow — we’re going to Qur’an class.”</span> She glanced at the clock and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, I’m late for Qur’an class.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Don’t go, it’s too hot.”</span> I tried to stop her, but she insisted. <span class="quote-grey">“Please, Mom, it ends at 4:00, and then I’ll go to Hatice and Fatma’s.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Don’t go. Your uncle is sick.”</span> I couldn’t convince her. She convinced me instead. She got up happily, shouted with joy, and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Class ends at 4, then I’ll play with Hatice until evening.”</span> Normally, kids in the village go out at 5 and stay out till dark — we have to drag them home. She went to Qur’an class. I even told her, <span class="quote-grey">“Dear, you shouldn’t go out with those legs.”</span> She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, I’ll change my clothes.”</span> I swear — when Narin walked out of that room, I never saw her again. Enes and I were sitting together; he was playing on the phone. Nothing seemed unusual. Enes even said, <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, if my boss doesn’t pay, how will we afford my brother’s wedding before he goes to the army?”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Don’t worry, your father will handle it.”</span> I was tired — I’d been up since five. Enes had come home at midnight. I lay down; I don’t know how long I slept. When I got up, Muhammed was asleep, Enes was asleep, and Eren was playing on the phone. I went to the kitchen, drank some water, came back, and lay down again. When I woke up again, Muhammed and Eren were awake, Enes was still asleep. They told me, <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, aunt Hediye brought our clothes.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Why didn’t you wake me?”</span> They said, <span class="quote-grey">“Aunt Hediye didn’t let us.”</span> I was tidying the room. I don’t remember if Muhammed went out then. Enes woke up after that. I told Hediye, <span class="quote-grey">“The boys told me you came while I was asleep.”</span> She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yes, I came, but you were sleeping. I said, ‘Let her rest.’”</span> The water pump is near the headman’s gate. I ran it, got water, and went to turn it off. Hediye came again; we sat and talked — about clothes, the wedding, Baran’s military service. Then I remembered to get Enes’s suitcase and clothes from the room. I was folding them when Enes’s phone rang — I think twice. I didn’t let it wake him. He answered and spoke to a friend. I asked, <span class="quote-grey">“Who was it, son?”</span> He said, <span class="quote-grey">“My friend.”</span> He also asked his aunt something, and she asked him back. Then Enes went out. I don’t know how long he stayed out. Hediye and I kept talking. I didn’t check the time. I just know it was toward evening. Then Hediye said, <span class="quote-grey">“I’ll go home.”</span> We went to the door. Then I saw Enes coming.<a href="#L032" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

I asked Enes, <span class="quote-grey">“Where were you?”</span> He said, <span class="quote-grey">“By the fountain.”</span> He mentioned the mosque too — I don’t recall exactly. I went to the kitchen, saw Enes go into the TV room. I told him, <span class="quote-grey">“Call your father — where is he?”</span> When he called, his father said, <span class="quote-grey">“I’m in Batman, in Melkişköy.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“He won’t make it for dinner.”</span> I already knew Baran and Sultan were going to eat at uncle Kurtuluş’s that evening. I put the meat on the stove and tidied the house a bit. Around then, Enes must have gone out. Later, the officer asked me, <span class="quote-grey">“Did you see Salim that day?”</span> I swore, <span class="quote-grey">“Commander, I never saw him.”</span> Then I remembered — when I turned off the power switch, I could see Hüseyin Güran’s gate. Hüseyin and his sister were there. I think it was Salim I saw there for a moment — just a second, standing by the gate. Then the commander asked again, and I said I wasn’t sure — but maybe, for that second, I saw Salim by Hüseyin Güran’s gate.<a href="#L047" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

<p><span class="speaker suspect">Yüksel Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">Enes came. We closed the barn window. I put the turkeys inside for two minutes. Then I went to the headman’s house. Because Melek’s father had eye surgery. Nazan was there. Dilek was there. Gamze was there. I went and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Get well soon. How is your father?”</span> They said, <span class="quote-grey">“Thank God, he’s fine.”</span> While we were talking, I said, <span class="quote-grey">“I’d better go — my rice will burn.”</span> I ran home. When I got there, I saw Muhammed coming from that direction, Eren coming, Enes too. The kids said they were hungry. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Muhammed, we’re calling each other from the hilltop — call Narin, tell her to come home.”</span> I ran to the kitchen. I think it was Eren — I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Son, set the table.”</span> As I was putting the rice on the stove, Muhammed came into the kitchen and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, Narin isn’t there.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“What do you mean she isn’t there? Narin went that way.”</span> He said, <span class="quote-grey">“Aunt Hediye said Narin is here.”</span> Then I called Hediye. She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, Narin isn’t here — maybe she went to Damla or Ecrin or Yasemin or Gül.”</span> I went up the hill. I sent Enes and Muhammed down and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Go to the mosque, Narin must be there, bring her back.”</span> It never crossed our minds that Narin was missing. I called up to Maşallah on the hill. Maşallah said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, Narin isn’t here.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Tell the girls, Narin was going to visit you.”</span> He spoke to them, but I couldn’t hear the girls’ voices. He said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, I swear, Narin isn’t here.”</span> I didn’t know she hadn’t gone there after noon. I thought she might have gone, then left. It didn’t occur to me she was missing. She hadn’t gone to the mosque either. Then my sister Süveyla was there, filling hay. I asked, <span class="quote-grey">“Did Narin go to İbrahim’s daughter’s house?”</span> She said, <span class="quote-grey">“No, İbrahim just came back from the hospital with his daughter. Where would Narin go? Either to Hediye’s or Yasemin’s.”</span> I called Hediye again, since I’d already called before. She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, the girls haven’t come yet.”</span> I told Eren to get Yasemin’s number — I didn’t have it. Eren and Muhammed were there, I don’t remember exactly. We called Yasemin. She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, Narin isn’t here.”</span> I called my sister Saliha Kaya — I knew her number from Eren’s phone photo. Her daughter answered and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Aunt, Narin hasn’t come here.”</span> Then I thought of her aunt Azize Kaya. Azize had told her, <span class="quote-grey">“Narin, don’t go — we’ll go together in the evening.”</span> I ran there, knocked on Azize’s door, asked, <span class="quote-grey">“Did Narin come here?”</span> She said, <span class="quote-grey">“No, Yüksel, she didn’t.”</span> I got scared. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“The mosque is big; it’s under construction. Maybe she was playing there and got hurt.”</span> I ran to the mosque, banged on the door with both hands: <span class="quote-grey">“Open the door! Narin is missing!”</span> People gathered around. I saw İsa Kaya beside me. He said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, Narin was here at six.”</span> When he said that, I relaxed a little. I thought, <span class="quote-grey">“She must be with her school friends, playing with the carrots.”</span> We all started searching — up and down, everywhere, looking for Narin. We couldn’t find her. Even Gazal, Nevzo’s wife, came with me, comforting me: <span class="quote-grey">“Don’t worry, Yüksel, nothing’s wrong. Maybe she fell asleep somewhere.”</span> I remember it clearly. She said she’d once fallen asleep in a field overnight. She was trying to calm me. Soon everyone in the village was looking for Narin — every hole, every pit, every dangerous place, we checked. I don’t know who called the gendarmerie, but suddenly the world came crashing down on us. Everyone was on their phones, calling each other. It felt like the whole world had come into Tavşantepe.<a href="#L085" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

<p><span class="speaker suspect">Yüksel Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">No, absolutely not. We never said that. I swear, I have never said anything about killing Narin. As I said before, there was Hüseyin Kaya. He said at around three o’clock — I know a few minutes after that — a car came honking fast and stopped in front of our house. My mind was completely on that car. I said to myself, <span class="quote-grey">“Narin must have come, or someone has kidnapped her.”</span> We even mentioned the Bingöl girl — I swear, I had lost myself completely. My family laid me down on the couch. Then my sister-in-law came and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, get up, someone is asking for you.”</span> I barely got up, and a woman came, hugged me around the neck, and cried. I was already crying. She said, <span class="quote-grey">“My mother is bedridden and sick. I lost my brother. Go to Yüksel’s side.”</span> I didn’t even recognize her.

I’ll tell you something.”</span> I said to myself, <span class="quote-grey">“God, what is this commander going to say to me?”</span> She didn’t come the first day, but came the second day. Same thing — she went to the restroom, I took her into the bedroom. She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, in Ankara, there’s an apartment where your photo is.

<p><span class="speaker suspect">Yüksel Güran :</span> <span class="utterance">A few days before the incident, my daughter came home holding twenty million lira. She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Mom, look, I have money.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Where did you get that money, my girl?”</span> She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Brother Nevzat gave it to me.”</span> Later, I mentioned this to the judge, but not to the prosecutor. When Nevzat was arrested and put into custody, that’s when it came to my mind. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“My daughter, shame on him — why would he give you money?”</span> He had also given money to Süheyla. Then I didn’t think about it again. Now he comes out and says, <span class="quote-grey">“She was here, she was there.”</span> I said before too — they claimed there was DNA in Salim’s car. They said he gave her something by the roadside. As a mother, my heart and mind were overwhelmed — I thought, <span class="quote-grey">“Oh God, this man has lost his mind and killed my daughter.”</span> Later his statements kept changing — then he said it happened inside the house. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“He’s lying.”</span> If he had said it happened on the road, the DNA would’ve shown up in his car. He would’ve said, <span class="quote-grey">“I threatened her, gave her something on the road.”</span> Maybe, for a moment, my mother’s heart believed it — maybe he did it. But then I swore, that dishonorable man never set foot in our home.<a href="#L591" class="line-anchor" aria-label="Bu satıra bağlantı">​</a></span></p>

So if there was no hostility, and you were on good terms — could it be that Nevzat was doing something wrong? We asked before whether you or Enes had any sexual relations with him.

Why?”</span> Gazal laughed and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Don’t mind her.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“I really don’t know.”</span> I thought it was because of the car. Hatiye Zeyno wasn’t speaking to us because of that car issue. Gazal said, <span class="quote-grey">“Forget her.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Honestly, Gazal, I didn’t know anything about this.”</span> One day Arif said he was going to the headman’s house. I told Gazal. I said, <span class="quote-grey">“No, Nevzat bought a car — it turned out stolen. We’re going there to talk about it.”</span> Arif came back and said, <span class="quote-grey">“We’re having a meeting. Neither of us nor anyone else will handle it. Cevat Kaya will come. Rukedin Kaya brought him. We’ll do what they suggest.”</span> Then Gazal said, <span class="quote-grey">“Yüksel, neither Cevat Kaya nor Rukedin Kaya — they all took Salim’s side. They put the blame for the money on Nevzat.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“I don’t know about any of that.”</span> She said, <span class="quote-grey">“Ferhat refused to pay that money. He said, ‘Even if I kill myself or someone else, I won’t pay it.’”</span> İbrahim, his son, said, <span class="quote-grey">“That’s shameful. If Salim doesn’t pay and Arif doesn’t pay, where will it come from? It’s not a small amount.”</span> Then I saw Arif and Nevzat talking up on the hill. I went over and said, <span class="quote-grey">“Welcome, Nevzat.”</span> They were talking about the money. Arif said, <span class="quote-grey">“I’ll give it to the lawyer. Once the lawyer settles it, we’ll pay you back.”</span> Nevzat said, <span class="quote-grey">“Fine.”</span> I said, <span class="quote-grey">“That’s good. We’ve been neighbors for years — it’s not a huge amount. Just settle it.”</span> Our children were all friends. Then I said, <span class="quote-grey">“Congrats on your new house.”</span> He talked with my husband and left. I never thought about that car again. I never told my husband, my kids, or anyone about what Ferhat said. They made up things, but we had nothing to do with it. If we had, we would’ve said so.
